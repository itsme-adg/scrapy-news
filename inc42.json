        "Article Content": "Shares of  Paytm  jumped almost 10% during the intraday trading today (September 10) to INR 687.3 apiece on the BSE amid strong trading volumes and ambiguity around the introduction of GST on small digital payments. However, the stock shed some of the gains and was trading 4.6% higher at INR 657 apiece on the BSE at 1:39 PM. By the time of publishing the story, nearly 3 Cr Paytm shares had cumulatively changed hands on the NSE and BSE as compared to the 20-day average volume of 90.3 Lakh. The rally in Paytm share prices could also have been fueled by the GST Council\u2019s failure to reach a decision on imposing a 18% GST on payment aggregators on UPI transactions under INR 2,000. Reports suggest that the matter will be referred to a fitment committee. It is pertinent to note that payment aggregators such as Paytm, Razorpay, Cashfree, Pine Labs, BillDesk and CCAvenue charge merchants for processing digital transactions under INR 2,000. Some of these players have reportedly received GST demand orders from authorities on the fee they collected. This comes at a time when Paytm has  received approval from the Centre , the finance ministry and the department of financial services to invest INR 50 Cr in its payments arm, Paytm Payments Bank. The company is now looking to apply for a payment aggregator licence with the Reserve Bank of India. Paytm incorporated Paytm Payment Services to secure a PA licence. While the company initially tried to get the PA licence in 2020, the RBI directed it to  resubmit the application  to ensure compliance with the FDI rules.\u00a0 The Vijay Shekhar Sharma-led company saw its consolidated net loss widen 134% year-on-year to INR 840.1 Cr in the June quarter (Q1) of the financial year 2024-25 (FY25) as compared to INR 358.4 Cr in the year ago-period. Revenue from operations declined 36% in Q1 FY25 to INR 1,502 Cr from INR 2,342 Cr in the corresponding quarter last year. Despite mounting losses, the stock has jumped 27% in the last month and surged over 77% in the past six months. \u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Trade financing startup  Drip Capital  has raised a funding of $113 Mn in a mix of debt and equity.\u00a0 While Japanese investors GMO Payment Gateway and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) infused $23 Mn in equity financing, the startup raised $90 Mn debt from International Financing Corporation (IFC) and East West Bank. In a statement, the startup said that the capital will support its market expansion plans and help it develop new products tailored to customer needs. Founded in 2015 by Pushkar Mukewar and Neil Kothari, Drip Capital offers digitised trade financing solutions to small and medium business (SMB) clients in India, the US, and Mexico.\u00a0 The startup claimed that it has seen its revenue quadruple over the past two years while its customer base has doubled in the period. Further, it said it has expanded its services for SMBs by integrating forex and risk analytics solutions with its core trade financing products.\u00a0 Drip Capital said that it collaborates with over 9,000 sellers and buyers across 100+ countries. Mukewar told Financial Express that the startup has financed over 1.99 Lakh invoices involving $6.5 Bn since last year. Further, he claimed that it has a user base of over 2,700.\u00a0 \u201cIn 2022 and 2023, the global trade sector faced significant challenges, including rising interest rates that squeezed margins and restricted capital access for SMBs. Despite these challenges, Drip has emerged as the preferred trade finance platform for SMBs in the US and India\u2026 We\u2019ve achieved cash profitability and expanded our business during this period,\u201d Mukewar said.\u00a0 Commenting on the funding, GMO Payment\u2019s executive vice president Ryu Muramatsu said, \u201cWe are proud to have supported Drip from its inception through both equity investment and debt financing\u2026 Drip\u2019s innovative and comprehensive solutions in digital trade finance are transforming how SMBs engage in trade. We believe Drip\u2019s technology and proprietary underwriting are uniquely positioned to address the challenges in this space.\u201d Drip Capital last  raised $175 Mn  from investors like TI Platform, Accel, Peak XV (then Sequoia India), Wing VC, Irongrey, and GC1 Holdings in 2021. In late 2022, the startup  laid off about 20% of its 400-member workforce  in a restructuring exercise.\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Listed stockbroking firm Angel One is reportedly set to rope in Arief Mohamad as its new chief business officer. As per ET\u2019s report, citing sources, Mohamad has already put in his papers at Flipkart, where he was heading the fashion vertical. Angel One has declined to comment to the queries of Inc42. As per Mohamad\u2019s LinkedIn profile, he has been working with Flipkart for over nine years under various roles. He served as the vice president \u2013 head of fashion since November 2023.\u00a0 Prior to that he has also worked with the FMCG chain SPAR for three years under various positions. He worked with SPAR as associate vice president and head of FMCG (B&M) before he left the company. Mohamad will be taking over the position which was held by Prateek Mehta in Angel One. Mehta worked with the trading firm for 18 months as executive director and chief business officer before he stepped down from the role. Prior to that, he founded Scripbox and has held the leadership positions until 2022.\u00a0 Currently, he works with an investment company South Park Commons as a partner since July 2024. At a time where Walmart is planning the IPO of its ecommerce subsidiary, Flipkart\u2019s former executives are being fished to lead senior positions in other companies. For instance, foodtech major Swiggy  roped  in Flipkart\u2019s former senior vice president Amitesh Jha as chief executive officer of its quick commerce business Instamart, a week ago. Also, in May, ecommerce platform Meesho  roped in  former senior vice president and head of product Surojit Chatterjee as an independent director to its board. Angel One, despite facing allegations of  data breach , since 2023, the Mumbai-based trading portal  acquired  2.2 Lakh active investors in June, as per the NSE data. As per reports, Angel One is also speeding up to pull in more users every month than Zerodha and is likely to surpass the latter soon. Updated at 05.53 PM",

        "Article Content": "Just over two months after foraying into the  automotive sector , insurtech unicorn  Acko  Tech has rolled out Acko flexi term life insurance plan to offer flexible coverage, allowing policyholders to adjust the amount as financial responsibilities change. With this launch, the company aims to become a one-stop destination for all protection needs. The plan provides comprehensive coverage, offering customers financial protection throughout their lives, it said in a statement. As per the company, the plan provides the option to modify the policy duration to fit life goals, whether for short-term or long-term protection.\u00a0 Besides, it will provide flexibility by allowing customers to switch between different payout options at any time during the policy. Policyholders can select from a lump sum, monthly instalments, or an annuity, tailoring their payouts to meet their changing financial needs, even during the claims process. Varun Dua, founder, Acko, said in a statement, \u201cWe wanted customers to look at life insurance not as a means of investment, but as pure-play protection for them and their families. Our focus going forward will continue to be on pure-protection related products such as the term life product that we have launched recently.\u201d Founded in 2016 by Varun Dua and Ruchi Deepak, Acko offers insurance for vehicles, health and travel. It counts the likes of General Atlantic, Multiples Private Equity, Lightspeed, and Intact Ventures among its investors. Last year, it also launched an insurance plan for batteries of electric vehicles (EVs).\u00a0 This comes months after Acko  bought digital chronic care management company OneCare to build a comprehensive healthcare ecosystem. The company claims to have distributed insurance policies to over 78 Mn unique customers and issued more than 1 Bn policies to date.\u00a0 Acko has raised over $450 Mn in total funding from investors, including Amazon, General Atlantic and Multiples Private Equity. In FY23,  the startup reported a net loss  of INR 738.5 Cr, up 53% year-on-year, while its operating revenue grew 32% to INR 1,758.6 Cr.",

        "Author URL": "https://inc42.com/author/bhupendra-paintola/",
        "Article Content": "Delhi\u2019s Saket district court has refused to grant bail to vendor Amit Kumar Bansal, who was  arrested by the Delhi Police\u2019s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) a month back  as part of its investigation in the alleged INR 82 Cr fraud at fintech unicorn BharatPe. \u201cWithout delving into the merits of the case at this stage, there is prima facie evidence linking the accused to the offences. Prima facie, it seems that the offence is serious in nature, involving an amount of at least INR 30 Cr,\u201d as per the court\u2019s order accessed by Inc42.\u00a0 The court further emphasised the necessity of continuing Bansal\u2019s custodial interrogation as part of the ongoing investigation. It also noted that Bansal was involved with several non-existent companies that issued fraudulent invoices. \u201cThe verification of invoices casts doubt on the transactions, as the invoices appear to have been falsified with incorrect details,\u201d the court added. Bansal\u2019s defence counsel argued that the accused had been falsely implicated and  it was his deceased brother Ravi Bansal who managed the business dealings. It added that Bansal received no funds and no amount was transferred to his bank account. Bansal\u2019s council further pointed out that both his father and mother are suffering from serious ailments and even the family of his deceased brother is dependent on him, asking for the bail application to be allowed.\u00a0 BharatPe  contended that 33 non-existing firms raised invoices amounting to approximately INR 72 Cr for the supply of QR standees and accessories. Out of these 33 firms, 23 are non-existent and are related to the accused Amit Kumar Bansal. The court added that as per investigation, both Ravi Bansal (since deceased) and Amit Kumar Bansal, were associated with most of these non-existing vendors or firms.\u00a0 A common email address ( [email\u00a0protected] )  was used for these activities and it was found to be operated by Amit Kumar Bansal.\u00a0 Arguing this, Bansal\u2019s council claimed that his brother was using this email ID. To this, the court said the email ID was for a considerable period even after his brother\u2019s death and the notion of the applicant\u2019s brother using the applicant\u2019s email account to frequently raise invoices and place purchase orders seems improbable.\u00a0 The court order added, \u201cIt is observed that the brother has now passed away, and for a considerable period of time, the email ID was used, likely with the applicant\u2019s consent. In today\u2019s era, it is unimaginable that a person, even with average schooling, cannot open an email account.\u201d \u201cThere are also allegations that Bansal has deleted the email account, raising the possibility that evidence in this case may be tampered with,\u201d the District court added.\u00a0 Currently held in police remand at the EOW office in Mandir Marg, New Delhi, Bansal will be presented before the court on Monday. Bansal was arrested by the  EOW of the Delhi Police on August 6 , following an FIR lodged against BharatPe cofounder Ashneer Grover and others for orchestrating financial losses through fraud.\u00a0 BharatPe\u2019s complaint against ousted cofounder Grover, wife Madhuri and family members, including Deepak Gupta, Suresh Jain, and Shwetank Jain was  registered  by the EOW in May 2023. BharatPe has accused Grover and his family of causing a loss of around INR 81.3 Cr to the company.\u00a0 This was allegedly done through fake payments to human resource consultants, inflated payments to vendors linked to the accused, fraudulent transactions for tax credit, penalties paid to GST authorities, illegal payments to travel agencies, and forged invoices by Jain, along with the destruction of evidence. The EOW also  discovered a host of unexplained payments  made to allegedly fake HR consultancies by Ashneer and Madhuri during their course of employment at the company.\u00a0 While Ashneer was a cofounder at BharatPe, Madhuri was the head of controls, a role which encompassed overseeing the company\u2019s finances and regulatory compliance. Besides the EOW case, BharatPe filed a civil suit with the Delhi High Court in November last year seeking  INR 88.67 Cr in damages  from Ashneer and Madhuri.\u00a0 It is pertinent to note that Ashneer is embattling a slew of legal cases against its founded company BharatPe. He is also stuck in litigation over shares held by him for BharatPe founder Shashvat Nakrani and  cofounder Bhavik Koladiya.  Both are subject matters of two separate cases currently being heard by the Delhi HC.\u00a0 Last month, the Delhi HC  appointed a sole arbitrator  to address the ongoing legal dispute between BharatPe and Ashneer Grover on his alleged \u2018confidentiality breach\u2019 under his employment pact. \u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Tax authorities have reportedly issued notices to at least two major payment aggregators (PA), CCAvenue and BillDesk, demanding goods and services tax (GST) for facilitating digital payments below INR 2,000.\u00a0 Multiple people privy to the development told Economic Times that tax authorities have sought GST on the fee charged by PAs to merchants for processing such low-value digital transactions via debit and credit cards.\u00a0 As per the report, notices have been issued pertaining to demands from as far back as fiscal year 2017-18 (FY18), when the GST regime came into effect.\u00a0 Confirming the development, CCAvenue parent Infibeam Avenues\u2019 managing director and Payments Council of India chairman Vishwas Patel said, \u201cYes, we have received a show-cause-cum-demand notice\u2026 Our teams have responded to the notice\u201d. The development comes close on the heels of reports emerging that the GST Council plans to discuss a proposal next week to  impose an 18% GST levy on payment aggregators  for processing online payments under INR 2,000.\u00a0 A top executive of a payments firm anonymously told the publication, \u201cSome of the players have already received the notice. We are anticipating notices too, since the entire industry did not charge merchants and pay GST on sub-INR 2,000 digital payments transactions, abiding by government norms.\u201d The move is expected to have a direct bearing on the payment aggregator ecosystem as well as the larger fintech ecosystem. Some of the large players in the segment include Pine Labs, Razorpay, PayU, Infibeam, among others.\u00a0 The levy is expected to create additional financial burden for these companies as PAs have not been charging tax to merchants on such transactions as a government notification issued during demonetisation in 2016 exempted sub-INR 2,000 digital payments from taxes. Currently, these PAs charge anywhere between 0.5% to 2% as payment gateway fees per transaction.\u00a0 As a result, they may be saddled with additional compliance burdens and costs as more than 80% of the total digital payments in India, by value, is less than INR 2,000. The fintech startups may eventually pass on these expenditures to the merchants or end-users. However, it must be noted that the tax issue pertains to transactions done through debit and credit cards and net banking. UPI and RuPay credit card payments are exempted from it as they enjoy zero merchant discount rate.\u00a0 The developments come at a time when the number of digital transactions in the country are growing rapidly. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has doled out PA licences to a number of entities this year. Earlier today, Chennai-based  Paysharp received final authorisation from the RBI  to operate as a PA. Prior to that, PayGlocal also received a nod from the central bank to operate as an online PA.\u00a0 As per a report, the homegrown payment gateway market is estimated to grow to a size of $2.66 Bn by 2029.",

        "Article Content": "Vivek Bansal has reportedly stepped down as InCred\u2019s group chief financial officer (CFO) after a six-year stint at the fintech company and is set to launch his own MSME-focussed NBFC venture, Saarathi Finance. Bansal has joined hands with Sunil Daga, president of Kotak Mahindra Bank, for his new venture, Moneycontrol reported, adding that both executives have resigned from their respective companies and are in talks with investors to raise funds for Saarathi Finance. Inc42 has reached out to Bansal for confirmation. The story will be updated based on the response. The LinkedIn profiles of both executives showed them still working at their respective firms. However, the report said that they are currently serving their notice periods. As per the report, Saarathi Finance is registered in Mumbai and has sought approval from the Reserve Bank of India to operate as a non-banking financial company (NBFC). The company is reportedly in talks with investors to raise INR 600 Cr at a likely valuation of INR 1,000 Cr. Of these, some equity infusion might come from Bansal and Daga. Upon getting the NBFC licence, Saarathi Finance plans to offer secured loans to MSMEs in the range of INR 5 Lakh-20 Lakh and unsecured loans to individuals with a ticket size of INR 1 Lakh-5 Lakh, as per the report. The company also reportedly plans to launch a digital-first B2B2C super app to cater to borrowers in urban and semi-urban regions, which will put it in direct competition with players like Bajaj Finserv, Indifi, Lendingkart, FlexiLoans and InCred, among others. This comes at a time when NBFCs, especially targeted at the under-served MSME sector, are attracting significant investor interest. For instance, in June, lending tech startup Aye Finance  raised a debt funding of INR 250 Cr  (around $30 Mn) from Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO. The same month, Arthan Finance also  raised INR 50 Cr in its Series B funding  round led by Incofin India Progress Fund. Last month, fintech startup FlexiLoans  secured a debt funding of INR 75 Cr  (around $9 Mn) from JM Financials through private placement of non-convertible debentures (NCDs). According to Inc42 analysis, the Indian lending tech market is poised to reach a market size of $1.3 Tn by 2030.\u00a0 \u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Multiparty computation wallet infrastructure provider Liminal has yet again blamed WazirX for the $230 Mn exploit, claiming that a forensic analysis found no evidence that the cyber attack originated from its web application. Liminal hired audit and forensics company Grant Thornton to conduct a comprehensive review of its web application including the front end, User Interface (UI), and backend of Liminal\u2019s infrastructure. After hackers stole $234.9 Mn in crypto assets from WazirX in July, Liminal began an in-house probe and consulted with third-party auditors to carry out a forensic investigation of its infrastructure. Preliminary findings found a \u201cmismatch\u201d between data shared by Liminal and the payload received from WazirX\u2019s systems, which hinted at a potential compromise either at WazirX\u2019s end or within Liminal\u2019s frontend systems, the company said. A further investigation into the discrepancy found \u201cno evidence of compromise or vulnerabilities related to the transaction workflow\u201d on Liminal\u2019s end, it added. The findings suggest that the issue likely originated from outside Liminal\u2019s infrastructure, the company said, pointing the finger at WazirX \u2014 yet again. \u201cWe reiterate that the product in question for this incident is our self-custody wallet infrastructure, wherein a majority of the private keys that control and operate the wallets remain with our clients on their infrastructure. In this product, Liminal can never initiate a transaction and all transactions always originate at our client\u2019s end first,\u201d it said. Queries sent to WazirX did not elicit any response by the time of publishing this story. It is pertinent to note that WazirX\u2019s multisig wallet that was compromised in the attack was using Liminal\u2019s digital asset custody service. The hacked Safe Multisig wallet required six signatories, from which five were of the WazirX and one from infrastructure and custody partner Liminal. WazirX and Liminal have been continuously blaming each other for the hack, leaving users in the dark about the security of funds. In a blog post on July 18 \u2014 the day of the hack \u2014 WazirX said the attack stemmed from a \u201cdiscrepancy between the data displayed on Liminal\u2019s interface and the transaction\u2019s actual contents.\u201d Nearly a month after the $230 Mn crypto heist, WazirX on August 14 said it was  ending its relationship with Liminal  and moving its funds into new multisig wallets. Consequently, WazirX said that a forensic probe by Mandiant, a subsidiary of Google, into the hack found that its laptops and systems were not compromised and that findings largely indicated that the cyberattack originated from Liminal. This comes at a time when WazirX is looking for \u201cwhite knights\u201d to bail it out after it was hit by a cyberattack, allegedly by North Korean hackers. WazirX parent Zettai has moved the Singapore High Court seeking a moratorium as part of its restructuring plans. WazirX will either sell off some assets or form strategic partnerships with investors under the scheme of arrangement. The hacked exchange has also been facing flak in India, with CoinSwitch  threatening to take legal action against the hacked crypto exchange  to recover 2% of its trapped funds. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Fintech giant  Paytm  has allotted 2.54 Lakh equity shares to eligible employees under its  employee stock option plan (ESOP) .\u00a0 In an exchange filing on Wednesday (September 4), Paytm said that the nomination and remuneration committee of its board approved the allotment of 2.54 Lakh equity shares, with a face value of INR 1 each, as fully paid-up to the eligible employees.\u00a0 Of these, 2,54,288 shares have been allotted under Employee Stock Option Scheme 2019 and 620 shares have been allotted under Employee Stock Option Scheme 2008.\u00a0 With the fresh allotment, the issued, subscribed and paid-up equity share capital of Paytm has increased to INR 63.66 Cr from INR 63.63 Cr earlier. As per Paytm\u2019s last closing price, the value of the freshly allotted shares stand at INR 5.65 Cr. The exercise price for the allotted shares is INR 9 apiece. The development comes at a time when a number of listed new-age tech startups have been allotting equity shares to employees under their ESOP plans. On Tuesday, Mamaearth parent  Honasa  approved the allotment of 5,79,849 equity shares  to its employees under its ESOP plans. Last week, foodtech giant Zomato allotted 38.72 Lakh equity shares. Prior to that, Nykaa allotted 1.73 Lakh equity shares. The latest development comes at a time when Paytm continues to reel under the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s regulatory crackdown on Paytm Payments Bank. Following the central bank\u2019s action, the fintech giant has seen deterioration in its financials. Paytm\u2019s  net loss more than doubled to INR 840.1 Cr in Q1 FY25  from  INR 358.4 Cr in the year-ago quarter. Revenue from operations also declined 36% to INR 1,502 Cr in Q1 FY25 from INR 2,342 Cr in\u00a0 Q1 FY24. Recently, Paytm sold its  entertainment and ticketing business  to Zomato for INR 2,048 Cr  to focus on its core payments and financial services distribution business.\u00a0 Meanwhile, in a relief, Paytm also secured the government\u2019s approval for its investment in its payments arm, Paytm Payment Services Limited. This will pave the way for the company to apply for a payment aggregator licence. Shares of Paytm ended today\u2019s trading session 3.11% higher at INR 614.10 on the BSE.",

        "Article Content": "Fintech giant  Paytm  is fully committed to integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in its core payment business, founder and chief executive Vijay Shekhar Sharma said. At the company\u2019s 24th annual general meeting, Sharma said that Paytm is leveraging AI to develop new technologies, and has already integrated the technology across all its business segments. \u201cSome technologies being built are so good, if you fork it out, it could become a standalone business vertical,\u201d Sharma said. However, at the moment, Paytm will focus on its core payment business and cross-selling financial services, as the company seeks to become profitable, Sharma added. The Paytm chief also predicted that AI will significantly impact every industry and early adopters will have the first mover advantage. Sharma said that in the next five years, India will be a leader in financial technology and will have the obligation to lead the AI technology. On that note, he also acknowledged that there is a demand and forward-looking expectation on Paytm to be able to bring an AI-powered risk management committee. \u201cRisk management options, credit risk, fraud risk, future underwriting of insurance will all be led by AI. The generative AI interaction with financial services will be underwriting,\u201d he said in the meeting. This meeting was held a month after the company reported its  first quarter  results.

The company, as per reports, shrinked its  employee headcount  by around 5,000 to 6,300, or around 15-20% of the total workforce to save costs of INR 400-500 Cr, earlier this year. Prior to that, Paytm  laid off  employees from some departments by as much as 20%, as part of its annual performance review, in March. In March, too, there were reports which said Paytm had directed \u201csome departments\u2026 to reduce their team size by as much as 20%.\u201d\u00a0 Sharma highlighted that costs have been saved so far through various measures, and the company is planning to further cut costs with the help of AI. The company is paying many cloud service providers and third party service providers to boost the enterprise softwares. The company has seen multiple leadership exits through the year, and Sharma  took charge  of Paytm in the month of May, amid a major restructuring move at the fintech giant. On the grounds of the company\u2019s leadership, he said that the senior leadership team is expanding in areas core to payment and financial services, which can be anticipated in the coming quarters. The shares of the fintech juggernaut stood at INR 659.20 on the BSE as of 01:06 PM in the intraday trading today (September 12), marking a 1.2% decline compared to the previous close of INR 667.",

        "Article Content": "Fintech major  Cred  announced on Thursday (September 12) that it has secured three critical security and data privacy certifications from the ISO(International Organisation for Standardisation).\u00a0 These three certifications include ISO 27001, ISO 27701:2019, and PCI DSS v4.0. In a statement, the startup said that these certifications will help it in protecting member data, ensuring safer transactions, and empowering members with more control over  their personal information. \u201cThese certifications are not just about compliance\u2014they are about building trust with our members, partners, and regulators. As we align with evolving data protection regulations, we will continue to work closely with regulators to lead by example in the fintech industry,\u201d CRED\u2019s founder and CEO Kunal Shah said.\u00a0 ISO is a Switzerland-based organisation that develops international standards for exchange of goods and services. The ISO 27001 certification essentially means CRED follows international practices for information security management, while the ISO 27701:2019 certification is for meeting international standards for managing and protecting personal data. Finally, the PCI DSS v4.0 certification is awarded by the Payment Security Standards Council to companies that demonstrate their ability to meet a set of security standards for processing, storing, and transmitting credit card data. CRED claimed it is among a select group to have received these three certificates. The company has embraced a platform approach since late 2022 and added a slew of products to flesh out the super app strategy.\u00a0 Most recently, it launched a personal finance management product CRED Money and in the past year, it has added revenue streams from acquired stock trading platform Kuvera, CRED Store, payment aggregator, personal loans, insurance commissions and more, as highlighted in our recent in-depth look at the  CRED revenue stack .\u00a0 Cybersecurity is a major consideration for startups in general, but for fintech platforms in particular, in light of the cyber-attack on  crypto platform WazirX earlier this year . It led to WazirX users losing investments to the tune of $230 Mn, with the issue unlikely to be resolved any time soon.\u00a0 Over the past few years, there have been other examples, such as the data breach at  fintech platform Juspay  in early 2021, where the data of 10 Cr users was compromised. Or Mobikwik in the same year, a breach which is  said to have affected over 100 Mn users .\u00a0\u00a0 Incidentally, the central government unveiled a host of initiatives yesterday (September 11). These included a  central registry of cyber criminals , creation of cyber commandos, and\u00a0 investigation facility Samanvay.",

        "Article Content": "Jaipur-based fintech startup  Finova Capital  is reportedly in advanced stages of discussion to raise INR 800 Cr (around $95.3 Mn) from new and existing investors in a mix of primary capital infusion and secondary share sale. The round will be led by new investors Avataar Venture Partners, Madison India Capital and Belgium investment fund Sofina, with participation from existing investors, Moneycontrol reported, citing sources. Queries sent to Mohit Sahney, cofounder of Finova Capital, did not elicit any response till the time of publishing this article. Founded in 2015 by the husband-wife duo of Mohit Sahney and Sunita Sahney, Finova Capital is a non-banking financial company that offers MSME business loans and home loans (backed by immovable property), with a focus in semi urban and rural areas. The ticket size of these loans range from INR 3 Lakh to INR 25 Lakh. The company has a presence in 16 states, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Himachal Pradesh, with a branch network of over 400. Finova Capital last raised $65 Mn from Norwest Venture Partners, Maj Invest and Faering Capital in 2022. Prior to that, Finova  raised around INR 260 Cr  from existing investors Peak XV Partners (erstwhile Sequoia Capital India) and Faering Capital in 2020. Finova Capital posted a consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of INR 151.5 Cr in the financial year 2023-24 (FY24), up 71% from 88.4 Cr in the preceding fiscal year. Revenue from operations zoomed 59% to INR 529.3 Cr in FY24 from INR 332.6 Cr in FY23. This comes at a time when NBFCs, especially targeted at the under-served MSME sector, are attracting significant investor interest. For instance, in June, lending tech startup Aye Finance  raised a debt funding of INR 250 Cr  (around $30 Mn) from Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO. The same month, Arthan Finance also  raised INR 50 Cr in its Series B funding  round led by Incofin India Progress Fund. Last month, fintech startup FlexiLoans  secured a debt funding of INR 75 Cr  (around $9 Mn) from JM Financials through private placement of non-convertible debentures (NCDs). Recently, it was also reported that  InCred group CFO Vivek Bansal has quit  the fintech firm to float his own NBFC venture, Saarathi Finance. According to Inc42 analysis, the Indian lending tech market is poised to reach a market size of $1.3 Tn by 2030.\u00a0 \u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Non banking financial company (NBFC)  Flexiloans  has raised INR 290 Cr (around $34.5 Mn) as a part of its Series C funding round from a clutch of investors, including Accion, Maj Invest, Nuveen and Fundamentum. Cofounder Deepak Jain told Inc42 that the fresh infusion will help the NBFC to further fuel its growth, increase product stack and grow its businesses. He added that they are also looking to expand into the supply chain financing market, as well as partnerships with traditional corporate finance platforms, in terms of vendor and dealer financing. India being the epicentre of manufacturing, the potential of the supply chain is expected to undergo great transformation in the next five to ten years. The company is, thus, willing to bet on this favourable trend to expand its business, Jain said. Founded in 2016 by Deepak Jain, Ritesh Jain and Manish Lunia, FlexiLoans is an online lending platform that targets small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and other underserved segments to provide quick and flexible loans.\u00a0 So far, the fintech startup claims to have disbursed over INR 7,000 Cr in loans across over 2,100 towns and cities.\u00a0 In 2022, the digital lending company  raised  $90 Mn through a mix of equity and debt financing in its Series B funding round from investors such as Denmark-based MAJ Invest, UK-based Fasanara Capital, and others.\u00a0 Additionally, the Mumbai-based startup  secured  a debt funding of INR 75 Cr (around $9 Mn) from JM Financials Limited through issuance of non-convertible debentures (NCDs), in August. This development comes at a time when lending companies are raising capital fueled by the motive to aid MSMEs across the country. In the past three months\u2019 time, companies such as  Arthan Finance ,  Lendingkart ,  Aye Finance ,  Moneyboxx ,  Clix Capital  have raised capital from various investors with a common motive to boost their game in MSME lending among other goals. Meanwhile, two weeks ago, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) revealed its plans to soon launch a platform called \u2018 Unified Lending Interface \u2019, to offer credit to rural and small businesses, which will cater to large unmet demand for credit across various sectors, particularly for agricultural and MSME borrowers.",

        "Article Content": "The electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing in India is set to get a big push with the Centre reportedly considering expanding the scope of the upcoming FAME-III scheme with a proposed outlay of INR 11,000 Cr. The government sops under the third iteration of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicle (FAME) scheme will likely be extended to electric ambulances and police vehicles, CNBC-TV18 reported, citing government sources. The Centre is reportedly hopeful that extension of the FAME-III subsidy scheme to newer vehicle categories such as electric buses and three-wheelers will directly benefit the public. Further, the government is also considering additional sops for EV buyers who are willing to scrap their old internal combustion vehicles. However, a final decision is yet to be taken.\u00a0\u00a0 The Centre already provides benefits such as 5% GST and road tax exemptions for electric cars.\u00a0 This comes on the heels of the announcement by union minister H. D. Kumaraswamy that  the Centre will launch the FAME-III subsidy scheme within the next two months . Pertinent to note that FAME-II, the previous edition of the demand incentive scheme for EVs, expired in April. While the EV industry was waiting for the Centre to extend the policy or introduce the FAME-III scheme, the expectations did not materialise. However, the Ministry of Heavy Industries launched the INR 500 Cr Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) 2024 earlier this year. It is a stopgap scheme to incentivise the EV industry with demand subsidies before the launch of the FAME-III scheme. While the EMPS was expected to end in July, it has been extended till September end.\u00a0 The FAME-II underwent massive turmoil last year as nearly half a dozen electric scooter makers were found in violation of  the local sourcing norms  that had to met to claim incentives. Companies such as Hero Electric, Okinawa Autotech, Ampere EV, Revolt Motors, Benling India, Lohia Auto and AMO Mobility were slapped with fines of crores of rupees for the violations, which led to months of mudslinging among the government and industry players. Owing to subsidy cuts and uncertainty about the FAME scheme, Indian two-wheeler EV sales have been on the decline.  The total EV two-wheeler registrations fell to 88,473 units in August  from over 1.07 Lakh units registered in July, as per Vahan data. \u00a0",

        "Author Name": "Amandeep Kaur",
        "Author URL": "https://inc42.com/author/amandeep-kaur/",
        "Article Content": "In today\u2019s competitive job market, a strong Employee Value Proposition (EVP) is no longer a luxury; it\u2019s a necessity. Companies that excel in crafting and delivering a compelling EVP are not only able to attract top talent but also retain and engage their workforce more effectively.  However, merely having an EVP in place isn\u2019t enough\u2014organisations need to measure its effectiveness to ensure it\u2019s driving the intended outcomes.  Here\u2019s how companies can gauge the impact of their EVP, supported by industry figures, examples, and actionable metrics. Employee engagement and satisfaction surveys are among the most direct ways to assess the effectiveness of an EVP. By measuring how employees feel about their roles, the company culture, and overall satisfaction, companies can glean insights into whether their EVP resonates with the workforce. For instance, the tech giant Google, known for its strong EVP centered around innovation, growth, and well-being, frequently surveys its employees. According to Google\u2019s internal reports, they maintain an employee satisfaction rate of over 80%, significantly above the industry average. This high rate indicates that their EVP is not just well-crafted but also well-received. A key indicator of an EVP\u2019s success is employee retention. A well-implemented EVP should ideally result in lower turnover rates, as employees are more likely to stay when their needs and values align with those of the company. According to a study by the Society for  Human Resource Management  (SHRM), companies with a strong EVP experience a 69% lower turnover rate compared to those with a weaker or non-existent EVP. For example, Unilever, with its EVP focusing on sustainability, diversity, and career growth, reported a 20% reduction in turnover after revamping its EVP in 2019. The effectiveness of an EVP is also reflected in a company\u2019s ability to attract new talent. Key metrics include the time-to-hire, quality of hire, and offer acceptance rates. Companies with a strong EVP often see a reduction in time-to-hire and an increase in the quality of candidates. Take the case of Microsoft. After enhancing its EVP to emphasise inclusivity, innovation, and work-life balance, the company saw a 30% increase in offer acceptance rates in 2022. This shift not only made the hiring process more efficient but also ensured that Microsoft attracted candidates who were a strong cultural fit. Another way to measure EVP effectiveness is by assessing the company\u2019s employer brand strength. This can be done through external surveys, rankings, and social media sentiment analysis. A strong employer brand indicates that the company\u2019s EVP is not only resonating internally but also externally, attracting potential candidates. LinkedIn\u2019s Employer Brand Report 2023 revealed that companies with a strong EVP saw a 31% increase in job applications compared to those without. Companies like Salesforce, which frequently tops employer branding rankings, attribute their success to a clear and compelling EVP that emphasises innovation, equality, and customer success. The Employee  Net Promoter Score  (eNPS) is another powerful metric for measuring EVP effectiveness. It asks employees how likely they are to recommend their company as a place to work, providing a clear indication of employee satisfaction and loyalty. For instance, Netflix, known for its EVP centered around freedom and responsibility, regularly measures its eNPS. The company consistently scores above +60, which is considered world-class, indicating that its EVP resonates strongly with its employees. Finally, companies can correlate their EVP effectiveness with overall financial performance. Research by McKinsey shows that companies with strong EVPs outperform their peers by up to 20% in profitability. This is because a strong EVP not only attracts and retains talent but also enhances productivity and engagement, leading to better business outcomes. Measuring the effectiveness of EVP gives companies a competitive edge in the talent market By using a combination of engagement surveys, retention rates, talent acquisition metrics, employer brand strength, eNPS, and financial performance analysis, companies can gain a comprehensive understanding of how well their EVP is performing. In doing so, they can make data-driven decisions to refine and enhance their EVP, ensuring it continues to deliver value to both the company and its employees.",

        "Article Content": "Electric two-wheeler maker  Ather Energy  is reportedly looking to file its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) next week for an INR 4,500 Cr IPO in a mix of a fresh issue and offer for sale (OFS). The emobility unicorn is targeting a valuation of around $2.5 Bn for the IPO, Moneycontrol reported citing sources.\u00a0 The development comes on the heels of Ather\u2019s competitor Ola Electric going public by raising over INR 6,145.6 Cr in total. The Bhavish Aggarwal-led startup went public at a valuation of $4 Bn, which many market experts deemed quite high. In June, Ather\u2019s board also passed a resolution during its annual general meeting to convert the startup into a public company from private, starting the process for the company to list on the bourses.\u00a0 Ather joined the unicorn club recently after raising INR 600 Cr ($71 Mn)  from its existing investor National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) at a post-money valuation of\u00a0 $1.3 Bn. Prior to this, it raised debt funding of INR 60 Cr (around $7.1 Mn) via non-convertible debentures (NCDs) from InnoVen Capital. Pawan Munjal-led Hero MotoCorp is one of the leading investors in the startup, owning a 40.89% stake. Founded in 2013 by Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain, Ather Energy manufactures escooters and\u00a0 battery packs. It also operates its own charging infrastructure. After building its market on its 450 series of escooters, the startup recently launched a family escooter series Rizta and forayed into the smart helmet category. In June, Ather also announced setting up its third manufacturing facility in Maharashtra to manufacture escooters and battery packs. Recently, it expanded its business to Sri Lanka, marking its second overseas foray after Nepal. Currently, in terms of escooter sales, Ather is at the fourth position in the market, behind Ola Electric, TVS Motor, and Bajaj Auto. Ather\u2019s total vehicle registration in August stood at 10,873 units, growing almost 52% year-on-year (YoY). However, like Ola Electric, Ather also continues to be a loss-making entity. Its net loss widened 22.5% to INR 1,059.7 Cr in FY24, as per the annual report of Hero MotoCorp. It is pertinent to note that the much-anticipated IPO of  Ola Electric witnessed a muted market debut  last month. However, the shares are currently trading over 44% higher than their listing price.",

        "Article Content": "Run by Bengaluru-based Zinka Logistics Solutions, BlackBuck, an online marketplace for truckers and freight operators, is the latest to join the list of new-age tech startups preparing for public market entry in 2024. Backed by Peak XV, Accel, Tiger Global and other noted investors, the logistics unicorn recently  filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP)  with capital market regulator SEBI for an INR 550 Cr+ IPO.\u00a0 The issue will be a mix of new shares worth INR 550 Cr and an OFS (offer for sale) of up to 2.16 Cr shares from promoters and existing investors. The three cofounders of  BlackBuck  intend to offload 44.37 Lakh shares during the public market listing . The IPO aspirant aims to utilise the proceeds to strengthen its sales and marketing initiatives and grow its NBFC subsidiary, BlackBuck Finserve.\u00a0 As many as six new-age tech startups have listed in the current calendar year \u2013 four on the mainboard and two on the SME platform \u2013 raising over INR 5,598 Cr ($670 Mn). In all cases, shares exceeded the initial pricing range, highlighting the typical rush for IPOs in the Indian stock market. It also gives us a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, bringing back to mind the 2021 startup IPO market, although with a few twists and turns, including smaller IPO sizes and more reasonable valuations.\u00a0 Lately, IPOs in India have become more attractive with heavy retail participation, and several companies have been listed at a premium. Per a  Fortune India   report , 70% of the 30 main-board IPOs were listed at a premium, followed by 72% (out of 54 IPOs) in FY22 and 67% (out of 37 IPOs) in FY23. Interestingly, in the first nine months of FY24, 78% of the 54 main-board IPOs were listed at a premium. Ola Electric, Swiggy, FirstCry and Unicommerce are among the most-awaited IPOs of the year, but these are still at various stages of preparation. A few others, like BlackBuck and  Avanse Financial Services , are out with their DRHPs without any prior hint. Before we weigh in the potential risks and rewards of the BlackBuck IPO, it will be pertinent to look at the company\u2019s operations and how its business model stacks up against the country\u2019s leading logistics players.\u00a0 Founded in 2015 by IIT Kharagpur alumni Rajesh Yabaji and Chanakya Hridaya, along with Rama Subramaniam, the B2B marketplace specialises in inter-city full truckload (FTL) transportation. In simple terms, it seamlessly connects  truck operators with small and big businesses with shipping requirements in real time via its tech-enabled platform and operates pan-India .\u00a0 Although BlackBuck started as a truck aggregator, it currently provides a comprehensive range of solutions for load management, telematics, payment (fuel and FASTag or toll charges) and vehicle financing (with a focus on trucks).\u00a0 It has an asset-light business model and generates revenue through platform fees, subscriptions and commissions (more on its business fundamentals later). The startup has raised over $360 Mn in funding and directly competes with Wheelseye, Vahak and FleetX Loconav, digital freight platforms catering to truckers in India.\u00a0 BlackBuck says it is the largest digital freight platform for truckers in terms of revenue, accounting for  27% of the domestic market share.  India\u2019s road freight transport market , estimated at $140.3 Bn in 2024, is expected to reach $236.3 Bn by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.08% during the forecast period.\u00a0 As road transportation, especially trucking, continues to grow due to increased economic activities and improved infrastructure, ventures like BlackBuck will likely witness exponential growth as a core component of India\u2019s booming logistics industry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The startup also claims to service the maximum number of truck operators. In FY24, it had 9.6 Lakh transacting users on the platform, accounting for 27.52% of the truckers in India, it said.\u00a0 Over the years, many Indian logistics companies, including Blue Dart Express, Allcargo Gati, VRL Logistics and Delhivery, have taken the IPO route to grow their capital base and expand their business. Although part of their operations covers the FTL market, where BlackBuck is a specialist, the latter  is the first to go ahead with a unique value proposition \u2013 providing a digital edge to the highly fragmented road freight transportation space. Speaking to Inc42, an analyst at a brokerage firm said it could be a bit early to discuss BlackBuck\u2019s IPO prospects, given the pending SEBI nod. However, it has a more \u2018mature\u2019 business model and stands out from the rest of its listed and unlisted peers in the trucking/logistics market. There is a catch, though, the analyst pointed out, requesting not to be named. \u201cBlackBuck is a B2B tech company helping truckers leverage the on-demand economy and shaping the future of freight. Considering its multi-pronged approach, this narrative is a bit more complicated than Zomato or Nykaa, the [B2C] platforms people used regularly and understood their businesses better. In this case, investors may require more time to comprehend the entire business model or the long-term value proposition. But as I have said, it is too early to gauge the market sentiment,\u201d he explained.\u00a0 Meanwhile, BlackBuck\u2019s profitability at the operating level positions the company well for the public markets, the analyst added. As per its DRHP, BlackBuck was a loss-making entity and  reported INR 194 Cr in net losses in FY24 . But compared to the previous financial year, this was a 33% drop from the INR 290.4 Cr loss posted in FY23, marking a significant improvement.\u00a0\u00a0 Meanwhile, it turned profitable at an operating level in FY24 with an adjusted EBITDA of INR 13.3 Cr against a loss of INR 154.5 Cr in FY23.\u00a0\u00a0 The startup said its adjusted EBITDA showed restated loss before tax from continuing operations, adjusted for finance costs, depreciation and amortisation expenses, employee share-based payment expenses and other net gains/losses. Its other net gains/losses amounted to nought in the reported year. BlackBuck\u2019s EBITDA loss stood at INR 138.8 Cr in FY24, but its operating revenue jumped 69% YoY to INR 296.9 Cr during that year.\u00a0 A close look at the startup\u2019s revenue channels and its parent company\u2019s business commitments will further clarify how the venture is faring overall. BlackBuck generates revenue from its payment solutions for toll taxes and fuel charges, deployment of telematics (remote monitoring of vehicles) data to truck owners, vehicle financing and other service fees.\u00a0 A significant portion of its operating revenue comes from commissions (incomes from banks and oil marketing companies for the distribution and management of FASTags and fuel cards, respectively) and subscriptions for telematics-based fleet management and platform services. Its overall revenue from trucking services stood at INR 296.1 Cr in FY24, growing nearly 69% YoY. Its parent entity, Zinka Logistics, runs other subsidiaries, including TZF Logistics Solutions, BlackBuck Finserve, ZZ Logistics Solutions and BlackBuck Netherlands B.V.\u00a0 Among these, BlackBuck Finserve received its non-deposit-taking NBFC licence on August 1, 2023, and commenced lending in October last year. It provides financing solutions for various assets such as plants and machinery and vehicles like buses and trucks. In its DRHP, BlackBuck states that the vehicle financing business (backed by BFPL and its finance partners) enables truck operators to buy used commercial vehicles or get financing on existing ones. With this model in place, the startup generates revenues from interest incomes and loan processing fees. The logistics major is too keen to pursue this revenue channel, as its draft filing reveals.\u00a0 As per its DRHP, the net proceeds invested in the NBFC subsidiary will be used to finance the augmentation of its capital base to meet its future capital requirements and not towards further acquisitions or repayments of its existing loans. This approach is understandable since Indian think tank NITI Aayog estimates that the number of trucks on Indian roads will quadruple, from   4 Mn in 2022 to 17 Mn by 2050 . With the concept of  Vikshit Bharat  set to culminate by 2047 and fuel India\u2019s economic growth, the country\u2019s core development areas, like manufacturing and supply chain logistics, are set to gain unprecedented momentum. This will throw open new growth opportunities for ventures like BlackBuck looking to finance different asset types, from infrastructural facilities and components to road freight essentials. As of March 31, 2024, the NBFC arm disbursed 4,035 loans totalling INR 196.8 Cr. The interest income contributed around 0.23% to BlackBuck\u2019s total consolidated revenue from operations in FY24. The finance and payments businesses contributed 45.26% to the startup\u2019s consolidated operating revenue in FY24. On the flip side, BlackBuck noted in its DRHP that any regulatory changes in the payment ecosystem or electronic toll collection technologies, among a few other global policy-related shifts, could have a material adverse effect on its payments and telematics business, which contributed to more than 94% to its consolidated operating revenue in FY24.\u00a0 Supported by a clutch of marquee investors such as Peak XV, Tiger Global, Tribe Capital, IFC Emerging\u00a0 Asia Fund, VEF, Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and Accel,  BlackBuck emerged as a unicorn in 2021 . After building a strong foothold in the trucking and logistics industry for nine years and undergoing bumpy rides to achieve a billion-dollar valuation, BlackBuck is finally ready to leap forward and go public when several other prominent household names are also on track for an IPO. But more than the tussle for market attention, BlackBuck needs to get its house in order. The startup has civil, tax and criminal proceedings against the company, its promoters and its directors worth INR 277.2 Cr. Among these, one litigation worth INR 275.8 Cr involves a company director. Still, what matters most is the ultimate litmus test. A blessing of tech unicorns is leaning towards initial public offerings now that private capital has grown scarce due to a harsh funding winter. Capital market investors, on the other hand, are genuinely excited to see high-growth startups making their debut. However, profit remains the prerequisite for success in today\u2019s market scenario, and people can soon pull their money out without solid business outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Edited by Sanghamitra Mandal]",

        "Article Content": "Ride-hailing startup  Rapido  has bagged a funding of $120 Mn (about INR 1,000 Cr) from existing investor WestBridge Capital at a post-money valuation of a little over $1 Bn. The investor poured in the fresh capital by participating in Rapido\u2019s Series E funding round through three of its related entities \u2013 Setu AIF Trust, Konark Trust, and MMPL Trust, as per regulatory filings. Rapido\u2019s parent entity Roppen Transportation Services Pvt Ltd allotted 95,479\u00a0 Series E compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS) and 95,489 Series E1 CCPS to the three WestBridge Capital entities on July 18.

        "Author Name": "Bismah Malik",
        "Author URL": "https://inc42.com/author/bismah-malik/",
        "Article Content": "The  Zomato and  Paytm  Insider deal  is definitely one of the most high profile acquisitions in India. But the question that many are asking is: did Zomato overvalue Paytm Insider in the INR 2,048 Cr deal. Zomato and its CEO Deepinder Goyal have been in this situation before, and had to answer a similar question two years ago.\u00a0 In 2022, when Zomato and CEO Deepinder Goyal decided to spend roughly $568 Mn (INR 4,447 Cr) to  acquire quick commerce platform Blinkit , many were left scratching their heads as to whether this is the  right valuation  for Blinkit which had just pivoted to quick commerce after years of operating Grofers in a hyperlocal model.\u00a0 There were plenty of questions about the rationale behind the deal, particularly a year after Zomato\u2019s public listing, and with pressure to turn profitable. Would acquiring and growing Blinkit disrupt Zomato\u2019s path to profitability, analysts wondered.\u00a0 As it turns out, Zomato got its share of the quick commerce boom for a bargain. Today, Blinkit\u2019s valuation is estimated to be close to INR 1 Lakh Cr or just over $12 Bn. The quick commerce app has the largest presence in India with over 630 dark stores around the country, and a major presence in key metros.\u00a0 Blinkit brought in  over INR 2,000 Cr for Zomato in FY24 , and doubled the revenue on a YoY basis in the last quarter (Q2 FY25), so it is on pace to make Zomato\u2019s acquisition price look like a drop in a bucket.\u00a0 But assuming that Zomato and Goyal will pull this off again is a fallacy. The factors that worked for quick commerce cannot be applied to movie and events ticketing.\u00a0 The transaction size of 2,048 Cr is 6 to 7 times the revenue that Paytm Insider reported in FY24. Many industry watchers are shocked to see the rich valuation for a player that is a distant second to BookMyShow. So has Zomato overpaid for Paytm Insider?\u00a0 Multiple analysts and those in the events industry believe that Zomato\u2019s valuation is overpriced by as much as 60%.\u00a0 As per industry benchmarks and Paytm Insider\u2019s revenue trajectory, the price should have been in the INR 700 Cr-INR 800 Cr range, given the FY24 revenue of INR 297 Cr and EBITDA of INR 29 Cr.\u00a0 Karan Taurani, SVP at Elara Capital, who closely watches the media and consumer tech market believes that Paytm Insider was certainly given a premium with regards to the valuation, but he also noted that Zomato\u2019s history of turning around businesses can actually deliver good ROI for the group in the medium to long term.\u00a0 \u201cA lot depends on Zomato\u2019s execution strategy and its track record of handling incumbent players which can fetch the company sizable returns in the long term,\u201d Taurani added.\u00a0\u00a0 Nishant Kini, founder of Bengaluru-based branding and events agency The Nish\u00e9 & Co, added that the price seems particularly high considering Paytm Insider had a stronger presence in Tier 1, 2 towns. On the other hand, Zomato\u2019s plan to add Paytm Insider to its District going-out vertical seems to be centred around metros.\u00a0 Going-out is the next big thing for Goyal. He wants to bring the same tech-led aggregation and feature set that has created Zomato and Blinkit to this relatively underserved space.\u00a0 The thesis is built around the fact that Zomato\u2019s core base of millennials and Generation Z Indians has overlapped with the target audience for quick commerce and going out. However, Paytm Insider\u2019s business is built around ticketing, which is a subset of the going-out vertical for Zomato. In this light, Zomato\u2019s valuation for Paytm Insider seems even richer.\u00a0 Then there\u2019s BookMyShow, a cash-rich company with nearly 20 years of experience in the movie and events ticketing business and a separate event management vertical as well. The Reliance-backed startup is also profitable, and has been in the news for a  potential $300 Mn infusion by KKR . Reliance Industries, with 37% stake in BookMyShow, is a significant advantage for the company, particularly after the inception of the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre (NMACC) in Mumbai in 2023, which has become the destination for large international cultural shows and performances, including some high-profile musicals.\u00a0 The company also has exclusive ticketing rights for large events that are owned and managed by its in-house team such as Lollapalooza India.\u00a0 Will Zomato dive into managing and owning live event properties?\u00a0 It\u2019s as if the pandemic touched a raw nerve \u2014 Indians have increased discretionary spending on outdoor media and entertainment with great enthusiasm. Rising per capita income in the metros has led to a significant growth in spending on ticketed events, with all categories \u2014 music concerts, comedy performances, sports and other live events \u2014 growing in 2023.\u00a0 This is in line with the growth trends seen since early 2022, however, movie ticketing has not grown as significantly.\u00a0 For instance, PVR-INOX, one of the largest multiplex operators in India, saw revenue from sales fall to INR 594 Cr in the April-June quarter of FY25, compared to INR 695 Cr one year ago.\u00a0 This is why despite movie ticketing almost constituting a 70% of its annual revenue base, BookMyShow has invested millions into exclusive international events such as the Sunburn Festival and Lollapalooza India.\u00a0 One source privy to the events operations at BMS said that the company bought exclusive rights to host Sunburn Festival for Hundreds of Crores a few years ago, and this has mostly been a profitable investment.\u00a0 In addition, BMS also invested an undisclosed sum to buy the India rights for the legendary international music festival Lollapalooza, which it aims to take to breakeven by next year. The first two editions of Lollapalooza India give us an indication of why BMS has invested millions in this vertical.\u00a0 BookMyShow retains the entire consideration paid by visitors to Lollapalooza India and other festivals, with ticket prices ranging from INR 5,000 to INR 25,000 in some cases. Besides this, BMS earns revenue from exhibitors and merchants at these festivals\u00a0 The return of mega events can be attributed to the revenge spending trends seen in travel and retail shopping, which have reversed the lower consumer spending for these areas during the pandemic years. Sports events constitute more than 80% of the event ticketing market, and therefore this will be a major focus for Zomato in addition to movie ticketing.\u00a0 A March 2024  EY-FICCI repor t claims the live events and ticketing business in India grew by 20% in 2023 to reach a market size of INR 8,800 Cr and is expected to touch INR 14,700 Cr by 2026.\u00a0 \u201cThe proliferation of online ticketing platforms has made it easier for consumers to discover, purchase, and attend events and has aided in event marketing to create increased awareness,\u201d the EY-FICCI report added. Organising and owning large scale event IPs has its risks as well. While the revenue upside is clear, BookMyShow has to bear full losses for event cancellations due to any reason.\u00a0 For example: in September last year, BookMyShow came under fire after standup comic Trevor Noah\u2019s shows in Bengaluru were cancelled. In this case, BMS was criticised for haphazardly cancelling the show and also not maintaining the high production value standards required for such events.  \u201cWe tried everything but because the audience can\u2019t hear the comedians on stage there\u2019s literally no way to do a show,\u201d Noah tweeted about the reason for the cancellation.\u00a0 This shows that producing events is not a matter of will, but comes down to execution and the details. This is also why these events are typically in a higher price bracket than events where the platform is only selling tickets.\u00a0 \u201cMovie ticketing has seen a slump in the wake of OTT entertainment, but live event ticket pricing has surged, and this does pose a challenge in attracting users beyond the affluent class. Hence platforms are looking to buy out large scale events knowing exactly what kind of consumer to attract,\u201d added The Nish\u00e9 & Co\u2019s Kini. Sources told Inc42 that BookMyShow is looking to consolidate revenue from live events. It is looking to sign deals with artists, comedians, musicians to create a pipeline of live events where it can maximise revenue collection.\u00a0 Zomato is also likely to focus on music festivals, especially targeting international artists, with its upcoming Dua Lipa concert for Feeding India being a prime example. The company does have some experience with its Zomaland carnival organised in several Indian cities, but there is no doubt that Zomato will have to invest in building new live properties and a steady stream of events to justify the high price it is paying for Paytm Insider.\u00a0\u00a0 Paytm Insider does not have event IP expertise as it has only been a ticketing player and has not gone into event operations and management.\u00a0 \u201cMuch will depend on how the two entities are brought together and the users on Paytm and Zomato given some over the top discounts on highly priced tickets to these big events which could get them a breakthrough,\u201d the founder of an event management company told us.\u00a0 However, there\u2019s no denying that Zomato has the base and the track record of executing the right things to achieve growth.\u00a0 As Elara\u2019s Taurani added, \u201cGoing out businesses have reported healthy margins in the recent past. This gives a strategic boost to Zomato, which already has a large consumer base of young people on its apps who could ultimately be convinced to buy tickets online.\u201d Him and others clarified that there is no short-term threat to BookMyShow in terms of market share in movie ticket booking and the live events verticals. One thing Zomato is trying to do is to differentiate itself in terms of user experience.\u00a0 For instance, the Dua Lipa concert has a \u2018Buy and Sell Later\u2019 option that lets users resell their ticket in case their plans change. This is perhaps the first such feature for a ticketing platform in India. It shows that Zomato is not afraid to take risks to attract users.\u00a0 Another factor that could work in Zomato\u2019s favour is its pull with Industry players, particularly F&B brands that are a key part of the live events space. Zomato has also curried the favour of several high-profile celebrities through endorsements in the past few years, which can also work to boost the live events business in the short to medium term.\u00a0 Plus, event sponsors, brands and organisers have been looking for an alternative to BookMyShow which wields considerable power in negotiations on commissions and pricing. While BookMyShow is ahead for now, Zomato can gain some ground in the early days by looking to break this \u2018monopoly\u2019.\u00a0 Edited By Nikhil Subramaniam",

        "Article Content": "Women-focused wellness startup Newmi Care has raised $1.5 Mn (about INR 12.6 Cr) in a seed funding round led by Sprout Venture Partners. The round also saw participation from a family office, LetsVenture, Sarcha Advisors, Key Ventures Forum and a host of angel investors. The company plans to use the fresh capital to build its women clinics in northern and western pockets of India, while also strengthening technology and product innovation and team expansion. Founded in May 2022 by Sanchit Agarwal and Aditi Mittal, Newmi Care provides medical care options for women, aside from which it also sells wellness products like PCOS tea, supplements, menstrual cups, maternity clothing and more. The company claims to have rendered its services to over 60,000 women across more than 400 cities in India covering health concerns ranging from menstrual, sexual and hormonal health, fertility and maternity, menopause and women reproductive organ cancers. \u201cWe are on a mission to simplify outpatient care for women in India and bring women health to forefront. This capital infusion is a step to move closer to our path to solve for women health at scale in India,\u201d Agarwal said. The development comes at a time when digital wellness startups have begun to gain funds to expand their product portfolio and services. For instance, last month, Gurugram-based femtech startup Laiqa Wellness  secured  INR 15 Cr ($ 1.8 Mn) in its seed funding round from IvyCap Ventures. In July, D2C wellness brand Hoop  raised an undisclosed amount  from Olympian PV Sindhu.  Hoop was a part of Peak XV Partners\u2019 (erstwhile Sequoia India and Southeast Asia) second cohort of the  Sequoia Spark fellowship programme . Updated at 03:41 PM",

        "Article Content": "Bengaluru-based healthtech startup  Medibuddy  is raising $8.4 Mn (about INR 70 Cr) debt funding from existing debt investors, including Innoven Capital and Alteria Capital, Inc42 has learnt. Confirming the development, the startup told Inc42 that the funds would be used for sustained growth and potential acquisitions.\u00a0 \u201cMediBuddy is strategically raising INR 70 Cr in debt from our trusted existing debt partners. Our core business remains financially robust and does not require immediate capital, this initiative is a vital component of our comprehensive business strategy to further fuel expansion,\u201d a MediBuddy spokesperson said in a statement.\u00a0 The spokesperson added that the debt funding will enhance its cash reserves for new strategic priorities.\u00a0 MediBuddy also claimed in the statement that it  closed FY24 with a marginal loss and approached EBITDA neutrality. Now, it is focussed on acquiring companies within key healthcare sectors, including women\u2019s health, mental health, diabetes, and chronic disease management.\u00a0 \u201c\u2026  To enhance our cash reserves for new strategic priorities, we are undertaking this debt raise, which is non-dilutive to our equity\u2026 This infusion of capital will enable us to continue investing in innovative healthcare solutions, expanding our reach, and enhancing the quality of our services,\u201d the statement added. The fresh debt infusion comes almost nine months after the  startup bagged $18 Mn from its existing investors , including Qadaria Capital, Lightrock, and TEAMFund, for expansion and strategic acquisitions.\u00a0 Founded in 2015 by Satish Kannan and Enbasekar Dinadayalane, MediBuddy offers doctor video consultations, end-to-end surgery care, online lab test booking and medicine ordering services. Besides this, the startup also offers insurance solutions with the help of Medi Assist. MediBuddy claims to have a network of over 90,000 doctors, 7,000 hospitals, 3,000 diagnostic centres, and 2,500 pharmacies, covering almost 96% of Indian pin codes. The startup currently claims to have a customer base of over 3 Cr.\u00a0 With the latest fundraise, the startup\u2019s combined equity and debt funding would  increase to about $218 Mn . The soonicorn startup counts the likes of Bessemer Venture Partners, India Life Sciences Fund III, Rebright Partners, JAFCO Asia, and TEAMFUND LP among its backers.\u00a0 MediBuddy directly competes against the likes of Tata-owned 1mg, Practo, and Reliance-owned Netmeds in the burgeoning Indian market.\u00a0 Telemedicine startups saw a stupendous increase in demand with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. On the back of this, a number of healthtech startups raised capital to expand their offerings and infrastructure. However, these startups saw a sharp decline in their user base after the pandemic subsided, resulting in many healthtech startups shutting down. Manipal Group-backed Phable, and MojoCare were among the startups which shut operations.\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "When we looked at the  state of exits for venture capital funds  in India last week, several fund managers \u2014 former and active \u2014 texted me about how many of these funds on the exit path are acting out of desperation. To add context, my sources pointed to SEBI\u2019s changes released in April around the one-year extension for funds to begin their liquidation process. The extension itself is not a new development, as funds have typically received a 1+1 year extension for some time now. However, SEBI  also changed its rules related to liquidation  in April this year after several limited partners approached the regulator about funds delaying fund closures beyond these extensions. Before we get to these rules, it\u2019s important to understand that all AIF schemes in India or venture capital funds in common parlance have a fixed tenure. This depends on the fund itself and what kind of exit horizon it has set for its limited partners i.e. the investors that infuse the capital which is eventually invested in startups. Some LPs want to invest in short horizon funds that commit to returning the capital and a profit in five to six years, but on average AIF schemes have a tenure of seven years. Over and above this, there is an extension from SEBI to close the fund. So a fund or AIF scheme that was announced in 2015 is more or less nearing its expiration in 2024 and 2025. In recent times, SEBI has stepped up its scrutiny of AIFs that are seeking to extend tenures, because in many cases these funds were simply buying time and did not have a plan to liquidate their funds. Given the explosion of startups in the years following 2015, we can surmise that plenty of AIFs are currently either in their liquidation period or have already exhausted the extension from SEBI. Many of these funds are some of the oldest in the country and were set up between 2015 and 2017, at a time when startups were just emerging as an asset class. This vintage of AIFs has seen plenty of upheaval too with the global economic slowdown in 2018 as well as the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. But through these cycles, the likes of  Orios VP ,  IndiaQuotient , Kalaari Capital,  Chiratae (formerly IDG) , Blume and other VCs have closed funds and returned capital to investors. These and other noted VCs from the Indian ecosystem will be close to their fund expiry dates in 2025 and 2026 as well. And as such SEBI\u2019s rules for liquidation are most applicable for these funds, as well as their LPs and portfolio companies. In this context, the liquidation period refers to the one-year period following the completion of an AIF\u2019s tenure, during which the fund manager has to liquidate all the fund\u2019s unliquidated assets and distribute the proceeds to limited partners. This is followed by a dissolution period and this can be opted by funds to deal with unliquidated investments, as long as there is LP consent. This is undoubtedly one of the most challenging positions for a VC fund, where it has to look for buyers for assets that may not be all that attractive for the market even at a discount. In the past, SEBI had allowed funds the flexibility to roll over unliquidated assets to a new scheme or fund, but this was not a route that limited partners were happy about. LPs would not only have to bear the risk of the asset remaining unattractive even under a separate AIF scheme, but also would have to bear tax expenses out-of-pocket with no other recourse under tax and foreign exchange laws. This option has been rescinded because of the tax implications for LPs and the fact that AIFs can exploit this loophole to keep limited partners on the hook for their returns. The other option, i.e. pro-rata distribution of the asset to limited partners, was also a no-go as this would put private companies in a tricky position regulation wise. Pro-rata distribution also known as in-kind distribution means LPs will get equivalent securities to avoid capital gains tax on liquidated holdings. LPs will have access to all information on the available bids prior to choosing between an in-kind distribution or a dissolution period, during which the assets will be opened for bids to the open market. As per the Companies Act, 2013, a private unlisted company cannot have more than 200 shareholders and the number of LPs in any fund can go as high as 150. If each fund allocated shares from unliquidated assets to individual LPs, then the company would have to convert into a public limited company, which is simply not possible for most of the startups. Given these challenges, SEBI brought in the new rules earlier this year, which give AIFs some leeway and flexibility in terms of closing their funds and giving returns to LPs. As we were told by a number of fund managers, closing a fund at one time was a major headache, but the new rules do make it simpler for VCs to manage this process if not get the best outcomes. Under this, AIFs can avail a dissolution period with the consent of 75% of its LPs by the value of their investment in the scheme being liquidated. Such consent has to be sought only during the AIF\u2019s liquidation period and cannot be secured ahead of time. This consent procedure mandates that AIF managers obtain bids, on a consolidated basis for all unliquidated assets of the AIF, from the market and offer proportionate exits to investors who do not wish to continue under the dissolution period. If an AIF manager is unable to obtain bids from the market but has obtained the 75% consent of its LPs, then the dissolution period can still go ahead. But as a penalty, such fund managers are required to report their performance to benchmarking agencies, with unliquidated assets to be reported at a value equivalent to INR 1, regardless of finally realised value. This move by itself does not devalue the asset but is seen as a benchmarking exercise that can be used to certify and rate fund managers in the future. This is a crucial exercise to be seen along with the NISM certification requirement, which we wrote about last month. With these two barometers \u2014 the certification to operate a fund and the benchmarking to map its performance \u2014 SEBI is making it extremely clear that it will not accept fly-by-night AIF operations or funds that are falling foul of their responsibility in terms of due diligence and portfolio governance. That\u2019s been one of the key concerns raised by limited partners in the past two years. Besides clarifying some of the rules pertaining to liquidation and dissolution of funds, SEBI has sought information reporting from AIFs that want to avail of the year-long extension to initiate liquidation. AIF managers need to submit details of the AIF, the unliquidated portfolio and its value, and pending investor complaints. Those AIFs entering into a dissolution period after the liquidation period are required to file an information memorandum with SEBI, accompanied by a due diligence certificate from a merchant banker. SEBI\u2019s requirements do increase the potential compliance burden for VC funds, but fund managers have welcomed these rules, especially given the reputational damage to some VCs in light of the value erosion in their portfolios. However, in practice, most AIFs in India have not yet adopted the new regulations since they are so new, and as per experienced fund managers that we spoke to, there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty about how this might play out in the long run. \u201cNobody knows whether the new regulations are better for funds because they are new to everyone. Even experienced fund managers don\u2019t yet know whether the new regulations are better since the adoption is ongoing,\u201d according to a veteran fund manager who has invested in startups through AIFs since 2013. The fund manager quoted above closed their first fund in 2021-22 after availing the 1+1 year extension offered by SEBI. That particular fund delivered 5X-6X returns for LPs, an outcome that funds today might welcome with open arms. On the flip side, some startup founders might find themselves at the wrong end of secondary deal structures as funds push to get bids for unliquidated assets. As per one Bengaluru-based early stage and growth stage AIF founder, even in good times and at the peak of market liquidity during the pandemic, the discount for secondaries was 10% on average. In the run-up to 2021, for instance, we saw several secondary deals led by PE funds as half a dozen startups lined up for IPOs, including the likes of Paytm and Zomato. It\u2019s possible that many of these institutional funds were nearing end of life in 2021. Plus, in July 2021, Tiger Global, Matrix Partners (now known as Z47) and others sold some of their stake in Ola Cabs parent ANI Technologies to Temasek and Warburg Pincus for $500 Mn. This is  one of the biggest secondary deals  in the Indian startup ecosystem, which also gave an exit to some investors who had backed startups acquired by Ola such as TaxiForSure. For the above Ola example, Matrix launched its \u2018Matrix Partners India II\u2019 fund in 2011, and it invested in the likes of Ola and OfBusiness through this second fund. According to Pitchbook, the fund has been closed, and it was very likely up for liquidation by 2022. Besides Ola, Matrix saw a partial exit from OfBusiness via a secondary sale to Alpha Wave and Tiger Global in 2022. Some of those secondaries in 2021 came at a discount even though the market had high liquidity, and now, with the future uncertain, those in the market for secondaries in 2024 enjoy the advantage of getting an even bigger discount. \u201cIn the VC world, this discount is called the liquidity discount. Even in good times when the market is pretty good, it is generally considered to be 10%. If the asset does not have super demand, the secondary buyer will always get a discount and this depends on the asset.\u201d Prominent examples of discounted secondaries in 2024 include the likes of  SoftBank-backed Eruditus , Insight Partners-backed  Postman , and SaaS startup  MoEngage , among others. Bengaluru-based ecommerce unicorn Meesho is also reportedly in talks for  a primary infusion and secondary deal at a discount of 20% . But for every unicorn and scaled up startup, there are assets that have seen deep value erosion. Offloading these assets or finding bids for them in the open market might become a steep uphill battle for inexperienced fund managers and even some experienced ones. Like 2021, and to some extent 2022, this is a great year for secondaries but largely for buyers. For VCs, there is a feeling of being resigned to heavy discounting. \u201cThere is no doubt that this is a buyer\u2019s market. Many VCs are desperate to exit their funds and show some positive track record in terms of LP returns. For many of the professional fund managers, this is a litmus test and therefore some of them might pressurise founders to execute deals quickly,\u201d the VC firm founder quoted above added. Fund managers are more than happy to enter secondaries as it creates a positive track record as far as their performance is concerned. SEBI\u2019s streamlined process penalises the AIF managers for failing to liquidate an AIF\u2019s investments within its original or extended tenure, given the mandate on performance reporting. As a result, many fund managers are likely to be in the midst of discussions for secondary transactions and structures are being planned in light of some of these deals happening in IPO-bound companies. On the founder side, there are concerns about increased due diligence burden as well as potential mismatch in terms of the expectations of the incoming investors and the business trajectory. But these points of friction are part of building a startup with VC money. \u201cFounders have to accept that if there was a time for primary rounds and capital infusion, it will be followed by a time for secondaries and exits. This is part and parcel of venture investing, and there is no doubt that some founders may feel shortchanged, but that\u2019s the reality they have to accept,\u201d said a third Bengaluru-based fund manager. In fact, according to this individual, founders who pose hurdles to their shareholders in terms of secondaries are doing a disservice to the ecosystem and risk being blacklisted by VCs in the future. There\u2019s undoubtedly bound to be some friction though. Despite SEBI\u2019s regulations and clarity on the liquidation path, there are practical challenges in going through this process. Plus, the introduction of performance reporting for AIF managers at the end of a fund\u2019s lifecycle means for the first time many VCs and their track record will be out in the open. VC industry insiders believe this had to happen because SEBI is looking at private market investments through the same lens as it does public markets. The regulator\u2019s focus has clearly been on cleaning up the fluff from the frothy AIF market, but these regulations have second and third-order impacts. Founders might soon find themselves with investors that don\u2019t fit their vision, while funds might have to settle for discounts even for assets that might grow into their promise in the years to come. And for VC fund managers dealing with the liquidation process, it\u2019s not just returns at stake but also reputation.",

        "Article Content": "It was November 2021. Buoyed by a surge of high-valuation startup IPOs involving illustrious names like Zomato, Nykaa, Paytm and Policybazaar, ecommerce logistics unicorn Delhivery decided to join the party. It filed draft papers for an IPO worth INR 7,460 Cr, an ambitious bet, as the Indian primary market was buzzing. Within two months, the logistics unicorn had to cut the issue size to INR 5,235 Cr, citing volatile market conditions. But despite all preventive measures, it made a  muted debut  in the public market in May 2022. Delhivery was the first logistics startup in India to take the IPO route, following in the footsteps of legacy players like Blue Dart, VRL Logistics, Gati, and Allcargo Logistics. Its top line outpaced many of its listed peers at the time. However, its high valuation and negative cash flow raised red flags among market experts. The company\u2019s stock is still trading 14-16% below its issue and listing prices. Now its closest competitor, Ecom Express, has joined the IPO lineup, hoping to cash in on the current momentum. The third-party logistics (3PL) player  filed its DRHP  in August 2024 for an IPO worth INR 2,600 Cr. This includes a fresh issue of equity shares up to INR 1,284.5 Cr and an offer for sale (OFS) worth INR 1,315.5 Cr. Set up in 2012 by TA Krishnan (he passed away in 2023), Manju Dhawan, K Satyanarayana and Sanjeev Saxena, it is a pure-play B2C ecommerce logistics provider, with a strong focus on the Tier II market. The 3PL player offers a full range of services, including first-mile pickup, mid-mile transportation and last-mile delivery, as well as reverse logistics and fulfilment. It has an impressive reach and covers 27K+ pin codes, where nearly 97% of the Indian population resides.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Among its top 10 customer groups are ecommerce behemoths such as Amazon, Meesho, and Nykaa, indicating its strong integration with the country\u2019s ecommerce ecosystem. Backed by a number of major investors such as British International Investment PG Esmeralda, and Eaglebay Investment,  Ecom Express  raised more than $275 Mn through multiple funding rounds. It may also consider a pre-IPO placement of INR 256.9 Cr before filing its RHP. Despite the Delhivery setback and the profitability issues currently plaguing Ecom Express (more on that later), the IPO would be of considerable interest, said Umesh Chandra Paliwal, cofounder and CEO of the unlisted share trading platform UnlistedZone.\u00a0 According to him, this listing will be a compelling case study, shedding light on whether the impact of off-metro ecommerce growth on the startup\u2019s operational margins will lead to investors\u2019 acceptance in the primary market.\u00a0 According to Inc42 analysis, the domestic ecommerce sector is estimated to grow to a  $400 Bn+ market by 2030 , with 58% of the online shoppers coming from Tier II regions and beyond. Such expansion in recent years has also led to a greater demand for evolved players like the 3PL operators. Per a Redseer report, the 3PL market exclusively servicing B2C ecommerce is on track to expand at a 24-26% CAGR, exceeding $4 Bn by FY29. This is bound to benefit the likes of Ecom Express.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The public market tends to shy away from IPOs where the OFS outweighs fresh shares, as proposed by Ecom Express (INR 1,315.5 Cr against INR 1,284.5 Cr). Yet, the recent  Unicommerce IPO , entirely an OFS, defied this market trend. It not only saw strong investor interest but also listed at a huge premium on BSE and NSE. This reveals a unique trend that businesses with strong fundamentals can flip emerging narratives. \u00a0 Ecom Express plans to allocate the bulk of its net proceeds, INR 387.4 Cr, to fund the capex for launching all-new automated  processing centres and  fulfilment centres. According to its draft filing, INR 30.6 Cr will be used to set up eight processing units. It will also utilise INR 239.2 Cr to improve its technology, cloud infrastructure and data science capabilities. Ecom Express has tapped into AI/ML and developed its proprietary platform, Bulls.ai, to predict demand patterns and streamline shipping operations. These technology features make delivery more efficient and reduce costs associated with shipment rerouting. The rest of the proceeds will be used for IT expenditure and debt servicing.\u00a0 As of March 31, 2024, the logistics major operated 115 pickup and processing centres, 81 sorting hubs, 32 fulfilment centres, 3,421 delivery centres and 89 return centres. \u201cIf we fail to expand our network at the necessary pace or at all, we may lose potential customers and market share, or a portion of our existing customers\u2019 business to our competitors,\u201d the IPO-bound startup said in its draft paper. Unlike its listed peers with diversified businesses, Ecom Express stands apart from a crowded market by focussing solely on express deliveries in the B2C ecommerce space. This strategic approach gives the logistics major more scope to scale rapidly in a booming segment. On the other hand, Delhivery handles both B2B and B2C shipments, offering express delivery, part truckload (PTL), full truckload (FTL) and cross-border logistics.\u00a0 Paliwal says Delhivery\u2019s diverse operations across ecommerce, international cargo and truck discovery via its Orion platform result in complex and varied margins. In contrast, Ecom Express enjoys higher margins and better operational efficiency by concentrating 80% of its business in Tier II cities where delivery costs are considerably lower. Interestingly, six companies, including Delhivery, Ecom Express, Blue Dart, XpressBees and Shadowfax, collectively handled more than 95% of the 3PL deliveries in the B2C ecommerce \u2018express\u2019 segment in FY24. Of these, Ecom Express managed more than 27% of the shipments in India. Another USP of Ecom Express is its emphasis on warehousing solutions and dark stores. This is tailored for its clientele in the burgeoning quick-commerce space, whose growing appeal has compelled online behemoths like Flipkart, Amazon and BigBasket to adopt different variations of this business model, intensifying competition manifold. According to its DRHP, running dark stores at its delivery centres enables Ecom Express to monetise these facilities and add to its revenue stream. Going forward, it may evaluate and venture into hyperlocal parcel service and customer-to-customer (C2C) deliveries to align better with quick commerce. It will increase growth opportunities and diversify the startup\u2019s revenue stream. Meanwhile, the startup continues to pursue its asset-light business model, a cornerstone of its core strategy. For instance, all 3,421 delivery centres are leased, not owned, and the same goes for all large facilities. Its processing units, sorting hubs, fulfilment and return centres are either leased or rented properties.\u00a0\u00a0 To reinforce this approach, more than 71% of its deliveries were completed by its gig workforce in FY24. \u201cThis asset-light business model allows us to optimise our network infrastructure and workforce depending on delivery volumes,\u201d the company said in its DRHP. Delhivery has also adopted an asset-light model but incurs capex as it invests more in fit-out infrastructure, automation, IT assets and tractor-trailers. So far, Ecom Express has not spent any money on fit-outs and other installations, but this may change going forward. In a recent interaction with Inc42, an analyst at a top brokerage firm observed that Delhivery\u2019s recent struggles were more company-specific than indicative of broader market issues. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a boom in the logistics market, and shareholder return hasn\u2019t been great, even when you look at major players like Blue Dart. But the broader market is not as grim as Delhivery\u2019s performance indicates. The issues stem from a high-valuation IPO and its failure to meet the lofty expectations it had set for investors during the IPO,\u201d the analyst pointed out. When it comes to a company\u2019s performance, there is always the proverbial Achilles heel \u2013 profitability. Ecom Express is still a loss-making entity, and its net loss stood at INR 255.8 Cr in FY24 on operating revenue of INR 2,609 Cr. While its top line grew a mere 2% from INR 2,553.9 Cr operating revenue posted in FY23, it narrowed its losses by 67% YoY, a significant improvement. As of now, its operating revenue comes from courier operations, including express parcel delivery and warehousing. However, its efforts to diversify revenue channels and push growth along those lines may witness a better outcome.\u00a0 Besides, Ecom Express is now EBITDA positive. Despite a dip from INR 83.3 Cr in FY22 to INR 3.3 Cr in FY23, it rebounded to INR 103.6 Cr in FY24. According to Paliwal, its FY24 numbers indicate a deliberate shift in strategy, with the focus on cost efficiency and profitability.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Take, for instance, the startup\u2019s FY23 exit from Paperfly, a partly-owned subsidiary in Bangladesh. Losses from its continuing operations stood at INR 248.5 Cr in FY24, but such decisive steps underscore a sound approach towards financial discipline.\u00a0 Ecom Express also  integrated drone technology  in May 2024 for last-mile delivery (to deliver beauty, personal care items and medicines) to increase efficiency and reduce transit times. During the development, the startup told Inc42 it would initially deploy drones to deliver beauty products, personal care items and medicines. \u201cThese efforts are not going unnoticed by the investor community, which is now showing increased interest in tech IPOs that demonstrate a clear path to profitability,\u201d said Paliwal. Overall, the current market sentiment is not in favour of loss-making entities. But a few standout cases, like the recent IPOs of  FirstCry  and  Awfis , prove that the market may warm to such businesses if they offer a unique value proposition and a credible road map to hit profitability. While the startup\u2019s business model, market positioning, historical growth and improving fundamentals indicate possibilities for a positive response in the public market, there are still a few challenges. Charting a consistent path to profitability is one of them. Chhavi Singh, associate partner at Redseer Strategy Consultants, told Inc42 that analysts in the logistics space are concerned about profitability, given the downward pressure on critical metrics like yield and price per shipment. But as with most sectors, economies of scale should improve profitability, she said. Incidentally, Ecom Express lowered its operating cost per shipment to INR 39.65 in FY24 from INR 45.4 in the previous fiscal year and INR 47.33 in FY22. Singh also emphasised that logistics players should improve their service mix to strengthen their position. \u201cThey can charge more for value-added services that require specialised capabilities in areas like reverse pickups, heavy shipments and express deliveries \u2013 from 30-minute to same-day/next-day options. So, a better service mix will help them with profitability,\u201d she said, adding that the increasing demand for quick commerce and hyperlocal is an important development in that direction. However, Ecom Express (and its ilk) has crucial dependency on major ecommerce players for scaling up. For instance, its top 10 customer groups contribute more than 84% to its overall top line. Any changes in the ecommerce business model, such as discontinuing logistics outsourcing, will adversely affect its growth expectations. Rohan Agarwal, a partner at Redseer Strategy Consultants, also highlighted the likelihood of ups and downs as the public market is still learning about the nitty-gritty of new-age businesses. \u201cAlthough the public market has evolved well in the past three years, given the listings of Zomato, Nykaa and others, a lot more awareness is required to understand how these businesses function and their profitability evolves,\u201d he added. Nevertheless, Ecom Express focusses solely on B2C ecommerce, a business model familiar to most Indians. It will be a more straightforward narrative for investors than  BlackBuck , a B2B logistics marketplace specialising in inter-city FTL and preparing for its market debut. It  remains to be seen if Ecom Express can overcome the concerns that dragged Delhivery down \u2013 whether the upcoming IPO will be pivotal in shaping the future of B2C ecommerce logistics.

        "Article Content": "A total of 24 founders of 15 Indian new-age tech companies took home INR 176.6 Cr in cumulative annual salary in the financial year 2023-24 (FY24)! However, the average founder salary plummeted 30.5% to INR 7.5 Cr in FY24 from INR 10.8 Cr in the previous fiscal year. This comes at a time when the startup ecosystem continues to be in the grip of the funding winter, which began in 2022. As investors tightened the purse strings following the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, there was mayhem in the Indian startup ecosystem, which was riding high on the bull run of 2020 and 2021. Consider this: The total funding raised by Indian startups fell to $25 Bn in 2022 from $42 Bn a year ago. This number further plummeted to $10 Bn in 2023 and there was no improvement in the first half of 2024 as well. This acute funding crunch has meant that Indian startups have had to take drastic measures to cut their costs and extend their runways. Following the onset of the funding winter, startups reduced their advertising and marketing budgets to cut losses or turn profitable in FY23. They also resorted to massive restructuring exercises which resulted in thousands of employees losing their jobs. Some of them even shut down operations. Amid all these, Inc42 launched \u2018Founder Salaries Tracker FY23\u2019 to keep you updated with the salaries of the founders at a time when employees were losing jobs and taking pay cuts. Continuing that, we are bringing to you the tracker for FY24, which was not much different from FY23. Consolidation remained the main theme in FY24 as well, as startups looked to improve their bottom lines even if they had to compromise on growth in their top lines. As per the data collated by Inc42, the 15 aforementioned startups posted a cumulative operating revenue of INR 36,728 Cr in FY24. Of these, five startups reported a combined loss of INR 3,771 Cr, whereas the remaining reported a total profit of INR 1,136.7 Cr.  For a deep dive into the financial numbers, take a look at Inc42\u2019s  \u2018FY24 Financials Tracker\u2019 . \n \n Now, let\u2019s delve deeper into the salaries that the startup founders earned in the last financial year. The tracker will keep you informed about the remuneration earned by the founders in FY24, the percentage increase/ decrease in their salaries compared to FY23, and more. Editor\u2019s Note: This list is not a ranking of any kind. The companies have been placed alphabetically. This is a running list and will be updated periodically. Companies are placed in alphabetical order | Data has been sourced from MCA filings, annual reports, and DRHPs | *Note: Includes Share-based payments, reimbursements, bonus, variable pay, among others Supam Maheshwari, the founder of recently listed ecommerce marketplace FirstCry, retained the top spot in terms of annual remuneration in FY24 as well. As per the startup\u2019s red herring prospectus, the founder took home INR 103.8 Cr as remuneration in FY24, which was almost 50% lower than INR 200.7 Cr a year ago. \n \n However, it needs to be highlighted that this amount includes short-term employment benefits, share based payments accrual, and excludes provisions for gratuity, compensated absences and other long term employment benefits which have been actuarially determined and the amounts pertaining to the key managerial personnel (KMP) are not material. FirstCry reported an operating revenue of  INR 6,480 Cr, with a loss of INR 321.5 Cr in FY24. \u00a0 Amit Gainda, the managing director and chief executive officer of educational lending provider Avanse Financial Services, was at the second spot in the list with an annual remuneration of INR 15.2 Cr, as per its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP). The DRHP revealed that his annual base salary stood at INR 4.2 Cr during the year under review. In FY23, Gainda received an annual remuneration of INR 4 Cr. Avanse Financial reported an operating revenue of  INR 1,726 Cr and posted a profit of INR 342.4 Cr in FY24 .\u00a0 Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the managing director of fintech giant Paytm, was at the third spot with an annual remuneration of INR 4.4 Cr during the year under review. Sharma, who is one of the most active angel investors in the county, saw a 10% hike in his annual remuneration in FY24 compared to INR 4 Cr in the previous fiscal year. Varun Alagh, the CEO of publicly listed beauty care startup Mamaearth, took home INR 3.97 Cr in annual remuneration in the recently concluded financial year. He received a hefty increment of 166.4% compared to INR 1.49 Cr he took home in the previous year.\u00a0 In comparison, his wife Ghazal Alagh, who is the cofounder of the startup, took home INR 1.79 Cr in remuneration in FY24, a jump of 80.8% higher than INR 99 Lakh in the previous fiscal year.\u00a0 The Delhi NCR-based startup reported an operating revenue of  INR 1,919.9 Cr during the year  under review with a profit of INR 110.5 Cr.\u00a0 Edited By Vinaykumar Rai Last Updated On Sept 6, 5:00 PM IST",

        "Article Content": "News agency Asia News International (ANI) has reportedly sued Netflix and producers of the show \u201cWatch IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack\u201d over alleged copyright and trademark infringement. As per Bar & Bench, the Delhi High Court on Monday (September 9) issued notices to Netflix as well as show producers, Matchbox Shots and Benaras Mediaworks, to furnish their responses in connection with the case within two days.\u00a0 A single-judge bench comprising Justice Mini Pushkarna briefly heard the matter and passed the directions. The court will next hear the matter on Friday (September 13).\u00a0 In its petition, ANI has alleged that the Netflix show used footage featuring the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, General Parvez Musharraf, and others without any licence. The news agency\u2019s counsel contended that ANI\u2019s logo is visible in one of the footages, which amounted to trademark infringement. The agency has urged the HC to pass directions to Netflix to take down the four episodes that featured ANI footage and blur its logo. ANU\u2019s counsel Sidhant Kumar argued that the news agency does not want to be associated with a show which \u201cexonerates Pakistan of its role in the plane hijack\u201d, adding that the show was now being termed as a public relations exercise for the Pakistani spy agency ISI. Kumar said while the producer of the show approached the news agency with a request for use of their footage in the year 2021, no formal agreement was signed between the two sides. \u201cThis show is only controversial but anti-national and unpatriotic in the eyes of the public. I do not want to be associated with them\u2026 Four out of the six episodes use my footage(s) extensively. I engaged a cameraperson in Pakistan who possibly has the only shot of Masood Azhar being released in Pakistan,\u201d Kumar argued.\u00a0 The counsel appearing for the producers rejected the claim. Arguing for one of the producers, advocate Hiren Kamod said that footage used in the show was obtained through two other firms, Conceptual and Wilderness, and an amount of INR 1.75 Cr was paid for it. Kamod added that the producers have a deal with British news agency Reuters (an ANI shareholder), which gave the footage to the show producers.\u00a0 Another counsel appearing for Netflix contended that the reason why ANI\u2019s logo is in one of the footage is because it was the first statement by PM Vajpayee to the media.\u00a0 \u201c\u2026 ANI just happened to be there. The purpose of showing its logo is not to take advantage or ride on the ANI name. The show glorifies the pilots and our forces,\u201d Netflix counsel told the court.\u00a0 It is pertinent to note that the show has been in trouble since its release. Last week, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B) summoned Netflix\u2019s content head Monika Shergill to seek an explanation on the alleged deviation of the show from the original incident.\u00a0 Afterwards, the OTT platform assured the government of keeping its content in accordance with \u201cnation\u2019s sentiments\u201d in the future.\u00a0\u00a0 The Anubhav Sinha-directed series, which depicts the hijacking of an Indian Airlines flight in 1999, caused an uproar online, with social media users claiming that the producers intentionally changed the names of the hijackers.\u00a0 Afterwards,  Netflix added new disclaimers to the six-episode show  to include the real and code names of the hijackers",

        "Article Content": "Zomato\u2019s food delivery platform is profitable, thanks to platform fees, and Zepto is on a tear on the quick commerce side after raising $1 Bn this year \u2014 but both need to thank  Swiggy  with at least a hat tip for showing the way. Swiggy was the first to introduce platform fees in July 2023, and Swiggy Instamart started the quick commerce revolution at the end of 2020. The Bengaluru-based company can take the credit for these two major developments in the Indian consumer internet story. But now, with its IPO on the horizon, Swiggy not only has to prove its own worth against Zomato but also against Blinkit, Zepto, BigBasket, Flipkart, Jio and others in the quick commerce segment. And this is even before we take a look at the dining out vertical, where Zomato has big plans. Some clues about Swiggy\u2019s strategy can be seen in this week\u2019s reports about  its FY24 numbers . Over the past month or so, it has also launched several new revenue streams. Swiggy is going full throttle ahead of the IPO, but will this be enough to make a bull run in the public markets? Let\u2019s find out, after these top stories from our newsroom. It\u2019s all about the IPO. Swiggy\u2019s upcoming IPO is the most anticipated public listing for investors, as highlighted in Inc42\u2019s  recent investor survey after H1 2024 . Swiggy, which was last valued at $10.7 Bn, is said to be targeting  a valuation of $15 Bn for the IPO  where it will look to raise anywhere between $1 Bn and $1.2 Bn. VC and PE giants such as Prosus, Accel, SoftBank and Invesco among others will be looking to cash in on the IPO, which follows a very critical year for Swiggy in terms of proving its revenue scale as well as a path to profitability. We reported in early 2024 that  Swiggy could report over INR 10,000 Cr  in revenue for FY24, but it turned out to be much higher than that. According to details from its annual report, the company saw its revenue grow by 36% to INR 11,247 Cr from INR 8,265 Cr in FY23. More importantly, Swiggy also slashed its net loss by 44% to INR 2,350 Cr during the year under review from INR 4,179 Cr in FY23. Without a look at the audited financials, one can only assume that a lot of the expenses have been incurred as the company expanded its quick commerce network in 2023 and 2024. The big surge in Instamart quick commerce orders, introduction of platform fees midway through FY24, and growing traction for its ads and dining out business are the platforms that Swiggy is using to attract investors ahead of its IPO. The company even got a round of minor infusions this past month, with Amitabh Bachchan\u2019s family office, Hindustan Composites, Motilal Oswal Financial Services\u2019 chairman Raamdeo Agrawal joining the cap table recently. With $1.4 Bn in revenue in FY24, Swiggy\u2019s potential price of $15 Bn in the IPO seems to be justified to a certain extent. Swiggy investor 360 One, formerly known as IIFL, recently pegged the company\u2019s valuation at $11.5 Bn, with a revenue of $1.4 Bn. In this regard, Swiggy has a lower revenue multiple of just over 10X compared to Zomato\u2019s (close to 20X), thanks to a market cap of $30 Bn. Zomato\u2019s FY24 revenue stood at INR 13,545 Cr or roughly $1.6 Bn. The biggest factor for Zomato has been it turning profitable on this revenue base. Swiggy is yet to prove that, though it does look like the Bengaluru-based company might turn the corner soon. For most comparisons, it would be a folly to put Swiggy and Zomato against Zepto directly, as the latter is wholly focussed on quick commerce. For Swiggy and Zomato, food delivery is bread and butter, or it should be, but the rise of quick commerce has come at the expense of slower growth in food delivery volume, at least for Zomato. Will this also be the case with Swiggy? By the time Swiggy goes to the public markets, the revenue figure could well be over $2 Bn, especially because the company has structured its main verticals to maximise revenue collection. On the food delivery front, Swiggy has looked to expand revenue streams from both ends. For consumers, there\u2019s the platform fees as well as Swiggy One subscriptions. It has also looked to make itself indispensable for restaurants. Within a matter of days in July, the company  launched  marketing tool \u2018Smart Links\u2019 to help restaurants widen online reach and boost orders, as well as a data analytics tool for restaurant partners to gauge their marketing performance against peers. It also rolled out a SaaS suite for partner restaurants to leverage influencer and social media marketing. Then there\u2019s \u2018Staffing Support\u2019, an initiative to assist its restaurant partners with staff recruitment. Most recently, Swiggy launched a large order delivery fleet in metros to compete with a similar offering by Zomato. This fleet is meant to be a way for Swiggy  to cater to festive season demand more efficiently. Sources in the company told Inc42 that for long it has been believed that food delivery is underpenetrated, and if that\u2019s the case, the only way to maximise revenues and profits is to extract more revenue per user. Platform fee has been hiked to INR 6 per order in its key markets, including Delhi and Bengaluru, and this could go even further up depending on how Swiggy sees food delivery growing. We expect Swiggy to add more premium features for users and restaurants going forward because this is where it is catering to habituated users and app-dependent kitchens. For consumers, using Swiggy can be a discounts-related alternative for Zomato at certain points in time, so offsetting the occasional discounts with per-order platform fee makes sense. On the restaurant side, Swiggy is looking at cloud kitchens and large restaurants as a growth category. These are the partners who have the most to lose if Swiggy were to suddenly shut its food delivery business. Large restaurants are double-sided partners too, featuring on the Dineout side of the Swiggy revenue menu as well, while cloud kitchens would simply not exist without apps. There is a lot of business rationale in pushing food delivery towards the revenue side and keeping quick commerce towards the growth side. The scope for experimentation is higher on quick commerce right now as the competition is also higher. With a duopoly on the food delivery side, Swiggy can rest easy in the knowledge that it can\u2019t be blind-sided by a third player. The revenue potential is also way higher for quick commerce in comparison to food delivery, since the former has a higher order frequency per user. \u201cQuick commerce is the key for long term profitability. Blinkit has already outpaced Zomato\u2019s food delivery business. A Goldman Sachs report this week said that Blinkit\u2019s contribution to Zomato\u2019s market value has surpassed the core food delivery business. So Instamart will be extremely critical for Swiggy,\u201d Rahul Jain, vice president of brokerage firm Dolat Capital,  told Inc42 earlier this year.\u00a0 But Swiggy is also said to be losing ground to Zepto and Blinkit in the quick commerce business. Zepto, which has raised over $1 Bn this year, is gearing up for expansion and is likely to launch 100s of new dark stores across the country this year. To boost average order value for quick commerce, Swiggy expanded the non-grocery category for footwear, appliances, fashion, beauty and electronics within Instamart. Other players have done the same, and the entry of Flipkart and JioMart is quickly blurring the line between quick commerce and ecommerce. This will be critical as Zepto claims to be on pace to achieve $1.2 Bn in annual sales in FY24, which will undoubtedly be helped by the recent introduction of Zepto Pass loyalty programme and  a per-order platform fee , as well its plans to launch a  BNPL-like Zepto Postpaid product . Zepto is not sitting back when it comes to big plans either, and is reported to be in talks with bankers  for an August 2025 date for a public listing . Even though it remains the second largest quick commerce player in India after Blinklit, Swiggy has seemingly lost its first mover advantage in this category. How deeply will this hurt the Bengaluru-based giant? What complicates this further is the big push for quick commerce from  the likes of Tata-owned BigBasket , which has the category expertise and the scale to compete with Blinkit, Zepto and Swiggy. In fact, BigBasket is merging quick commerce into its main app, which will immediately widen its customer base. It\u2019s interesting that despite Zomato hitting the public markets before Swiggy, it was not a moment for quick commerce. Swiggy\u2019s IPO will be the first real litmus test of how the public markets embrace the quick commerce model and its revenue trajectory. It\u2019s arguably why the Swiggy IPO is being watched so closely by everyone in the startup ecosystem.",

        "Article Content": "In the realm of energy, the transition from a linear \u2018take-make-waste\u2019 model to a sustainable circular economy is not merely a shift in perspective; it represents a comprehensive rethinking of how we design, produce, and consume energy resources.\u00a0 At the heart of this shift lies the concept of second-life batteries (SLBs), a paradigm of value creation that has profound implications for the Energy Transition. SLBs.\u00a0 Often derived from electric vehicle (EV) batteries that have reached the end of their automotive life, SLBs embody a transformative approach towards enhancing energy storage, promoting circular economy principles, reducing costs, addressing resource scarcity, and influencing policy and regulation.\u00a0 The viability of the field of battery second life or battery repurposing/reuse is accelerating the energy transition ecosystem\u2019s growth, both in scale and in circularity. The capability to store energy efficiently and economically is paramount to all Net Zero and Industrial Decarbonisation efforts. Second-life batteries offer a compelling solution to this challenge.\u00a0 These batteries retain approximately 70-80% of their initial capacity even after their use in EVs, according to reports featured on Deloitte. This residual capacity can be harnessed for less demanding applications, making SLBs ideal candidates for a diverse range of stationary energy storage systems (ESS).\u00a0 SLBs play a pivotal role in supporting the integration of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, into the energy mix. They function as energy reservoirs, storing excess energy generated during peak production periods and releasing it during periods of high demand or low production.\u00a0 This ability to smooth out imbalances between supply and demand makes SLBs invaluable in the quest to replace fossil fuel \u201cpeaker\u201d plants, which are called upon for a few hours each day when energy demands surge. By doing so, SLBs facilitate the expansion of renewables and expedite the transition to a carbon-free power grid.\u00a0 Battery lifecycle management companies aim to identify second-life applications for these batteries, ensuring that most of the raw materials from used batteries are either recycled or refurbished in alignment with Extended Producer Responsibility guidelines, which are implemented in India through the Battery Waste Management Rules (BWM Rules 2022). The extracted materials are then channelled into the manufacturing of Lithium-ion cells, fostering a circular economy for EV batteries. Second-life batteries, with their residual capacity and rejuvenated purpose, present significant economic advantages centred around demand easing and value optimisation. These batteries can be around or over 50% cheaper than their first-life counterparts, according to various reports.\u00a0 This cost-effectiveness extends not only to the individual consumer but also helps accelerate the broader energy storage ecosystem. As the demand for Energy Storage System (ESS) batteries eases due to the integration of SLBs flowing in from repurposed EV batteries, we will see a positive impact on the affordability of both EVs and ESS.\u00a0 In essence, SLBs offer a practical means to make sustainability, renewables, and energy security more accessible to a wider audience by virtue of lowered costs and abundantly versatile use cases.\u00a0 The surging demand for EVs has led to concerns regarding the availability and price volatility of critical metals required for battery production. SLBs provide a strategy to extend the value of these resources, thereby also addressing resource scarcity. By repurposing and reusing these batteries, we alleviate supply concerns, thereby enhancing resource security and mitigating the risk of critical material shortages. The rise of SLBs has necessitated the development of appropriate policies and regulations. These include standards for battery handling and disassembly, market structures for SLBs, and measures to prevent mass disposal.\u00a0 India has significantly promoted energy storage systems through its National Framework for Energy Storage Systems. The Ministry of Power released this framework, which aims to integrate ESS as a fundamental part of the country\u2019s power infrastructure.\u00a0 In the guidelines, India has included solar projects with ESS within its scope, a notable expansion from the previous version. This inclusion emphasises the importance of energy storage in the context of renewable energy generation.\u00a0 The framework also encourages the development of round-the-clock energy projects, fostering energy security and grid stability. It enables shorter power purchase agreement (PPA) tenures, reducing the standard term from 25 to 20 years, which can facilitate the tariff landscape in the renewable energy sector. These developments reflect India\u2019s commitment to enhancing energy storage and its role in supporting renewable energy integration. The paradigm shift represented by second-life batteries extends to the microcosm of individual choices and resonates in the macrocosmic realm of global energy sustainability. Each battery we extend the life of, and each material we recycle, is a contribution to the grand journey towards a circular economy of clean energy.\u00a0 Second-life batteries thus embody a luminous example of the benefits of switching from a linear to a circular economy, providing value, sustainability, and a promising pathway to address global energy challenges.\u00a0 It is imperative that we continue to support and invest in this paradigm of value creation as we strive for a more sustainable future in energy, as exemplified by India\u2019s announcement of the National Framework for Promoting ESS and recent sector partnerships for battery repurposing.",

        "Article Content": "Entertainment consumption trends in India have swung like a pendulum in the past five years. While the Covid-induced lockdowns put a dampener on India\u2019s flourishing movie theatre businesses, it proved to be a blessing for over-the-top (OTT) streaming platforms. While many of these platforms were already operational in the country for some years by then, what exacerbated the influx of users to these streaming platforms were strong tailwinds such as affordable high-speed internet, a sharp uptick in the number of internet users and increased adoption of digital payments. Since then, these players have barely looked back. The OTT streaming market in India reached an all-time high in 2023, with about 707 Mn internet users having been actively engaged in OTT audio and video services, as per \u2018Internet in India Report 2023\u2019. Realising that there was a huge pent-up demand for such services, global giants such as Netflix, Amazon and Disney+ Hotstar aggressively poached users with expansive content libraries, discounted pricing (in some cases 70-90% lower than their US plans), and bundled plans in partnerships with telecom operators. On the other hand, homegrown platforms like Zee5, TVF Play and Stage tapped into the growing demand for vernacular content that catered to India across the board.\u00a0 Later on, the entry of JioCinema disrupted the ecosystem to such an extent that Disney+ Hotstar had to set in motion its $8.5 Bn merger with the Reliance-backed streaming platform. And this dogfight in the Indian streaming market is not without reason. As per reports, the Indian subscription video on demand (SVOD) market in India is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.1% to become a $2.77 Bn opportunity by 2027. Glaring at this huge market, we thought of curating a list of the top OTT players shaping the Indian streaming landscape. So, without further ado, here is the full list: Note: This is not a ranking of any kind, and the companies are listed in alphabetical order. Founded by film producer and distributor Allu Arvind in 2020, Aha streams content in two regional languages \u2013 Telugu and Tamil. The platform is owned by Arha Media and Broadcasting Private Limited, which is a joint venture between Geetha Arts and My Home Group. The platform claims that it has a paid subscriber base of 2.5 Mn. Its app has over 1 Cr downloads on the Google Play Store. The platform\u2019s subscription plans vary from INR 99 for three months to INR 899 a year. In 2023, Aha\u2019s promoter Allu Aravind and CEO Ajit Thakur said that the platform would receive an investment of over INR 1,000 Cr in the next three years. Aha will be deploying the fresh capital towards consolidation of its current languages and expansion into new languages and genres. Addatimes, an OTT platform that primarily streams Bengali content, was launched in 2016 by Rajiv Mehra. The platform expanded to Bangladesh in 2020 and was later acquired by Surinder Films, a production house focusing on Bengali content, in 2023.\u00a0 The platform produces original series as well as full feature films adding to its 6000 hours of content, which is available in over 170 countries. Although popular with its Bengali audience, the platform also offers content in Hindi and Odia.

        "Article Content": "The world\u2019s third-largest startup ecosystem has come a long way since February 2020, when the DPIIT recognised that India was home to just over 27,000 startups, and when we rolled out the first edition of Inc42\u2019s \u201c30 Startups To Watch\u201d series. Fast forward to June 2024, the number of  DPIIT-registered startups surged to over 1.4 Lakh . But the most intriguing part isn\u2019t just the numbers. Well, at the outset of 2020, the ever-zealous Inc42 team decided to tap into the very core of the Indian startup ecosystem \u2014 early stage startups.\u00a0 Fuelled with our passion for the ecosystem, we vowed to identify 30 high-potential startups every month \u2014 the ones that could one day transition to become the Amazon, Alibaba, Intel or even Google of tomorrow. In our pursuit, we have tread a long way \u2014 closely observing hundreds of startups every month, carefully fathoming their long-term potential, and testing the waters of the vision and philosophies of founders.\u00a0 Continuing our sprint to find the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of early stage startups, after carefully churning through thousands of early stage Indian startups, we today stand to introduce the  50th edition of Inc42\u2019s flagship series \u2014 \u2018 30 Startups To Watch \u2019 .\u00a0 Notably, the golden cohort (50th) of our much-awaited monthly series is being introduced at a time when the investor interest is seemingly skewed towards early stage startups, courtesy of GenAI.\u00a0 Per the  Inc42 H1 2024 funding report , seed and growth-stage companies drove the funding trend in H1 2024. Favoured by the advent of AI, the Indian seed-stage startup funding received a booster shot, catapulting it 23% YoY to $589 Mn across 229 deals in H1 2024. Now as Indian early stage ventures prepare to make hay while the investor sun still shines, we present to you the 30 startups that caught our eyes in August. Editor\u2019s Note:  The list below is not a ranking of any kind. We have listed the startups alphabetically.

Dr Arpit Jayswal founded  Curelo  in May 2022 in response to the widespread issues of unreliable and inconvenient diagnostic services, particularly among local and regional labs.\u00a0 Jayswal\u2019s motivation stemmed from his personal experience with his father, who suffered from chronic kidney disease and needed frequent blood tests before and after dialysis sessions. This experience pointed to the need for a dependable solution in the diagnostic sector. After extensive market research, Jayswal realised that the problem was widespread throughout the country, and to address this gap, he incorporated Curelo to provide reliable and convenient diagnostic services to everyone, regardless of their location or mobility challenges.

Overall, as per the startup\u2019s claims, its clients have seen a 12% increase in their average order value. Dopplr counts Cava Athleisure, Being Human, and Cancel Culture Club in its list of clientele. In August, the startup secured $750K in its maiden funding round led by Cornerstone Ventures.

In a landscape where online dating apps are flourishing, fueled by a youthful population with rising disposable incomes, Juleo aims to differentiate itself by focusing on fostering real-life connections rather than prolonging digital interactions. Members can apply to join the exclusive Juleo Club through their app, which ensures security and authenticity by using India Stack\u2019s government ID and video verification. This level of verification is essential in a market where privacy and safety are major concerns. Juleo\u2019s AI-powered matchmaking, Genie, carefully selects potential matches and manages the logistics of arranging in-person meetings, removing the need for constant swiping and superficial online conversations.\u00a0 Women\u2019s profiles are private by default, giving them control over their visibility and helping to avoid unwanted attention. This thoughtful feature addresses the importance of privacy and safety in India, especially for women. For men, the platform reduces the pressure of maintaining an online persona, shifting the focus to meaningful, real-world interactions. The matchmaking platform announced on August 6 that it has  secured $2.5 Mn  from more than 180 angel investors, including the likes of Livspace cofounder Ramakant Sharma, CRED founder Kunal Shah, and Acko cofounder Ruchi Deepak.\u00a0 Entering the generative AI fray, serial entrepreneurs Shivam Gupta and Akshat Anand launched  LLUMO AI  in 2023. The startup addresses the challenges of evaluating LLM performance in real-world scenarios. The startup also helps businesses reduce GenAI costs by up to 80%. The platform offers two proprietary LLMs trained on extensive data. The first model compresses prompts to lower costs while preserving output quality. The second, Eval-LM, evaluates LLM-generated output without requiring ground truth data. These models allow businesses to optimise LLM use, speed up iterations, and manage budgets effectively. The startup launched LLUMO beta version last month in July. It says that its closest competitor, FrugalGPT, utilises the open-source platform Lingua for prompt compression and cost-saving. \u201cWhile Lingua does compress prompts effectively, it often sacrifices key context, resulting in a cosine similarity score of only 50% to 60% between the original and compressed prompt outputs. This also leads to a higher risk of hallucination,\u201d Gupta said. In contrast, Gupta said that LLUMO AI not only compresses prompts but also employs an advanced caching management system that saves over 80% of costs without losing crucial context. Our cosine similarity scores range from 88% to 93%, ensuring high-quality output with minimal deviation from the original intent.\u00a0 Earlier this month, the startup raised $1 Mn in its seed funding round led by SenseAI Ventures.

After successfully building, scaling, and exiting their companies, they created a deeptech startup that serves global businesses from India. Nected\u2019s mission is to free up valuable tech resources from repetitive and iterative tasks by democratising access to technology. In a trillion-dollar software development market, where over 100 Mn developers face ongoing tech shortages, Nected addresses the critical need for digitisation and automation.\u00a0 The platform allows teams to quickly build complex, data-driven workflows, enabling faster experimentation and iteration with minimal cost and effort. Recently, the startup  raised $1.7 Mn  in funding through a convertible note, led by 3STATE Venture. Nected has a growing list of clients, including industry leaders like TATA 1mg, and has established a significant presence across sectors such as fintech, ecommerce, retail, travel, edtech, logistics, and consulting.\u00a0 With over 50 clients across more than five countries, Nected is helping them save 60% of their tech resources, speed up time to market by over 5X, and accelerate iteration processes by 10X.\u00a0 NeuraSim  is focussed on advancing neuroscience by integrating virtual reality technology into healthcare treatments.

Its drone docking station is capable of undertaking complex activities such as take-off, landing, flight surveillance, charging and data extraction.\u00a0 NxtQube is backed by the likes of Venture Catalysts, Pontaq VC, and Ananta Bizcon, among others. As of now, the startup has set its eyes on developing a battery-swapping module, docks with swarm capabilities, docks catering to the logistics sector, and platforms for virtual piloting. Additionally, the Nashik-based company plans to expand its footprint to new geographies such as Asia Pacific, Europe, and the US in the short term.\u00a0 When millions of Indians were locked indoors during the peak of Covid 19-induced lockdowns in 2022, Parth Jindal, Ronak Daftary, Jigar Doshi, Nikhil Sachdev, and Pratik Doshi were introduced to Mexican racket sport Padel Tennis through online videos.\u00a0 Enamoured by the sport, the quintet decided to introduce the sport to the country.

The startup\u2019s offerings comprise a comprehensive online listing experience, including high-quality photos, videos, 3D tours, etc.\u00a0 The platform also provides essential information such as pollution levels and AQI, enabling buyers to make well-informed decisions. Every property listed on Truva undergoes rigorous legal and physical verification, ensuring that buyers receive detailed quality reports, title guarantees, and even buyback options. For sellers, Truva guarantees a sale within six months and covers rent until the transaction is completed. This allows Truva to enhance properties, resulting in sales that are up to ten times faster than the market average.\u00a0 Truva\u2019s revenue model involves selling homes at a slightly higher price than the guaranteed offer to sellers, with the difference serving as the company\u2019s profit.

        "Article Content": "Social media has influenced everything from the way we interact to the way we make purchasing decisions. However, a growing disillusionment seems to be emerging among Gen Z, the quintessential followers of social media.\u00a0 Often stereotyped as digital natives glued to their screens, this demographic may be close to reaching a tipping point. A recent survey by Talker Research of 2,000 Gen Z Americans found that three out of four believe social media negatively impacts their mental health.\u00a0 Despite this, many are not ready to abandon social platforms. They cite boredom and the need for distractions as the reasons to stay engaged. This raises an important question: Can we eliminate doom scrolling while still enjoying the benefits of social media? Ish Goel, a serial entrepreneur and the founder of Hunch, believes that the key to solving this issue lies in transforming users from passive consumers into active contributors. \u201cThe 1:10:90 rule applies to most social media platforms, which is 1% create content, 10% engage, and 90% merely consume,\u201d Goel said, adding that Hunch aspires to change this by giving voice to silent spectators online. To challenge the current state of affairs, Ish, along with Nitika Goel and Kartic Rakhra, founded the new-age social media discovery platform, Hunch, in December 2022. Imperative to mention that the trio had previously founded PlotX, a Web3 gaming startup, in 2020. Moving on, the premise of Dubai-based Hunch is simple \u2014 The platform allows users to create polls on any topic \u2014 from politics to education, entertainment, dating and more \u2014 while maintaining complete anonymity. Unlike traditional platforms, Hunch has no private accounts and its polls are open to all. Users can engage by voting, or \u2018hunching\u2019 (as the founders like to call), commenting or adding emojis and likes. They can also follow each other without the pressure of revealing their identities. The founders hope this anonymity will lead to more candid discussions on the new-age social media discovery platform, providing users with a safe space to express their thoughts without the fear of being judged. Currently, Hunch claims to have over 2 Mn users in India and the US. The platform targets young adults between 18 and 30 years of age. Highlighting the core philosophy of their platform, the founders said that the Hunch app transforms \u2018likes\u2019 and \u2018follows\u2019 into meaningful connections and cultivates an environment that is both authentic and interactive. \u201cWe empower users to express themselves freely without the burden of societal expectations and getting judged,\u201d Ish said. With its thesis to completely change the existing social media paradigm, Hunch aspires to challenge the dominance of established players. Interestingly, the startup aims to accomplish this by betting big on polls. Unlike other platforms that offer polls just as a feature, Hunch places them at the core of its user experience.\u00a0 Further, the concept of anonymity also resonates strongly with social media users, which the Hunch founders claim to have championed in their endeavour. A  2024 study  by the University of Queensland reveals that people prefer to remain anonymous online because it provides a sense of comfort, especially for those who are self-conscious or socially anxious in real life. Anonymity allows them to participate in discussions and form relationships without feeling exposed. Hunch leverages this insight to its advantage. However, on the flipside, the same study also notes that anonymity can lead to antisocial behaviour, such as trolling or cyberbullying, due to lack of accountability. So, how does Hunch address this issue? Well, for this, the startup has created clear and comprehensive guidelines that define what is acceptable on the platform and what\u2019s not. The app\u2019s guidelines are in line with the laws in India and the US. To manage user-generated content, Hunch employs a robust content moderation system that combines AI-powered tools and a dedicated review team. Users can report the content, including private messages, which they believe violates community guidelines.\u00a0 The app\u2019s reporting feature is user-friendly, allowing individuals to label specific violations and offer additional context. Each report is manually reviewed by an in-house team, while AI tools assist in identifying content that breaches community guidelines. Additionally, Hunch\u2019s in-app reputation system, driven by a \u2018Vibe score\u2019, filters out bot accounts and helps distinguish between good actors from bad ones. Entering a market dominated by giants like Facebook, Linkedin, Instagram, and others has not been an easy feat for the Hunch founders. Despite this, as per Ish, they have been able to successfully capture the attention of social media users through a well-thought-out strategy, primarily focussed on product differentiation and marketing. Meanwhile, Hunch\u2019s tech team, which is entirely based in India, has developed a proprietary algorithm designed to match user profiles with content that aligns with their interests. \u201cOur entire tech and product team operates out of India. We have hired top-tier tech talent. Our tech stack includes a diverse range of tools, including GraphQL, Kinesis and more,\u201d Ish said. The algorithm analyses the polls a user answers and recommends connections with others who have similar responses. The more polls a user engages with, the richer the data, which enhances the app\u2019s ability to connect people with shared interests and viewpoints.\u00a0 This matching system ensures that users encounter others who resonate with their preferences, allowing them to build more meaningful and relevant interactions. For example, if a user frequently engages with content related to dating, their feed will likely feature more dating-related polls. This personalised approach ensures a relevant and engaging user experience. However, what\u2019s more interesting is that Hunch\u2019s social media bet with polls at the centre seems to be resonating well with venture capitalists (VCs), too. The startup first raised $3 Mn in seed capital in December 2022. Then, in March 2024, it secured  $23 Mn in a Series A funding  round led by Alpha Wave. South Korea-based VC firm Hashed Emergent and others also participated in the round. The funding push has been pivotal for Hunch, enabling it to scale its tech team and fuel its marketing efforts. Ish noted that as a new entrant in the social media space, the startup initially faced several challenges in encouraging users to transition from familiar platforms to Hunch.\u00a0 To take control of the situation, the founders adopted a marketing strategy that comprised performance and brand-based approaches, including PR efforts, influencer campaigns and campus marketing initiatives. Buoyed by growing interest from Indian users, Hunch gained the confidence to expand and launched in the US in 2023. This move was a logical step, given that India and the US are the largest social media user nations globally, with 755.47 Mn and 302.25 Mn users, respectively, after China at 1Bn+, according to  Demandsage . Currently in its pre-revenue stage, the founders\u2019 short term goal is to create a sustainable revenue stream. To capitalise on the value and utility that users gain from the platform, the startup is primarily considering monetisation through in-app purchases. In addition, the startup is laser focussed on solidifying its presence in the US market, all while broadening its user base in India.\u00a0 As per Ish, the strategy is different from most of its Indian counterparts. For example, Koo and Moj attempted to Indianise X and TikTok, respectively. While  Koo has now ceased to exist , the Indian government pulled the plug on TikTok on June 29, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 With hardly anything in common, Hunch is actively pursuing its goal of empowering global users to voice their opinions. However, come as it may, the anonymity proposition could be a double-edged sword.\u00a0 While it allows people the freedom to express themselves, it also opens the door for misinformation and hate speech. To mitigate these risks, the founders will need to make sure that the platform does not become a breeding ground for trolls and cyberbullies. ",

        "Article Content": "The world\u2019s third largest startup ecosystem has been in the midst of a raging funding winter for a couple of years now. As investors tightened their purse strings, the Indian startup ecosystem has had to go through a lot of pain, which included thousands of employees losing their jobs.\u00a0 This was especially true for the fiscal year 2023-24 (FY24), when the funding drought peaked. Far from the capital boom of 2021, when fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors drove a valuation bubble, FY23 and FY24 turned out to be a reality check for the startup ecosystem as many shut shop while others took the debt route to extend their runways.\u00a0 However, not everything was doom and gloom. The struggle of the funding winter brought with it sanity in valuations and forced startups to cut their expenses to chart a profitable growth. This trend was evident in the financial statements of Indian startups in FY23 and seems to have continued in FY24 as well. Of the 42 startups that have released their financial statements for FY24 so far, 28 ended the year with profitable numbers. Their cumulative profit stood at INR 3,716.29 Cr.\u00a0 The likes of Zomato, PB Fintech, Honasa and Milk Mantra turned profitable during the year under review. Meanwhile, the remaining 14 startups posted a cumulative loss of INR 6,094 Cr, with just Paytm and Ola Electric accounting for more than INR 3,000 Cr of this loss figure. However, it needs to be highlighted that many of these startups were also able to cut their losses in FY24. In terms of top line, the 42 startups posted a cumulative operating revenue of INR 1 Lakh Cr (INR 1,06,297.87 Cr to be precise) in the year ended March 2024.\u00a0 So, without further ado, let\u2019s take a look at the financial performance of some of these startups in FY24.

        "Article Content": "Navigating different avenues to raise capital has always been daunting for businesses, particularly for startups and small and medium enterprises (SME) with limited expertise in banking and finance. Today, many of them are exploring debt funding as raising equity gets harder. It is the right time as the lending environment gets increasingly favourable to startups and SMEs. But for that, companies need to improve their internal processes and boost their risk profiles. A stable interest rate regime is expected to boost debt financing. Economists are forecasting the current high-interest rate cycle to end soon. Major economies, including India, have witnessed high interest rates over the past few years. However, with inflation cooling off, central banks have taken a more dovish stance towards borrowing. As interest rates plateau, debt financing becomes an attractive proposition for companies. Moreover, the central government announced a slew of measures in Budget 2024 to boost credit availability for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), such as a credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs in the manufacturing sector and credit support  during financial stress . The proposal to allow public sector banks to adopt in-house methods for credit assessment, including incorporating data from a company\u2019s digital financial footprint, is another positive move. Traditionally, equity and debt have been the two basic types of financing. According to the latest  Indian Tech Startup Funding Report  by Inc42, the share of debt funding in Indian startups is growing. The value of debt investments in the first half of 2024 reached $576 Mn, more than double the amount raised in 2023. Interest in debt funding is growing for several reasons. Founders can retain their stake in the business and reduce the cost of raising capital. They can use interest payments as a tax-deductible expense. Moreover, a fixed repayment schedule makes it easier to forecast cash flows.\u00a0 But there are disadvantages too. Businesses find it difficult to find the right partner to bank with. Besides banks and non-banking finance companies, there are venture debt funds, a new class of debt funding.\u00a0 Secondly, although fixed repayments are good for financial forecasting and modelling, they can exacerbate financial difficulties when a company experiences irregular cash flows. It takes much more than a sleek marketing campaign to convince lenders of a company\u2019s ability to honour repayment terms. Founders need to demonstrate business viability and robust financials to lenders. Critical factors that ensure a positive outcome of a loan application are the company\u2019s internal risk rating and its ability to map its requirements to the fast-evolving, complex lender ecosystem. The external environment for debt financing is encouraging for MSMEs. However, business owners need to display long-term commitment and prepare their organisation to move in that direction. Strong internal practices and professional help for a nuanced understanding of the market will go a long way in securing funding.\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "In the startup world, an entrepreneur\u2019s primary objective is to either identify white space for disruption or solve a real-world problem. However, not everyone is bestowed with the vision to identify disruption opportunities and provide a solution thereof. While that could be true for a majority of startup founders and the ones to be,  Solinas Integrity , a deeptech startup born out of IIT Madras, has been laser-focussed on solving multiple problems related to water and wastewater management since 2018. Founded by Moinak Banerjee, Divanshu Kumar, and Bhavesh Narayani, the startup began its journey with a pipeline inspection crawler and claims to have developed India\u2019s first robot for septic tank and manhole cleaning. But here\u2019s the intriguing part: Two of the founders originally had completely different aspirations, which somehow converged to pave the way for Solinas. Today, the startup works in tandem with multiple government departments, including municipal corporations. Alongside its public sector clients, Solinas also serves private sector giants like Suez, Veolia, Volvo, Hyundai, and Mahindra. In a conversation with Inc42, cofounder Banerjee revealed that his path to Solinas was quite different from that of his cofounders. Reflecting on the inception story of Solinas, the cofounder said that while living in Sweden, he often wondered that the quality of water being made available to Indian households was hardly on par with any European country. \u201cThere is no concept of water filters there, and one can directly drink tap water. I realised that India was nowhere closer to the amount of technology intervention these countries have in maintaining water pipelines. This hit a nerve, and I left my job at Scania to build a similar solution for India,\u201d Banerjee said. At a time when Banerjee was contemplating a solution that could clean water pipelines in the country so that Indians do not have to rely on overly expensive water filters, he met his old friend Kumar, who wanted to solve India\u2019s water and sanitation problems too but in a different way.\u00a0 Well, Kumar\u2019s focus was largely on putting an end to the inhumane practice of human scavenging that has persisted long enough to bow the nation\u2019s head in shame.\u00a0 For the uninitiated, manual scavenging involves the manual cleaning, handling, and disposal of human waste and other materials from dry, open drains, sewers and manholes. Adding pangs to the problems are the deaths that happen due to this work every year.  For context: As many as  330 individuals died in accidents  while cleaning sewers and septic tanks between 2017 and 2021. Notably, this is just the reported data, which may not agree with the actual one.\u00a0  Filled with despair and resentment observing the state of night soil carriers, despite an official ban since 1993, he was too engaged in using his technical prowess to put a stop to this practice once and for all. \u201cComing out of his master\u2019s program at IIT, Kumar was passionate about developing a solution to the problem of manual scavenging. What fuelled his hopes was the fact that while there were various solutions and technologies, none were affordable or effective enough to address the root cause,\u201d Banerjee said.\u00a0 At the time, as per Banerjee, Kumar was developing a solution to address everything that was otherwise missing from the market. Also, as luck would have it, the two happened to meet to discuss the prospect of Kumar\u2019s project, leading to the realisation that the tech solution could be built to effectively cater to both problems.  From there on, it was just a matter of time before they found themselves working on Endobot, a pipeline inspection crawler. Also, they had a clear vision to rope in municipalities and public facility departments as their clients.\u00a0 At the outset, the cofounders told Inc42 that as engineers, they had some technical knowledge but lacked a clear understanding of how to build a business.\u00a0  Therefore, they focussed on developing solutions, like robots or software. While the tech was in place, they struggled to create a sustainable business model.\u00a0 \u201cFor the first year and a half, we were trying to figure out how to ensure our company\u2019s survival and turn our solutions into a viable business. When we launched our first product about two and a half years ago, we were still operating more like students running small pilots rather than as a business,\u201d the cofounders said.\u00a0 However, these pilots, conducted with companies like LMT and Suez, taught them valuable lessons about how to structure their business model and refine solutions.\u00a0  As they moved forward, they realised that their initial approach needed significant fine-tuning to make it scalable across India and to build a successful business. Also, working with the government in the early stages was particularly challenging. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just difficult; we were also uninformed about how to navigate business dealings with government entities. Over time, we built a network of channel partners who helped us engage with the government more effectively. Through trial and error, we began to crystalise our business model, and that\u2019s when our real journey started,\u201d they said. Currently, the startup has three patented technologies \u2014 Endobot for sewer and water management; HomoSEP for septic tanks and manholes, and Swasth AI. The startup has designed its Endobot sewer robots to unclog pipes ranging from 120 mm to 1,000 mm. Equipped with GIS positioning, visual analytics, and digital reporting, these bots provide comprehensive solutions for sewer maintenance. On the other hand, the EndoBot for water is engineered to efficiently manage and maintain water pipelines. According to the company\u2019s website, this bot navigates through pipes and conduits, detecting issues like illegal water connections, contamination, and other failures that could disrupt water supplies. Moving on, with HomoSEP ATOM, which the startup claims to be the country\u2019s 1st septic tank cleaning robot, Solinas is on a mission to end manual scavenging once and for all. The tech also allows industries, societies, private water supply bodies, and the government to effectively process and separate the sludge of septic tanks and manholes with little to no impact on the environment. Meanwhile, the startup\u2019s product stack also comprises a cloud-based storage and data management solution, Swasth AI. Notably, the data collected through EndoBot is processed for defect localisation with GIS tagging, and a customised report is generated in the Swasth AI dashboard. \u201cWe leverage AI to identify when the pipelines will fail and figure out the remaining life of the pipelines. This predictive approach enables proactive maintenance, potentially saving municipalities significant resources in the long run,\u201d the cofounders said. It is imperative to note that the cofounders appeared on Shark Tank India\u2019s Season 2. The startup was able to secure a deal of INR 90 Lakh for a 3% equity stake from sharks Anupam Mittal and Peyush Bansal. \u201cAt the time, we were at a very early stage in our journey, and our primary motivation for applying was that we were fundraising. Even though the types of companies that usually appear on Shark Tank are quite different from ours, we saw it as a great opportunity to raise awareness. Being on national television allowed us to shed light on the critical issues in India\u2019s water and sanitation sector,\u201d the founders said. The show provided the validation that they were looking for and catapulted them into the high-growth trajectory. The opportunity also helped the startup unlock the world of really good deals, reassuring them that they were building something scalable. Notably, this was also the year (FY23) when the startup generated a total revenue of INR 4.93 Cr, achieving profitability with a PAT of INR 18.71 Lakh. Operating in a market filled to the brim with water and waste management challenges, Solinas\u2019 key USP is its complete product stack.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe not only provide hardware but also software solutions to analyse data. This end-to-end capability sets us apart in the market,\u201d the founders said.\u00a0 Overall, the startup competes with Bandicoot robot parent Genrobotics, which is about three years older than Solinas. Bandicoot has also seen heavy backing from the Kerala government. It is engaged in culling various manual scavenging activities across 14 states in India, including UP, Maharashtra, and Punjab. The company is also exploring international markets, particularly in Dubai and Malaysia. Recently, in May this year, the startup  raised an undisclosed amount of funding from Neev Fund II , a fund managed by the State Bank of India\u2019s private equity arm SBICAP Ventures. The funding round also saw participation from fintech unicorn Zerodha\u2019s Rainmatter Capital. In the short term, the startup plans to use the funds to strengthen its water pipeline and sanitation infrastructure to drive climate change adaptation and sustainability. As of now, the startup is working hand in glove with the municipal corporations of Aurangabad, Nagpur, Mumbai, Pune, Coimbatore, Chennai, Bangalore, and Mangalore. However, a pain point of working with government departments is that their budgets are quite skewed. While the startup may not feel any additional burden in the short term, a long-term association with departments that separately miserly may not bode well for Solinas. Edited By Shishir Parasher",

        "Article Content": "India\u2019s beauty and personal care (BPC) brands are looking good and growing fast, riding a wave of consumer trust, investor enthusiasm and product innovation. Per a Redseer-Peak XV estimate, the Indian market will see the   highest CAGR of 10%  from 2022-2027, outpacing China and the US with much bigger per-capita spending on BPC products. In fact, India may account for nearly 5% of a $660 Bn global market by then, soaring to $30 Bn from $19 Bn in 2022. Despite the waves of change, the funding scenario is not dismal, either. BPC startups  raised more than $1 Bn  between 2014 and H1 2024, with hundreds of brands eyeing the market.\u00a0 As new ventures grew, especially after a D2C (direct-to-consumer) deluge since the pandemic, can BPC brands set new trends and thrive in a crowded market? Or will they glow briefly and quietly fade away, shuttering businesses or falling prey to consolidation?\u00a0 However, one-year-old  Hyphen , a personal care venture and a sister brand to mCaffeine, is apparently in a class of its own. For PEP Technologies, the parent of mCaffeine, launching a second venture in the same space almost after a decade was more of a strategic move to create differentiated value rather than drive business momentum. It is evident that  MCaffeine  is a distinguished brand with a valuation exceeding $119 Mn+ and $40 Mn+ funding in its kitty. It conducts business across 18K pin codes via a strong omnichannel presence and has sold more than 10 Mn products since its launch in 2015. It has also captured 65% of the body care market in India, the brand claims. The only issue: All its products have been anchored in the power of caffeine. Unsurprisingly, the founding team had to cope with two major tasks to stay relevant in a space where cult products often debut on social platforms, via influencer marketing, and obsolescence sets in if fresh formulations and new ingredients are missing for long. Clearly, a new brand was needed to preserve the USP of the mCaffeine product line and bring in a different range of ingredients and products so that users \u2018have it all\u2019.\u00a0 \u201cAfter building mCaffeine for years, we knew that the brand has a specific appeal and use cases. Stretching it too far [in terms of product add-ons not corroborating with its key theme and ingredients] could kill it. So, we decided to launch another brand,\u201d said Tarun Sharma, cofounder and CEO of mCaffeine and Hyphen.\u00a0 Actor  Kriti Sanon  also joined the leadership team as a cofounder and works diligently as the chief customer officer, looking after product reviews and responding to user queries. Hyphen offers 21 SKUs for comprehensive facial care, including cleansers, moisturisers, serums, sunscreens, lip balms and anti-pigmentation products. It claims that its offerings are 100% vegan (does not contain any animal extracts or by-products), cruelty-free (not tested on animals). On the other hand, mCaffeine mostly produces a body care line, including body scrubs and body washes, among others.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For now, Hyphen products are only available online across major marketplaces, quick commerce platforms and its own D2C website. It claims  annualised gross sales of INR 100 Cr by July 2024,  a user base of 1 Mn and reaching 20K pin codes by leveraging mCaffeine\u2019s distribution network. The brand has also received an infusion of INR 30 Cr from its parent company, PEP Technologies, which holds a majority stake in the business.\u00a0\u00a0 The concept of Hyphen started taking shape in 2021 when Tarun Sharma and Vaishali Gupta identified a critical gap after extensive conversations with hundreds of mCaffeine users.\u00a0 Although naturals (ingredients extracted from plants and vegetables) became popular around 2013-2014, users were doubtful about their long-term effectiveness. The alternatives are lab-made ingredients (actives) with proven functionalities, as they undergo extensive trials regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other similar organisations across countries. However, long-term use of these chemical products was also perceived as harmful as customers leaned towards the therapeutic power of natural products during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThe product line of mCaffeine is based on natural formulations. We stick to ingredients derived from coffee, tea and chocolate and supplement them with glycerides and vitamins. But given the evolving mindset of consumers who wanted the best of both worlds, the challenge was to find a proper balance, blending the benefits of naturals and actives into a single product,\u201d Sharma told Inc42.\u00a0 The cofounders and their R&D team went all out to fuse nature with science to address complex facial care needs.  After two years of research, endless internal debates and 18 months of trials and errors to perfect the formulations, Hyphen was launched with a sunscreen, a face serum and two moisturisers. Although mCaffeine and Hyphen have an identical sourcing strategy and rely on top-grade Indian suppliers, the latter has  a broader mix of ingredients, a different production process (as its product line and formulations differ from mCaffeine) and a rigorous 32-point quality testing system similar to its sister brand, ensuring that every product meets exacting standards from sourcing to manufacturing.  As Hyphen harmonises potent actives with soothing naturals, it is positioned as a performance-driven and science-backed solution provider that can optimise quality. Its products are priced at a 10% premium over mCaffeine due to the extensive research involved. Sharma emphasised that Hyphen\u2019s competitive edge lies in successfully implementing its business basics. \u201cIn the actives space alone, you will find more than 30 brands. But those who succeed stick to the core principles, execute them well and create differentiation. Many brands failed despite unique propositions because their execution fell short.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hyphen has a robust R&D team and a sound range of products containing tea tree extract, avocado oil, peptides, retinoids, ceramides, alpha arbutin, kojic acid and azelaic acid, which serve as powerhouse ingredients for facial care. But reaching the INR 100 Cr milestone could not be a walk in the park.\u00a0 In the first few months, the brand encountered what most newcomers do \u2013 not enough visibility and, hence, the lack of fast growth naturally expected with a sister brand like mCaffeine thriving for years.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cInitially, we were banking on tremendous organic growth, relying on PR and word-of-mouth. Of course, the new brand resonated with some consumers, but we somewhat stagnated within the first six months,\u201d said Sharma. For context, Hyphen clocked INR 30 Lakh in gross sales in the first month (July 2023) and doubled in the third month to INR 60 Lakh. But by then, the promoters were worried about a few anomalies in consumer discovery and desires.\u00a0 Interestingly, the repeat purchase rate in those early days was nearly 100%, underscoring the brand\u2019s effectiveness. But the business badly needed new footfalls to grow its customer base. The team also found that the initial buzz stemmed largely from Sanon\u2019s strong social media presence. Given these insights, Sharma and his team realised that the brand\u2019s value proposition, products and pricing worked well, but they needed to focus on the missing pieces \u2013 promotion and business operations. It was decided to position Hyphen as a celebrity-led brand as an mCaffeine-like branding would not align with the new entity\u2019s brand\u2019s ambition and target audience. The goal was to see it emerge as a top-selling skincare line and hit the INR 100 Cr milestone at the earliest.\u00a0 By January 2024, the team ramped up their efforts and adopted the strategic blueprint originally developed for mCaffeine. According to Sharma, Hyphen\u2019s rapid success \u2013 from INR 30 Lakh to INR 14 Cr in FY24 and then to INR 100 Cr annualised gross sales in July 2024 \u2013 would not have been possible had they not replicated three critical strategies from mCaffeine\u2019s playbook. Here is a quick look at the fundamentals: Nurturing consumer centricity:  Like mCaffeine, Hyphen has a consumer-centric approach from the beginning, and the leaders quickly realised how repeat customers were driving its growth in the initial months. Today, 60% of Hyphen\u2019s sales come from repeat customers and the average product rating exceeds 4.5 out of five. It has also captured double-digit market share in sub-categories like lip balm. \u201cWhat makes this new brand relevant to the consumer? Why would they choose your product over millions? It\u2019s because staying consumer-centric is fundamental, it\u2019s non-negotiable,\u201d said Sharma.\u00a0 \u201cWe keep the 3Cs in mind. We listen to our  consumers , build the right  categories , and expand  channels  for easy access. We learnt it when building mCaffeine from scratch and distilled our learning into these core principles. They have taught us how to deliver top-notch products backed by flawless execution.\u201d Targeting time-bound opportunities:  Another key takeaway from mCaffeine is seizing time-sensitive opportunities with calculated energy and precision. Hyphen\u2019s strategic approach to distribution \u2013 knowing when and where to launch \u2013 is a case in point.\u00a0 Elaborating its selective approach, the CEO said the brand could not be spread too thin across all distribution channels. Plus, the team had to time it right about starting Meta ads, Google ads and WhatsApp campaigns. Again, the brand won\u2019t enter offline retail until Hyphen hits the INR 400 Cr mark, as traditional retail is expensive.\u00a0 \u201cWe are very data-focussed. We analyse the numbers every time before choosing the best channel/s,\u201d said Sharma. For example, quick commerce was not a good fit for Hyphen in the early days. But as the landscape shifted, the brand was launched on quick commerce platforms this year. Mastering the 6Ps:  The leadership\u2019s journey at mCaffeine brought home the art of mastering the 6Ps: Proposition, product, packaging, pricing, platform and promotion. \u201cIf you can nail these, the 7th P \u2013 profit \u2013 will follow,\u201d said Sharma. Several factors keep Hyphen aligned with the 6Ps mantra. Its value proposition \u2013 the right mix of naturals and actives for best outcomes \u2013 has resolved customer pain points at the product level. Ingredients are directly sourced for consistency in quality. A 16-member R&D team is in charge of developing the formulations in-house. And its QA/QC personnel are stationed at partner manufacturers to maintain rigorous quality standards. Despite outsourced manufacturing, the brand retains tight control over every detail.\u00a0\u00a0 Hyphen has in place comprehensive SOPs for all its processes and further benefits from the expertise of advisory formulators, many of whom are former Unilever professionals with 20-25 years of experience.\u00a0 Additionally, it has minimised packaging costs and funnels 80% of its budget on procurement to ensure competitive pricing without sacrificing quality.\u00a0\u00a0 Finally, pricing has been carefully worked out, keeping in mind a cost-sensitive market. Hyphen\u2019s products are positioned as mass-premium and cost 30-50% lower than similar companies like Laneige, The Ordinary, Inde Wild, Rhode. The founding team at Hyphen aims to scale the brand to INR 1K Cr. But this may sound too ambitious at this point. The D2C personal care brand is not yet profitable at an operational level, although it is unit economics positive. Plus, it is burning cash due to its ongoing investments in team, technology and R&D. Its short-term goals are clear, though. The brand eyes operational profitability by FY26 and wants to clock INR 200 Cr in revenue.  In the current financial year (FY25), it plans to focus solely on the domestic market and aims to become a bestseller brand across popular categories like sunscreen, serum and moisturiser. It will also move into new categories (which resonates with Hyphen\u2019s core values), driving repeat purchase rates and diving deeper into Tier II and III locations. Sharma says these will be crucial steps towards achieving the INR 200 Cr mark. Can Hyphen achieve its lofty ambitions in a competitive market and within a tight timeframe? It may not be impossible. Take Minimalist, a beauty and skincare brand that reached INR 100 Cr in revenue just eight months after its launch. [Edited By Sanghamitra Mandal]",

        "Article Content": "Green hydrogen, often called the fuel of the future, is quickly becoming a reality across the globe. India, too, is working to keep up with the shift towards alternative fuels.\u00a0 Amid this, green hydrogen is being touted to have a wide range of applications, from road transport and aviation to industrial processes. For the uninitiated, green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power, to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The result is hydrogen without a carbon footprint, with water as the only by-product. While hydrogen research began in the 19th century, practical applications didn\u2019t take off globally until the 20th century.\u00a0 The focus on green hydrogen is a more recent development, driven by the worldwide push to lower CO2 emissions and meet net-zero targets. With India aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the government approved  the National Green Hydrogen Mission in 2023, allocating INR 19,744 Cr.  The mission aims to develop the capacity to produce at least 5 Mn metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen annually by 2030. Sensing the shift in the global energy market, Bengaluru-based cleantech startup  Newtrace  has entered the scene at just the right time. Founded in 2021 by Prasanta Sarkar and Rochan Sinha, Newtrace has built an electrolyser technology that can enable green hydrogen production and its application at a lower cost. While a few other top conglomerates, including Adani Group, Reliance, and L&T Electrolysers, are also aiming to build green hydrogen electrolysers, Newtrace claims that its proprietary, patent-pending membrane-less electrolyser technology gives almost 99.9% pure hydrogen at the lowest capex (60% reduced cost). It is pertinent to mention that if the startup can maintain this benchmark while scaling up, it could become one of the leading names in the country\u2019s domestic hydrogen market, as well as the export market, in the coming years. Also worth mentioning is the fact that the global demand for green hydrogen is expected to cross the 100 MMT mark by 2030. Sarkar and Sinha, both PhD scholars from prestigious global universities, had no intention of settling in India. However, when the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, they found themselves stuck in the country. As fate would have it, they eventually crossed paths for the first time at an event organised by Entrepreneur First in Bengaluru.\u00a0 The scholar duo synced on the fact that both were driven by the motivation of tackling climate change problems. However, riding the trend of India\u2019s IT services market, the two started working on building a software company, a material informatics platform. Within a year, the duo chose to pursue their true calling and started working on the electrolyser technology for green hydrogen in June 2021. After building the technology, they incorporated Newtrace in October 2021.\u00a0 \u201cWhen we started building our first electrolyser from our apartment in Bengaluru, everybody had only heard about hydrogen from Elon Musk, and the first question was  Gaadi kitni kilometres chalegi?  (How much mileage can hydrogen cars give?),\u201d cofounder and CEO Sarkar said.\u00a0 He, however, added that they were looking beyond mobility. \u201cWe were looking at applications at refineries \u2014 for the processing of steel or cement, and ammonia for fertilisers.\u201d There were not only misconceptions and a lack of knowledge around the role of hydrogen as a molecule but also inhibitions around a startup\u2019s ability to enter this space, he added. By the end of 2021, the Newtrace founders found their first home in IIT Madras. After doing a proof of concept (PoC) for its first electrolyser, MARK 1, Newtrace started working on a lab prototype of the electrolyser with the help of Dr Satyanarayanan Chakravarthy at the university. Since then, there has been no looking back. In the last three years, the startup has made significant progress in coming out with three versions of its electrolysers \u2014 MARK 2 (a 1kW stack), MARK 3 (a 10-100 kW fully automated system), and MARK 4 (a 100-500 kW system). For context, a 10 kW electrolyser produces around 4 kg of hydrogen per day. Notably, the startup\u2019s MARK 4, with a 10 kW stack (which can be increased to 500 kW as per requirement), is already being piloted by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL). Sarkar explained that there is a growing demand among refineries for hydrogen to process crude oil. Besides, everybody in the oil and gas industry is looking to produce hydrogen in a decentralised manner and then supply it as fuel for the next generation of mobility solutions, he said. Hence, Newtrace is currently looking to largely tap the players in the oil and gas industry. It is soon making its next commercial deployment with ONGC Energy Center. The startup is also exploring the deployment of its electrolysers in the steel sector. Sarkar believes that it will take long before hydrogen becomes popular in mobility; hence, it is not a major focus for the company yet. Helped by its innovation and technology, Newtrace has also garnered significant investor attention. It became a part of Peak XV\u2019s Surge 09 cohort in 2023.\u00a0 The startup  raised $5.65 Mn in its Seed funding round  from Peak XV, Aavishkaar Capital, Speciale Invest, Micelio Fund, and a few other angel investors last year. Besides, it\u2019s also one of the beneficiaries of the Indian government\u2019s production-linked incentive (PLI) for setting up 30 MW/year electrolyser manufacturing. It started generating operating revenue in FY24. So far, Newtrace has deployed and secured orders worth $300K.\u00a0 Before we dive deeper, it\u2019s important to understand that using hydrogen in industrial processes in India isn\u2019t new. According to government data, around 5 MMT of grey hydrogen is used annually in the country, with 99% of it going towards petroleum refining and making ammonia for fertilisers. Grey hydrogen is produced by burning fossil fuels like natural gas and coal. A report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) showed that by the end of 2021, about 47% of global hydrogen production came from natural gas, 27% from coal, 22% from oil (as a by-product), and only 4% was made using electrolysis. One of India\u2019s key goals in its Green Hydrogen Mission is to replace grey hydrogen with green hydrogen to lower carbon emissions and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. However, the high cost is a major obstacle. Newtrace\u2019s technology aims to solve this. While traditional electrolysers (such as alkaline water, anion exchange membrane, proton exchange membrane, and solid oxide electrolysers) cost between $1,200 to $3,000 per kW, Newtrace\u2019s membrane-less electrolyser brings that down to just $1,000 per kW. While Newtrace develops its own electrocatalyst, different vendors manufacture the other parts of the electrolyser based on Newtrace\u2019s design. The final assembly is done by Newtrace, with each electrolyser costing between INR 1 Cr and INR 3 Cr, depending on its size. As the startup\u2019s commercial deployments pick up pace, it is now focussing on larger industrial applications with mega-sized electrolysers rather than smaller projects.\u00a0 The startup is building a 1 MW electrolyser system, which it plans to start deploying early next year, followed by even larger units, which will include 5 MW and 10 Mw systems. Soon, as the company scales and with the PLI in place, it will have a capacity of 30 MW per year. To support this growth, the founders are planning to set up a new manufacturing facility in Bengaluru next year, which will enable large-scale production of electrolysers. In addition to this, the startup is looking at global expansion starting next year.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of appetite in the Middle East for electrolysers and green hydrogen production. Then there are countries like Japan also that have started looking at it. We want to complete the development cycle and demonstration cycle in India first, and then go out to explore other geographies,\u201d Sarkar said. To fund its global expansion and manufacturing, Newtrace has set its eyes on raising a \u201csubstantial amount\u201d in the next six months.\u00a0 However, the startup is currently faced with a few challenges, including reducing the current two- to three-month timeline for deploying commercial orders. Also, the cleantech startup could face headwinds from fluctuations in demand and rising competition from large enterprises.\u00a0 For now, with access to India\u2019s first industrial-scale demonstration of membrane-less electrolyser technology, can Newtrace lead India\u2019s green hydrogen ambition?",

        "Article Content": "The Indian startup ecosystem is booming and buzzing with innovation and energy, with it growing awareness of the need for environmental responsibility.\u00a0 From renewable energy to waste management and sustainable agriculture to eco-friendly transportation, Indian startups are leveraging technology and creativity to develop solutions that mitigate environmental harm and contribute to the country\u2019s economic growth.\u00a0 This shift is not just driven by ethical considerations but also by the realisation that sustainability can be a major driver of innovation and economic growth. India\u2019s startup landscape has seen a significant rise in green startups addressing various aspects of sustainability. As the demand for sustainable solutions grows, so does the need for green finance.\u00a0 These startups seek funding from sources that prioritise environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria, including impact investors, sustainable investment funds, and green bonds.\u00a0 This access to capital is crucial for accelerating the growth of the green economy. By aligning their financing with their sustainability goals, green startups can accelerate their growth, expand their impact, and contribute to the transition towards a more sustainable economy. Sustainable transportation startups in India are revolutionising the way people and goods move while minimising environmental impact. These startups are at the forefront of developing electric vehicles (EVs), building charging infrastructure, and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as cycling and shared mobility services.\u00a0 Since 2015, Indian EV startups received $2.6 Bn in investments. Initially, most funding went to OEMs, but now investors are looking at areas like EV financing, charging infrastructure, and battery tech. From electric cars and scooters to electric bicycles and rickshaws, sustainable transportation startups are providing consumers with affordable and eco-friendly alternatives to traditional modes of transportation.\u00a0 Shared mobility platforms are making EVs more accessible through rentals and subscription services. Additionally, companies are tackling the crucial infrastructure gap by building robust charging networks across cities. Through technological innovation, partnerships with government agencies, and collaborations with industry stakeholders, these startups are driving the transition towards a more sustainable transportation system in India, paving the way for cleaner air and a greener future. Agriculture is another sector undergoing a transformation towards sustainability. The Indian agriculture sector faces challenges like water scarcity and soil degradation.\u00a0 Agritech startups are offering solutions that promote sustainable farming practices. Startups are connecting farmers directly to consumers, reducing food waste and improving market access and are developing technologies for precision agriculture, which helps farmers use resources more efficiently. Startups are leveraging technology to promote organic farming practices, reduce chemical inputs, and optimise water usage. Smart irrigation systems, precision agriculture technologies, and farm-to-fork supply chain solutions are empowering farmers to adopt sustainable practices while improving productivity and profitability. While the momentum towards a greener India is encouraging, startups in the sustainability space face several challenges. These include funding constraints, regulatory hurdles, market penetration barriers, and the need for scalable business models. However, these challenges also present opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and growth. Investors are increasingly recognising the potential of green startups and are willing to support impactful ventures that align with environmental and social objectives. Moreover, partnerships with corporations, NGOs, and research institutions can provide startups with access to resources, expertise, and market networks, enabling them to scale their operations and maximise their impact. The Indian government has recognised the importance of fostering a conducive environment for green startups. Initiatives such as the Startup India program and schemes promoting clean energy and sustainable development are providing financial support, incentives, and regulatory frameworks to encourage innovation in the green sector.\u00a0 Schemes like the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME-II) and the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020 directly incentivise the adoption and production of EVs, creating a market for green startups in this sector.\u00a0 In the fiscal year 2023-24, the government spent INR 4,807 Cr under the FAME India scheme. For the fiscal year 2024-25, INR 2,671 Cr has been allocated under the FAME scheme. Furthermore, the government is promoting green finance through initiatives like the Green Bonds framework and the NABARD Green Refinance Scheme, making capital more accessible for sustainable businesses. Collaborations between government agencies, academic institutions, and industry stakeholders are fostering research and development in sustainable technologies and promoting knowledge exchange and capacity building. India\u2019s startup ecosystem is at the forefront of driving innovation and change towards a greener and more sustainable future. With a diverse range of startups addressing environmental challenges across various sectors, the country is poised to become a global leader in sustainable development. By nurturing entrepreneurship, fostering collaboration, and leveraging technology and innovation, India can unlock the full potential of its startup ecosystem to build a cleaner, healthier, and more prosperous nation for generations to come.\u00a0 With a collective commitment to sustainability, India\u2019s startups are not only shaping the country\u2019s future but also inspiring positive change on a global scale.",

        "Article Content": "India is one of the largest energy-consuming countries in the world, and the nation\u2019s energy needs are only going to increase with time. Having foreseen this a decade ago, the Union government had set a target of installing 100 GW of solar power capacity in the country by 2022. Although the deadline has now been extended to 2026, the seriousness for solar rooftop installations, which are supposed to account for 40% of the total solar energy generation, runs unrestricted among industry stakeholders, including climate tech entrepreneurs. Even the government of India has taken it a step further with the launch of PM Surya Ghar Yojana, which aims to help up to 10 Mn families across India install rooftop solar panels. In line and drawing support from the government\u2019s vision of building a solar energy surplus nation is  SolarSquare  Energy, a full-stack rooftop solar solutions startup founded in 2015 by Neeraj Jain and Nikhil Nahar. Shreya Mishra, the third cofounder, joined the startup in 2019-20. The startup initially commenced operations with B2B rooftop solar solutions. However, the founders later realised that the residential market, comprising housing societies and individual homes, had immense untapped potential in the field of solar energy.  To harness this potential, SolarSquare ventured into the B2C segment in 2021. The startup is operational in 15+ Indian cities and has identified that cities with high population density, including Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Delhi NCR, possess high potential for the solar industry. Although SolarSquare is not a manufacturer of rooftop solar panels, this does not restrict the climate tech startup from offering full-stack support, which ranges from free inspection, installation and after-sales services. Notably, the startup procures solar panels from vendors like Premier, Navitas, Adani and Rayzon.\u00a0 Mishra told Inc42 that their customer onboarding process starts with a free consultation session with a SolarSquare team, which guides individuals through the entire solar energy harvesting journey.\u00a0 Included in this consultation is an instant virtual 3D design of a post-installation look. Once the startup gets a go-ahead from customers, it calculates the energy needs of a family before finally proceeding to install SolarSquare WindPro Mount, which is designed to withstand high-velocity winds and combat all weather conditions.\u00a0 \u201cOur IIT Bombay-certified product comes with a 10-year warranty and is 100% rust-proof,\u201d Mishra said. Speaking with Inc42 about why solar energy adoption has been a laggard in a Sun-surplus country like India, Mishra said that several misconceptions currently shroud this clean source of energy, and one of the most common rebuttals is that solar energy is not very efficient to power entire households.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot only is solar energy sufficient to power your entire home, it also helps you bring your electricity bill to almost zero. Additionally, solar is a one-time investment,\u201d Mishra added.\u00a0 A 2 to 3 BHK house with lights, fans, and a washing machine needs panels to support up to 3 KW of energy. This may go up to 5 KW in case a house has up to two air conditioning units. Notably, one solar panel can produce 0.5 KW of energy. Mishra told Inc42 that its team of solar experts does not blindly follow the one-size-fits-all approach and carefully calculates the energy needs of every family, including future requirements, before suggesting a final capacity. The startup offers a five-year maintenance package with every purchase, which includes monthly cleaning and quarterly preventive health checks of the solar panels. Beyond the period of 5 years, the startup charges an annual maintenance fee of INR 10,000.\u00a0 The startup caters to a wide network of 500 to 1,000 customers daily in every city it operates. Besides, it offers regular maintenance and repairs within 48 hours of receiving a complaint.\u00a0 In a bid to improve its after-sales service, the startup recently acquired PV Diagnostics, a consultancy solutions provider in the solar industry. According to Mishra, the acquisition will help the company deploy service teams across several cities.\u00a0 The acquisition came shortly after  it bagged INR 100 Cr  ($12.08 Mn) as part of its Series A funding round led by Elevation Capital and the US-based climate-focussed fund, Lowercarbon Capital.\u00a0 Mishra said that the startup\u2019s FY23 revenues stood at INR 100 Cr. The company is looking to double its revenues by FY25.\u00a0 According to the cofounder, they have successfully powered 10,000 homes and 100 housing societies so far. Despite this, the  entity has yet to emerge in the black.\u00a0 As 50%-60% of customers prefer EMI options, SolarSquare has forged partnerships with several banks. Interestingly, the monthly amount generated for a five-year EMI plan is close to the electricity bill of an average household.\u00a0 The startup does not take any down payment from its customers, as it is covered by the subsidy offered by the Indian government.\u00a0 Under PM-Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, the government provides a central financial assistance (CFA) of 60% of system cost for 2 KW systems and 40% of additional system cost for systems between 2 to 3 KW capacity.\u00a0 At current benchmark prices, this means INR 30,000 subsidy for 1 KW system, INR 60,000 for 2 KW systems and INR 78,000 for 3 KW systems or higher. Moving on, the startup claims to have harnessed 10%-20% of the rooftop solar market share across each of the cities it operates.\u00a0 Apart from SolarSquare, one of the key companies in this segment is Zunroof,  backed by  Godrej Investment Office , which specialises in solar rooftop design, installation, and management using technologies such as computer vision, AI and VR. Among the corporates, Tata Power has emerged as one of the key players. It offers a one-stop service for setting up rooftop solar, uses satellite images to assess the rooftop capacity of a property and maintains the panels. Speaking about competition in the solar rooftop space, Mishra said that several companies, including battery manufacturers, offer solar panels today. However, such companies have multiple channel partners, who make this market highly unorganised.\u00a0 She said that there are barely any companies in the space that offer end-to-end services, including post-purchase maintenance. It is these grounds that have helped SolarSquare stay relevant in the ecosystem.\u00a0 While SolarSquare primarily operates in major cities, accessing roofs remains a significant challenge, particularly for apartment dwellers. To address this, many emerging startups are introducing the concept of Digital Solar.\u00a0 This innovative approach allows users to contribute to larger solar projects, effectively reserving panels and earning discounts on their electricity bills proportional to the solar energy generated.  SundayGrids is one such company offering the option to invest in digital solar \u2013 a unit of a portion of a solar plant hosted online that can be purchased by investors Although the concept of Digital Solar has yet to gain active prominence in India, it presents a promising opportunity for urban residents and companies like SolarSquare to bank on for a more sustainable green future.\u00a0\u00a0 [Edited by Shishir Parasher]",

One such pavilion would be climate tech, which will be led by sustainability-oriented venture capital firm Peak Sustainability Ventures.\u00a0 At a time when enterprises are increasingly focusing on their carbon footprint and environmental issues have emerged as a key focus area owing to the increasing importance of the ESG framework, the pavilion will showcase the breakthroughs of young and aspiring entrepreneurs in this area.\u00a0 Going beyond traditional focus areas, it aims to broaden perspectives on some of India\u2019s major climate opportunities, including hydrogen, alternative fuels, energy storage, EVs, water management, green buildings, alt-protein and other pertinent areas.\u00a0 It is pertinent to note that the Indian and Southeast Asia (SEA) climate tech market was pegged at $102 Bn in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20% to reach a size of $350 Bn by 2030, as per \u2018The Essence of Climate Tech for India and Southeast Asia\u2019 report by venture capital firms Golden Gate Ventures and Ventureast. Commenting on the climate tech opportunity, Samir Shah, managing partner at Peak Sustainability Ventures, said, \u201cEnergy storage, biofuels, regenerative agriculture and hydrogen are promising sub-sectors. Over 22% of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions come from buildings. In this scenario, the development of green buildings and the substitution of cement and steel with alternatives such as bricks made of biofuel will be exciting.\u201d\u00a0 At the climate tech pavilion at the Startup Mahakumbh, the attendees can expect pitch sessions and 1:1 mentorship sessions. Besides, water.org will host a workshop on water and the Good Food Institute will host a workshop on Alt Protein.\u00a0 Shah said that senior leaders fr om IFC ( International Finance Corporation) , Dalmia Cement, NTPC, Arvind Mills,  Godrej, Waree Energies, and Ather will share their experience in the field of sustainability and explain how they work with startups to enable the climate tech ecosystem to thrive and prosper. \u201cSustainability will be a key part of India\u2019s story over the next decade, especially as India starts to play a more central role in the global sustainability landscape and in helping the world achieve its sustainable development goals. At an industry level, climate is one of the fastest-growing verticals within venture capital. The time for India to put sustainability at the forefront is here and now and the climate tech pavilion will serve as a catalyst for furthering the conversation on India\u2019s energy transition and sustainability journey,\u201d Shah said.\u00a0 The climate tech pavilion aims to create awareness and highlight that the sector has matured in the country now. \u201cWith companies in India building for the world, the sector is profitable and promises tremendous growth,\u201d Shah added.

        "Article Content": "Bengaluru-based electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure provider Bolt.Earth laid off employees from multiple teams earlier this week in a second restructuring exercise within four months, sources told Inc42. The sources attributed the layoffs to a cash crunch owing to the startup\u2019s failure to raise fresh funding and said the number of employees impacted by the latest restructuring exercise could be in the range of 70-100, or around 40%-60% of the startup\u2019s workforce.\u00a0 Bolt.Earth confirmed the layoffs with Inc42 in a statement but said the claims of it firing 60% of its workforce are \u201c highly exaggerated\u201d. \u201c While we have made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce, the scale of these layoffs was significantly smaller and was a necessary adjustment within our strategic realignment,\u201d the statement said, without disclosing the number of employees impacted. The startup said that the decision to adjust the workforce was a result of a strategic pivot towards focussing more intensely on its core business \u2013 charging network.\u00a0 Founded by  Jyotiranjan Harichandan and Mohit Yadav  in 2017, Bolt.Earth offers electric vehicle charging solutions for businesses, individuals, real estate companies, fleet operators, and the government. It is pertinent to note that the startup had three broad product categories \u2013 Operating System (OS) for electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, and fleet management system.\u00a0 However, Inc42 sources said that the startup has shut the OS and the fleet management system verticals.\u00a0 Confirming this, Bolt.Earth said, \u201c\u2026 we have decided to discontinue our OS System and fleet management system verticals. However, we remain dedicated to providing ongoing support to our existing OS and IoT customers, ensuring they continue to receive the quality service they expect from us.\u201d\u00a0 The sources cited above said that the layoffs impacted multiple teams, including product, marketing, and technology. However, the design team was the worst hit as it was completely dissolved.\u00a0 However, Bolt.Earth said that the layoffs  were limited to the product and technology teams involved with the OS and fleet management system segments.  \u201c It\u2019s important to clarify that other departments, crucial to our focused business strategy, were not affected by this decision,\u201d the statement said. The startup is offering 1-2 months of severance pay to the impacted employees.\u00a0 The latest round of layoffs came almost four months after the startup  fired around 15-20% of its workforce .\u00a0 Back then, its cofounders said the layoffs were restricted to the OS team. They attributed the decision to the uncertainty surrounding the Centre\u2019s FAME-II scheme.\u00a0 It is pertinent to mention that in October last year, Bolt.Earth announced  raising $20 Mn  in a funding round from Union Square Ventures, Prime Venture Partners, ITIGO Funds, among others. However, sources told Inc42 then that the round was closed in 2022. Responding to Inc42\u2019s queries on the delay in announcing the funding round, cofounders  Harichandan and Yadav told Inc42 in December last year that it was  a \u201cstrategic decision\u201d. Last year, Inc42 also learnt that Bolt.Earth was in talks with investors to raise about $50 Mn and had received a commitment of $30 Mn.\u00a0 Responding to a question about this funding round, Bolt.Earth, in the latest statement, said, \u201c We are actively engaged in discussions with potential investors. While we remain confident in our business model and the growing demand for clean energy solutions, we prefer to maintain confidentiality regarding the specifics of these discussions at this stage.\u201d The startup raised $4 Mn in its Series A funding round led by Union Square Ventures and Prime ventures.\u00a0 In terms of financial performance, Bolt.Earth\u2019s parent entity Revos Auto Tech Pte. Ltd reported an operating revenue of 1 Mn Singapore Dollars (SGD) (about INR 6.4 Cr) in FY23, an increase of 617% from SGD 142K (about INR 89 Lakh). However, its loss surged 209.7% to SGD 12.4 Mn (about INR 78.1 Cr) from SGD 4 Mn (about INR 25.2 Cr) in FY22.\u00a0 Bolt.Earth didn\u2019t disclose its financial numbers for FY24 but said  it \u201cachieved robust revenue growth\u201d during the year.",

        "Article Content": "Byju Raveendran is racing against time to save BYJU\u2019S. Once India\u2019s most celebrated tech entrepreneur, Raveendran & family, have seen a massive fall from grace and  BYJU\u2019S  is battling insolvency proceedings from multiple corners.\u00a0 Addressing employees this past week, Raveendran attempted to show that the company is  on track to overcome this tough period  after months of uncertainty.\u00a0 \u201cI want to remind all of you that we are still the largest edtech platform globally with 150 Mn students using our products and services every month. Despite the recent challenges faced, this organic user base has doubled over the last two years. Indeed, BYJU\u2019S is transitioning to a sustainable business model that serves millions of students across India and employs thousands of people,\u201d the CEO wrote to employees, several of whom have not been paid for months.\u00a0 This is not the first time that Raveendran has tried to rally employees to get behind the company, however, BYJU\u2019S is in a more precarious position than ever before.\u00a0 While the leadership has been out of India for most of the past year, the company is on the brink of bankruptcy. The odds are stacked against Raveendran and his wife and cofounder Divya Gokulnath, and it all seems to be going awfully wrong.\u00a0 But where did the BYJU\u2019S story begin? And will this saga have a bitter end with Raveendran being forced to relinquish the giant he built, and which many accuse him of bringing down as well. How did the highest valued startup in India at one time reach this nadir? It was 2010, and Raveendran was a noted teacher for the Common Admission Test or CAT, an exam one is required to take to enter the IIM B-schools.\u00a0 Raveendran began with classes at Jyoti Nivas College in Bengaluru\u2019s Koramangala area, and his classes were said to be running chock-full. So much so that Raveendran had to book stadiums and college auditoriums to teach thousands of CAT aspirants.\u00a0 These  \u2018Byju\u2019s\u2019 classes  were a rage in most of the southern Indian states, where convention came second to outcomes. Raveendran, a self-educated teacher and learner as he likes to call himself, had appeared for CAT and topped the exams twice. He is said to have received and rejected offers from the six IIMs between 2005 and 2007. Instead, he joined a UK-based firm where he worked for three years, before pursuing his calling as a teacher in 2010.\u00a0 By then, Raveendran had taken his individual brand and incorporated a company Think & Learn Private Limited to run operations. And two years after this journey began and with considerable attention surrounding his classes, Raveendran was introduced to Ranjan Pai, the chairman of the Manipal Group, and Infosys\u2019s former CFO Mohandas Pai, who also ran venture fund Aarin Capital.\u00a0\u00a0 Ranjan Pai and Mohandas Pai wrote the first cheque for BYJU\u2019S in 2013 for a combined stake of 26% and the juggernaut started rolling on.\u00a0 After that first investment, there really was no turning back. In fact, it\u2019s a theme we will revisit time and again when it comes to BYJU\u2019S Even though the early years for BYJU\u2019S were around offline classes, the startup launched its first smartphone app in 2015. By then more investors had joined the company\u2019s cap table. Aarin Capital invested in the $25 Mn Series B, before the company raised a massive $145 Mn in 2016, and another $70 Mn in the next year.\u00a0 Armed with more capital than most Indian startups see in their lifetime, BYJU\u2019S went about acquiring students by millions. Massive ad campaigns were launched featuring superstars such as Shah Rukh Khan, Mohanlal among others.\u00a0 Naturally, BYJU\u2019S was also a very attractive employer. It was offering unprecedented pay \u2014 at the time for Indian startups \u2014 and the company became a workforce and sales engine. Raveendran often threw people at the problem, employing basic graduates who could sell tablets preloaded with BYJU\u2019S courses\u00a0 By 2019, nearly a decade after Raveendran began his solo adventure, BYJU\u2019S was now a massive empire with more than 50,000 employees. Offices were set up in India, US, UAE and it seemed like Raveendran wanted a global domination in edtech.\u00a0 The growth was unparalleled and even the big corporate firms in India were a no match at that point. In fact, Raveendran was the poster child for the burgeoning Indian tech and startup ecosystem, making the covers of magazines across segments.\u00a0 The aggressive sales strategy was something that caught everyone\u2019s eye. Raveendran and other senior leadership often dealt with accusations of a high-pressure and somewhat toxic work environment. Between 2018 and 2019, the edtech decacorn reported a 173% increase in revenue from INR 500 Cr in FY18 to INR 1,366 Cr in FY19, becoming the first edtech startup to breach the INR 1,000 Cr mark.\u00a0 It also helped that the company raised nearly $650 Mn in 2018, and the resulting push on the growth side definitely put Raveendran in a league of his own. Despite the teething issues around the toxic work environment and a sales-first culture, BYJU\u2019S was on the up.\u00a0 The company was alleged to have hired a low-cost workforce to deliver emotional sales pitches to parents, and this strategy of tapping into the fear of missing out or FOMO was working well.\u00a0 However, many also wondered whether BYJU\u2019S was pushing its products on to unsuspecting parents in ways that could have severe legal implications.\u00a0 For instance, those who could not afford BYJU\u2019S tablets and courses were brought on board with EMI payments for surreptitious loans availed by BYJU\u2019S from NBFCs. Many parents claimed they were not aware of BYJU\u2019S signing them up for loans. The company faced a lot of hue and cry over this strategy, but its sales targets kept growing. This particular concern snowballed later on in the company\u2019s journey, as BYJU\u2019S had to re-recognise some of its past revenue and ended up showing higher loss and lower income for some previous years in 2021.\u00a0 But looking at 2021 would be jumping the gun a bit \u2014 the beginning of 2020 changed everything for edtech, and gave unicorns like BYJU\u2019S a misplaced hope about the future of online learning. The highs of these two years and the funding boom was soon followed by gloom.\u00a0 Even before the pandemic, the edtech story being sold to global investors was simple: India is a market of 150 Mn students and internet penetration is increasing due to cheap cost of mobile internet. Plus, Indian parents have always been willing to spend for education outside the classroom. . It wasn\u2019t just BYJU\u2019S selling the edtech dream \u2014 Unacademy, WhiteHat Jr (before the acquisition by BYJU\u2019S), Vedantu and a host of other startups had sprouted up to capitalise on the growing market. The pandemic sent this edtech brigade into overdrive.\u00a0\u00a0 But BYJU\u2019S was easily the biggest of the lot. It raised well over $1 Bn between July 2019 and October 2020. The pandemic effect and the zero interest rate policy across the world had brought in a whirlwind of investments. The valuation zoomed by more than 22x from 2017- 2021 and this was the mercurial growth no startup in India could match.\u00a0 Till date, BYJU\u2019S has raised more than $5 Bn in capital from over 120 investors. Meanwhile, Raveendran, his wife Gokulnath and brother Riju Ravindran still have a cumulative 22% stake in the decacorn once valued at $22Bn. At this point, Raveendran was far from the teacher and educator he was once known to be. Inc42 spoke to some employees who worked closely with the CEO during this hyper growth period.\u00a0 One such employee told us that as a CEO, Raveendran often wondered why student enrollments declined from time to time. When the CEO was told that rival companies were signing up these students, Raveendran apparently told his team to \u2018buy them all\u2019, the source added. Indeed, BYJU\u2019S was an acquisition machine. Between 2017 and 2021, BYJU\u2019S went on a shopping spree and acquired 17 companies within five years, which is a record three and a half companies every year \u00a0 \u201cThe hunger to throw money at everything and anything was well known within the company. Sales people were spending nights in the office to meet targets and get incentives. We brought new NBFCS on board for EMI customers. The pressure to perform grew so much that sales numbers being botched up did not surprise anyone. Even the finance team was not surprised when there were discrepancies. Everyone had to deliver like Raveendran wanted,\u201d a former senior manager told Inc42 about the months leading up to 2020.\u00a0 The biggest shock came when BYJU\u2019S former auditor refused to sign the audited FY22 results due to an alleged unethical accounting practice that would recognise unrealised revenues for a financial year on the account of sales made on the paper. The dodgy sales numbers came back to bite BYJU\u2019S later in life.\u00a0 Though how it escaped the notice of investors and auditors such as Deloitte for so many years still remains a mystery.\u00a0 Despite raking in billions of dollars, BYJU\u2019S focus was to appear on every TV commercial and sponsor every major event.\u00a0 It was already the biggest edtech company in the world, but it wanted to sustain the lead. In 2019, BYJU\u2019S signed up as the main sponsor for the Indian cricket team at a steep cost. The edtech giant agreed to pay INR 4.61 Cr per bilateral match and INR 1.51 Cr per match featuring India in an ICC event. It also splurged $40 Mn for being a sponsor of the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar, besides continuing to pay celebrities for endorsements.\u00a0 The company roped in football superstar Lionel Messi for a $5 Mn-$7 Mn per year deal for its non-profit arm. When this deal was announced in 2022, social media was swamped with outrage as the company laid off 2,500 employees just weeks before this deal.\u00a0 \u201cTo have the biggest superstar of Indian cinema like Shah Rukh Khan endorsing your brand for years on TV commercials is no small feat. They were spending crazy dollars. Every agency was chasing them. Everyone thought they are doing INR 10,000 Cr business every year,\u201d a Bengaluru-based ad agency founder told us.\u00a0 In public and going by the claims in the media, BYJU\u2019S seemed to be growing from strength to strength, but even by late 2022, the cracks had begun to appear. For one, the pandemic\u00a0 An internal crisis was brewing inside the company as parents questioned the quality of the online learning courses, and demanded refunds. This issue also became a matter of debate in the Indian parliament.\u00a0 While BYJU\u2019S wanted to project the image of an international edtech brand globally, back home it faced a big blot on its reputation with allegations of cheating students and parents, especially those from lower economic stratas. Besides this, many of its acquisitions were proving to be a burden rather than a boon. BYJU\u2019S wanted a presence in test prep, K-12, text books, language and coding skills, higher education and the offline learning vertical. While it got this through acquisitions, several of them tanked.\u00a0 WhiteHat Jr, bought at a cost of $300 Mn in August 2020, created a lot of initial buzz but the product-market fit fizzled out after the pandemic, and WhiteHat became a huge weight around the group\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0\u00a0 Industry analysts claim that at the time, the strategy was sound. BYJU\u2019S was cash-rich and instead of waiting for the market to be built, it went after startups. \u201cRaveendran\u2019s intent was twofold. First was to build a world-class edtech company and second to somehow reach that elusive INR 10,000 Cr revenue mark which will justify the big investments.\u201d Neither happened. By 2023, even after the high-profile $1 Bn acquisition of offline coaching giant Aakash Educational Services, BYJU\u2019S had not managed to live up to the expectations of investors.\u00a0 Aakash, which continues to hold promise today along with Great Learning, has wrested back most of the control from Raveendran and the parent company. Incidentally, BYJU\u2019S first investor \u2014 Ranjan Pai \u2014 is now the largest shareholder and is slowly disassociating from BYJU\u2019S.\u00a0 Great Learning, sources claim, is also looking at a buyback from BYJU\u2019S led by the company\u2019s cofounders. The fate of US-based Osmo and EPIC hang in balance as the creditors have hounded BYJU\u2019S to dissolve both companies to repay debt.\u00a0 \u201cWas Raveendran transparent with his investors when he went on these acquisition sprees? That is the question they have been asking. We cannot neglect their complacency too when there was an edtech boom especially when the biggest investors were from the US and BYJU\u2019S was looking to buy companies there,\u201d a veteran investor associated with BYJU\u2019S said.\u00a0 Empires fall. And that seems to be the fate for BYJU\u2019S too. Raveendran seemed to have it all at one point. But through reckless business planning, overambition and perhaps even some hubris, the giant is now in a punier state.\u00a0 After scaling back from online learning, shedding nearly 90% of its workforce and cutting costs for everything from office space to SaaS tools, BYJU\u2019S is a shadow of the force it once was. Investors have given up on the company in all likelihood, and the likes of Prosus are staring at  a $500 Mn loss from their bet on BYJU\u2019S .\u00a0 With just the offline learning vertical as a saving grace \u2014 along with some ownership in Aakash and Great Learning \u2014 BYJU\u2019S is in a tough spot that\u2019s about to get worse. The company is close to shutting down  nearly half of its 250+ BYJU\u2019S  Tuition Centre outlets.\u00a0 In a bid to control its expenses amid the ongoing cash crunch and legal troubles, the company has started sending notices to the head of its tuition centres for terminating lease contracts for the properties. The move is likely to result in it shutting 120 offline centres, sources told Inc42. Raveendran remains bullish though. In an email to employees this week (August 20, 2024) Raveendran claimed that the company is on the verge of a turnaround and investors are ready to back the firm in its journey The cofounder said the startup is on the brink of reversing the negative business cycle that began two years ago and with BYJU\u2019S 3.0, the company will offer an AI-driven, hyper-personalised educational platform that will be high on impact, but low on cost.\u00a0 However, not many believe this will be the case. \u201cRaveendran has many friends in the UAE and even some allies in the US. But slowly everyone is coming after him because this is how bad businesses meet their fate,\u201d the investor who worked with Raveendran during BYJU\u2019S heyday said.\u00a0 It is not like Raveendran did not try to repair the damage \u2014 he introduced leaner sales and business models, but it\u2019s all proving too little, too late. The corporate governance challenges persist and even if BYJU\u2019S figures out a way out of its current predicament, it will take a lot to get there.\u00a0 \u00a0 The BYJU\u2019S saga bears an eerie resemblance to another big corporate scam in India in the recent past, aka the Satyam Scam of 2009 where Byrraju Ramalinga Raju, the founder and CEO of the IT services company, was accused of syphoning off more than INR 7,000 Cr from the company coffers.\u00a0 Satyam\u2019s books and accounts showed profits that had never existed, while the company\u2019s share price surged, and Raju then sold shares for personal gains. Raju then confessed that the books were cooked, and six years later, he was among those found guilty by court and sentenced to imprisonment.\u00a0 But in BYJU\u2019S case, the outcome is uncertain. As the founder of an edtech skilling startup company puts it, \u201cThere are people chasing Byju Raveendran \u2014 from lenders, hedge fund managers to his own employees. But then India also has a bad track record when it comes to bringing wilful defaulters back to the country. It needs to be seen what the SC\u2019s will do after the insolvency proceedings.\u201d Despite an uphill task of convincing the country\u2019s top court, foreign lenders and investors to give him some more time for settling pending dues, Raveendran is in no mood to give up. His latest communication indicates just that. \u201cOver the past 29 months, [our] only source of capital was the founders. Founders together have infused approximately INR 7,500 Cr in the company for various operational needs. I guarantee this: When we regain control, your salaries will be paid promptly, even if that means raising more personal debt. We have investors ready to back our turnaround story. They see what I see \u2013 enormous potential and inevitable growth,\u201d Raveendran\u2019s email to employees said. However, thousands of employees have been promised many times over the last year and a half and are now contemplating fighting one more legal battle against Raveendran and his fallen empire.

        "Article Content": "Cloud-based waste management and processing startup  Recykal  has secured INR 110 Cr (around $13.2 Mn) as a part of its Pre-Series B funding round from 360 ONE Asset Management. This mix of primary and secondary investment also gave multi-bagger exit to its early stage investors, the startup said in a statement. Recykal\u2019s founder and CEO, Abhay Deshpande, said that this investment will enable the company to drive further innovation in technology, products and solutions. Founded in 2016 by Abhishek Deshpande, Hyderabad-based Recykal  offers cloud-based solutions to its clients that enables transparent and traceable material flows in waste. Deshpande, said, \u201cAs we embark on the next phase of our growth journey, this investment will pave the way for us to amplify our growth and strengthen our position as a trusted sustainability partner.\u201d \u201cThe company has demonstrated significant progress and scale in achieving circularity of value chain, as opposed to the traditional linear \u201ctake-make-dispose\u201d approach, by solving for demand aggregation and resource utilization, which we believe is imperative in building a sustainable future,\u201d said, Sameer Nath, CIO and Head of Private Equity at 360 ONE Asset. Till date, the company has raised a total funding of $35 Mn.\u00a0 In 2022, Recykal raised  $22 Mn  in a round led by Morgan Stanley India. The round also saw participation from a host of existing investors, including Circulate Capital, Vellayan Subbiah and Arun Venkatachalam. It is pertinent to note that the startup reported a net loss of INR 25.7 Cr in the financial year 2022-23 (FY23) as against a net profit of INR 1.2 Cr in FY22.\u00a0 However, its operating revenue jumped 291% to INR 745.1 Cr in FY23 from INR 190.4 Cr in the previous year. Including other income, Recykal reported a total revenue of INR 747.6 Cr in FY23 from INR 190.7 Cr in FY22. India\u2019s cleantech space has been gaining traction from a lot of investors for quite some time now.\u00a0 For instance, last month, cleantech startup  Bambrew raised INR 60 Cr (about $7 Mn)  in its Series A funding round led by Blume Ventures.",

Under the subsidiary, the startup is looking to optimise asset utilisation, ensure cost-effective operations for a successful transition to electric mobility, and minimise downtime for fleet operators or individual drivers.\u00a0 \u201cWith Amphion, we are poised to seamlessly integrate original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), charge point operators (CPOs), financiers, insurers, and recyclers into a cohesive ecosystem, driving efficiency and sustainability in the EV industry. We aim to be the leading EV asset management company not just in India but globally,\u201d Log9 cofounder and COO Kartik Hajela said.\u00a0 The development comes at a time when the adoption of EVs is on the rise in the country. The Indian EV market houses various small as well as large EV startups and is estimated to reach a size of $110.74 Bn by 2029.\u00a0 Besides the launch of Amphion, Log9 also unveiled Nexmile, a new battery designed for commercial EVs. It said Nexmile comes with a 5-year warranty, offers 3X charging speeds compared to other conventional batteries and has a full battery life to support 120 kms. Founded in 2015 by Haleja, Dr Akshay Singhal and Pankaj Sharma, Log9 manufactures EV batteries and other energy storage solutions. In the EV battery industry, it competes with the likes of Hero Electric-backed Exponent Energy and Ather Energy.\u00a0 Since its inception, the startup has raised nearly $65 Mn in funding. It last raised  $40 Mn funding in its Series B  round, led by Amara Raja Batteries Ltd and Petronas Ventures in January 2023.\u00a0 Log9 claims that it currently has 2,500 EV assets running on the road, connecting 600 charging stations. Besides, it manages INR 100 Cr worth assets for over 150 fleets with a turn around time of 2.7 days on servicing needs. It also said that it is growing at a 20-30% rate month-on-month.\u00a0 In February this year, Inc42 reported that Log9 laid off about  115 contractual employees . At that time, Sharma told Inc42 that the mass layoff was triggered due to automation, which led to reduction in the manual workforce. Further, the startup also delayed employee salary disbursement for the month of January. Sharma attributed the delays to cash flow disruption on account of lower production.\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "The recent  BYJU\u2019S battle  between the company\u2019s founders and its investors over the rights issue and corporate governance lapses is arguably the most high-profile tussle of its kind. But it\u2019s just the latest one in a long line of such battles.\u00a0 From  Snapdeal vs SoftBank  in 2017, to the major Flipkart sagas involving cofounder  Sachin Bansal and Tiger Global  in 2016, followers by the other  cofounder Binny Bansal and his fallout with Walmart  in 2018. And then there was  Bhavish Aggarwal\u2019s stand-off with SoftBank  in 2019 regarding a possible Ola-Uber merger.\u00a0 And now it\u2019s the turn of WestBridge Ventures which is clashing with Shaadi.com\u2019s founder over an alleged SHA clause violation, which grants the investor a mandatory exit from the company. WestBridge invested in Shaadi.com through the WestBridge Ventures II Holdings fund in 2006. Eighteen years later, the shareholders\u2019 agreement between the two parties is at the centre of a legal dispute across national borders and jurisdictions.\u00a0 The case was heard in the Singapore High Court, ICC Tribunal, Singapore Court of Appeal as well as being heard in Indian forums such as the Bombay High Court, NCLT, and NCLAT. Many say that this is a landmark case because it could influence future disputes as well, by: Founded by Anupam Mittal and his brother Anand Mittal in 1997, Shaadi.com (People Interactive (India)) has been one of the most popular online matchmaking platform in India and many other countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and have its presence in other countries including UAE, UK, and US. The company was heavily impacted during the Covid and after having registered profit of INR 8.5 Cr in FY21, it recorded a loss of INR 13.5 Cr in FY22. The company has not filed its FY23 financial statements yet, so we don\u2019t know whether Shaadi.com has been able to get back in the black after March 2022. \n Before we delve into the nitty-gritty of the case, let\u2019s first set the context and understand the nature of the dispute between the two parties. Back in 2006, Mauritius-based private equity fund WestBridge Ventures which has invested in over 150 companies in the last 20 years (with AUM in India having crossed $10 Bn), invested INR 166 Cr in Shaadi.com\u2019s parent company People Interactive (India). As a result, both the investor and the company entered into a series of agreements, including: According to the ASI petition copy filed in the Singapore High Court, clause 3.4 of the SHA granted WestBridge certain contractual rights, including exit rights by means of: Since 2017, the SHA\u2019s clauses have led to a dispute between Mittal and WestBridge, and it escalated as Mittal failed to offer an amicable exit to WestBridge.\u00a0 With the five-year obligation long overdue, WestBridge exercised its buyback option, mandating that the company convert its 1,000 Series A1 Preference Shares into 580,779 equity shares and buy back the said equity shares. According to the audit report seen by Inc42, while the company completed the conversion of the preference shares into 580,779 equity shares and allotted them to WestBridge on December 22, 2020, it could not complete the buyback. Shobhita Annie Mani, General Counsel, WestBridge was appointed nominee director in 2019.\u00a0 Subsequently, WestBridge issued a drag-along notice to the founders on October 8, 2021. This incidentally mandates that the group liquidate the shares of the minority shareholders including the founder and either buy them or sell them to a direct competitor.\u00a0 According to court filings, both parties had been fully committed to the agreement clauses until issues arose in 2017 when WestBridge entered talks with People Interactive competitor Info Edge to sell its shares.\u00a0 It\u2019s important to note that Info Edge runs another matchmaking platform Jeevansathi.com, which is a direct competitor to Shaadi.com. This is in compliance with the terms of the SHA, which say that if Shaadi.com fails to facilitate a buyback, the concerned investor is free to sell shares to anyone, including significant competitors.\u00a0 The drag-along rights could potentially jeopardise Shaadi.com in a very detrimental way, as it opens the path for Info Edge to execute a takeover.\u00a0 If Info Edge\u2019s Jeevansathi.com were to acquire the majority shareholding, it would mark the end of the road for the founders and promoters of Shaadi.com.\u00a0 According to Mittal\u2019s petition at the NCLT, while Mittal holds a 30% stake in People Interactive (India), WestBridge controls 44.3% of the shareholding. In this case, enforcing drag-along rights would mean that Shaadi.com\u2019s Mittal has to mandatorily sell his shares along with WestBridge.\u00a0 For context, as per  reports , BharatMatrimony.com has a market share of over 50-55% among matrimonial platforms, Shaadi.com has around 25-30%, and Jeevansathi.com holds about 10%. Given the potential impact on Shaadi.com, Mittal filed a petition in the NCLT and refused to provide consent to the sale of WestBridge as well as his shares to Info Edge. This initiated a legal battle between the two parties, spanning courts in two countries and involving at least half a dozen courts and quasi-judicial bodies. In its submission to the Singapore High Court, WestBridge says that the SHA makes it clear that the contract is governed by the laws of India. Further, Arbitration Proceedings were stated to be as per International Chamber of Commerce Rules and the seat of arbitration shall be Singapore.\u00a0 And, the enforcement of the award shall be subject to the provisions of Indian laws. Since People Interactive failed to comply with the SHA, WestBridge approached the Singapore courts seeking a permanent injunction, which was eventually granted by both the Singapore High Court and the country\u2019s Supreme Court. In his submission to the Singapore courts, Mittal stated that disputes related to oppression and mismanagement are not arbitrable because the NCLT has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate these disputes. Mittal has alleged that WestBridge colluded with the other directors of the company with the intention to wrest control of the management of the day-to-day operations of the Company in a manner contrary to the interests of the Company.\u00a0 Mittal further claimed that the disputes are contractual in nature as argued by WestBridge itself.\u00a0 The disputes referred to the NCLT fall outside the scope of the arbitration agreement, Mittal argued, and said that the arbitration agreement would be unworkable and liable to be declared void under Indian law. While both the Bombay High Court and the NCLT have not yet addressed the merits of corporate oppression and mismanagement, they granted Mittal interim relief from the injunction order based on these arguments.\u00a0 Now, the NCLT is set to hear the case on October 30, and the NCLAT will hear it on September 18, 2024.\u00a0 Multiple lawyers consulted by Inc42 believe that under Indian law, such disputes are not subject to arbitration, as the NCLT holds exclusive jurisdiction over them. However, under Singapore law, claims of oppression and mismanagement can be resolved through arbitration. Aaushi Doshi, associate partner at IndiaLaw LLP, explained that Singapore law is governed by the ICC (International Chamber of Commerce), and the arbitration agreement was subject to Singapore law. The parties have not only chosen to arbitrate, but have also chosen \u201cto arbitrate under Singapore law in Singapore\u201d in accordance with the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cICC\u201d). Therefore, it was within the jurisdiction of the Singapore court to consider claims of oppression through arbitration. Doshi added that the Singapore court adopted a broader interpretation. While this broader interpretation was not expressly consented to, the arbitration clause itself serves as express consent, establishing Singapore as the jurisdiction according to the terms of the agreement.\u00a0 The Singapore High Court noted that Mittal and other People Interactive directors violated a permanent anti-suit injunction issued by the court by starting proceedings with the NCLT, and then the Bombay High Court. The court maintained that since Singapore law is the governing law, the disputes between the parties can be arbitrated under this law, and even if Indian law governed the arbitration agreement, the dispute would still fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement. However, enforcing this would be complicated.\u00a0 Piyush Agarwal, a partner at Acquilaw, explained that Indian law is clear on this matter. This arbitration is contrary to the laws of India as intra-company disputes are non-arbitrable in India and hence enforcement would be difficult/refused as it is contrary to the public policy of India, he added.\u00a0 The NCLT has exclusive jurisdiction over these types of disputes, and no civil court has the authority to interfere in matters handled by the NCLT or the Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). Further, even if the Singapore Courts have imposed an anti-suit injunction against Mittal, the first issue is that the enforcement proceedings cannot be done in India which would be the case here, Agarwal told Inc42. This is something that the Bombay High Court also observed, \u201ca final award issued by the ICC Tribunal dealing with issues of corporate oppression cannot be enforced in India as such disputes are not capable of being arbitrated under Indian law, a recognised ground to resist enforcement of a foreign award under Section 48(2)(a) of the Indian Arbitration & Conciliation Act 1996.\u201d The case judgments have sparked discussions across startup ecosystems in the US, UK, Australia, Singapore, China, and many other countries, highlighting the pros and cons of such situations and exploring the appropriate legal remedies. An early-stage fund manager told Inc42, \u201cThis situation is quite typical for Indian startups, as very few go public within five years of funding. When this occurred, early-stage investors often had to wait 7-10 years to secure an exit. Fortunately, this has improved, with founders now better prepared to facilitate exits.\u201d In reviewing the case, there have been numerous instances where founders have failed to provide exits within the agreed timeline. However, such issues should ideally be resolved amicably, with both parties negotiating around the table.\u00a0 The fund manager added that while WestBridge must adhere to its contracts with LPs, actions should not come at the expense of the company\u2019s well-being. Unfortunately, the current case seems to have damaged the VC\u2019s brand to a certain extent.\u00a0 The case also presents how Singapore\u2019s judiciary has simply gone by the arbitration agreement and imposed a fine of $100K on Mittal and other directors for disobeying their judgement while the Indian judiciary bodies including NCLT and Bombay High Court have looked at the merits of their argument. The ICC tribunal judgement could have a severe impact on Shaadi.com by relinquishing the control of the promoters, and the cases of oppression and mismanagement will no longer be heard in India if the anti-suit injunction order is adhered to. While all eyes are now on the NCLAT which will look into the merits of the NCLT interim order, for startup founders and VCs, any adverse ruling could open a can of worms and a litany of litigations.

        "Article Content": "The clock is ticking on climate change. Businesses face immense pressure to reduce their carbon footprint, but traditional methods often lack precision and struggle to keep pace with complex operations. The climate economics index stress-tests reveal that climate change will impact 48 nations, encompassing 90% of the global economy, and evaluate their overall climate resilience. Major economic powers could face approximately a 10% reduction in GDP over the next three decades. If the temperature rises by 3.2\u00b0C, China is likely to experience a 24% decline in GDP by the middle of the century.\u00a0 Likewise, the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom are expected to suffer approximately a 10% loss each. Europe as a whole would undergo a slightly higher impact at 11%, with specific economies like Finland or Switzerland being 6% more vulnerable compared to France or Greece, which are at 13%. Here\u2019s where machine learning (ML) and predictive analytics emerge as game-changers, offering a powerful arsenal for businesses to significantly reduce their environmental impact. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, allows computers to learn from data without explicit programming. Predictive analytics, leveraging ML algorithms, analyses past data to forecast future trends.\u00a0 In the fight against climate change, this translates to pinpointing emission hotspots, predicting future carbon footprints, and optimising operations for maximum sustainability. Traditional methods might struggle to pinpoint the exact source of energy waste in manufacturing units. ML algorithms, however, can analyse vast amounts of sensor data, identifying machines with abnormal energy consumption.\u00a0 This empowers businesses to target specific areas for improvement, leading to significant reductions in energy use and carbon emissions. The power of ML extends beyond monitoring. Predictive analytics can forecast future emissions based on historical data and current trends. This foresight allows businesses to proactively adjust operations, invest in renewable energy sources, or optimise transportation routes to minimise their environmental impact before emissions even occur. Real-world applications abound. Buildings equipped with ML-powered systems can automatically adjust heating and cooling based on real-time occupancy and weather data, slashing energy consumption. According to the studies, building automation powered by AI can achieve energy savings of 10% to 30%. Logistics companies can leverage ML to design the most efficient delivery routes, reducing fuel use and emissions across their supply chain.\u00a0 The research found that optimising logistics routes with ML can decrease transportation emissions by up to 20%. Businesses can even utilise ML to identify sustainable sourcing options, ensuring their entire operation minimises environmental impact. The benefits are undeniable. By optimising operations, ML-powered solutions can lead to significant reductions in carbon footprint, often exceeding 20%. Reduced energy consumption translates to lower operational costs, boosting a company\u2019s bottom line.\u00a0 A study found that companies embracing AI for sustainability initiatives can achieve cost savings of 5% to 10%. Moreover, embracing sustainable practices enhances a company\u2019s reputation and gives it a competitive edge in a market increasingly focused on environmental responsibility. Data quality, access, and integration are crucial hurdles for the ML, Additionally, potential biases within ML algorithms necessitate careful design and implementation. However, these challenges are actively being addressed by climate tech companies and the continuous advancements in ML technology promise an even greater impact in the future. The integration of ML with the Internet of Things (IoT) holds immense potential. Imagine a network of sensors constantly monitoring energy use in real time, feeding data into ML algorithms that can make instant adjustments for optimal efficiency. This future holds the promise of a seamlessly sustainable business landscape. ML is a powerful tool that can revolutionise carbon reduction strategies. By embracing data-driven approaches and investing in ML solutions, businesses can significantly reduce their environmental footprint and pave the way for a more sustainable future. The time to act is now, and machine learning offers the key to unlocking a cleaner, greener tomorrow.",

It creates water from the air using only renewable energy sources like solar, waste heat, or biomass to produce renewable water. Uravu\u2019s working prototype can channel air into a chamber containing desiccants like Silica which absorb the water content in the air. Once the desiccant is fully saturated, heat is applied to it using solar energy to extract the water in liquid form, as claimed by the startup.\u00a0\u00a0 The water-from-air concept is not new, as many startups already operate in the space. But unlike Uravu, most of them use refrigeration as a method to condense air in the atmosphere, which is an expensive process with high energy requirements.\u00a0 Uravu\u2019s method uses a desiccant that is relatively less capital-intensive and energy-intensive and also requires much less maintenance. The desiccant used in the machine has a shelf life of around ten years, and the rest of the components are mostly conventional electronic components like fans and pipes, according to the startup.\u00a0 The water tech startup raised an undisclosed amount during a pre-seed funding round in December 2021 led by Speciale Invest.\u00a0 The startup plans to work with corporations on CSR efforts, and with government agencies like Jal Shakti, and MNRE, among others, to deliver clean drinking water to remote and rural areas in the country.\u00a0 Climatetech startup Varaha helps agricultural farmers adopt regenerative agricultural practices by producing carbon credits, which help grow revenue and decrease operating expenses.

        "Article Content": "It\u2019s the season of spring for startup IPOs. After a lull in IPOs in 2022 and 2023 due to geopolitical tensions, a raging funding winter, and macroeconomic pressures, startups are lining up in droves to list on the bourses in 2024.\u00a0 Ten new-age tech companies have listed on the exchanges so far this year \u2013 Go Digit General Insurance, FirstCry, Unicommerce, TBO Tek, Ola Electric, Awfis, ixigo, Menhood, TAC Security and Trust Fintech.\u00a0 In contrast, just five startups listed in the entirety of 2023 and three new-age tech companies made their way to the bourses in 2022.\u00a0 While most of the anticipated action on the IPO front in 2024 seems to have already culminated, the Indian startup ecosystem still has a few aces up its sleeves. Segment giant Swiggy, logistics major Ecom Express and coworking startup Smartworks are also eyeing a market debut in the next few months.\u00a0 But, what is emboldening the startups to revisit their IPO plans, a year after many of them shelved or postponed their plans? The answer is the thawing funding winter, a renewed push for profitability and a growing investor appetite for startup IPOs.\u00a0 Speaking with Inc42, angel investor Nikhil Parmar said, \u201cFirstly, many startups have matured to a point where they are ready for public markets, driven by strong growth, robust business models, and proven revenue streams. Additionally, favourable market sentiment and ample liquidity have made the stock market an attractive option for raising capital. Investor confidence is also a significant driver\u201d. Concurring with this, angel investing platform BizDateUp Technologies cofounder Meet Chandan said that the IPO spring has also been fuelled by investors looking to diversify their portfolio and the promise of substantial returns from tech-driven companies. What has also helped the ecosystem is the  bumper listing  of most of the new-age companies in 2024 so far. From TBO Tek and Awfis to GoDigit Insurance, Unicommerce and ixigo, all have listed at a premium and many have even seen healthy rallies post their listing.\u00a0 Non-institutional investors (NIIs) and qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) are seeing merit in backing the growing number of Indian startups making a beeline for the bourses. However, challenges remain.\u00a0 Investors are primarily focussed on profitable and sustainable ventures and are steering clear of loss-making entities. Awfis, which reported a profitable quarter after its listing, was an outlier in this regard. Additionally, strong corporate governance guardrails and compliance with existing regulations also seem to be on the top of investors\u2019 agenda.\u00a0 \u201cMarkets currently are receptive to IPO-bound companies with a good brand, decent unit economics and a clear path to profitability. Public markets are hungry for tech stocks and are welcoming good companies with open arms. So, it\u2019s only natural that more founders would want to take their companies public. This is a great sign for the ecosystem,\u201d said VC firm All In Capital\u2019s cofounder Kushal Bhagia. Parmar believes that the surge in IPOs amid the funding winter showcases the startup ecosystem\u2019s resilience and adaptability. It also reflects the growing maturity of the ecosystem.\u00a0 With this in mind, Inc42 has collated a list of all top Indian startups that have listed on the bourses in 2024 so far as well as those who plan to go for IPOs in the near term. Before we dive into the list, here are the latest developments from the Indian IPO landscape:  Latest Updates: Now, let\u2019s take a detailed look at the list:\u00a0 This is not a listing of any kind.

In October last year, the company was reportedly mulling seeking regulatory approval for a $500 Mn IPO.\u00a0 At the time, it was said that PayU had appointed Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America as advisors for the IPO, reportedly slated to happen by 2024-end.\u00a0 In\u00a0 November, the then interim Prosus CEO Ervin Tu said that PayU could be ready for a public listing in India by the second half of calendar year 2024.\u00a0 As per the Dutch investor\u2019s annual report, PayU India clocked a revenue growth of 11% year-on-year (YoY) to $444 Mn in FY24. However, this was lower than the 31% revenue growth reported in FY23 and over 40% jump it clocked in FY22. Founded in 2015 by Sameer Nigam, Rahul Chari and Burzin Engineer, PhonePe is India\u2019s biggest digital payments platform and accounts for nearly half of all Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payments processed in the country.\u00a0 Since its inception, it has morphed into a full-fledged financial services platform, offering a host of digital payment services, insurance products, and broking services to customers. The fintech major was acquired by ecommerce juggernaut Flipkart in 2016.\u00a0 Six years later, Flipkart parent Walmart set into motion its plans to hive off PhonePe as a separate entity and redomicile the fintech company back to India. In late-2022, PhonePe flipped back to its home turf, with an eye on listing on Indian bourses.\u00a0 However, in June 2024, a senior Walmart executive said that PhonePe\u2019s IPO could take a couple of years, setting the stage for a 2026 IPO. In August 2024, the fintech major\u2019s cofounder and CEO Nigam said that payments body National Payment Corporation of India\u2019s (NPCI) plan to cap the UPI market share of third-party app providers (TPAPs) was  hindering the company\u2019s plans from going ahead with its IPO . The fintech major saw its consolidated net loss widen 39% YoY to INR 2,795.3 Cr FY23. Revenue soared 77% YoY to INR 2,913.7 Cr during the year under review.\u00a0 A brainchild of Krishnan Ganesh and Meena Ganesh, Portea Medical is a healthtech startup that offers services such as maternal care, physiotherapy, nursing, lab tests, counselling and critical care.\u00a0 Backed by Accel, InnoVen Capital, Alteria Capital and British International Investment, Portea Medical has raised more than $92.3 Mn across multiple rounds till date. The healthtech startup filed its IPO papers in July 2022 for an INR 800 Cr IPO. As per its DRHP, the IPO then comprised a fresh issue of equity shares worth INR 200 Cr and an OFS component of up to 56.25 Mn shares. In April 2023, it received approval from the market regulator to go ahead with the public listing on the BSE and NSE. However, there have been no further updates on its IPO plans. Portea Medical posted a net loss of INR 53 Cr in FY23, up from INR 40 Cr in the previous year. Revenue from operations declined 3.3% YoY to INR 145 Cr during the year under review.\u00a0 A brainchild of Nishanth Dongari and Rohit Vadera, the startup manufactures electric bikes and scooters across multiple variants.\u00a0 It has raised more than\u00a0 $14 Mn in funding till date and counts the likes of Bennett Coleman and Company, Hindustan Times Media Ventures, Ushodaya Enterprises, among others, as backers.\u00a0 Setting its plans to become India\u2019s second listed EV player in motion, the startup, in August 2024, said it plans to list on the bourses in 2025.\u00a0 However, the startup continues to be a loss-making entity and reported a net loss of INR 9.3 Cr in FY23. Meanwhile, revenue from operations also declined 42% to INR 131.28 Cr from INR 225.98 Cr in FY22.\u00a0 Founded in 2015 by Vaibhav Khandelwal and Abhishek Bansal, Shadowfax is a logistics startup that offers hyperlocal and on-demand deliveries to businesses.\u00a0 The Flipkart-backed startup competes with the likes of Delhivery, Ecom Express, XpressBees, LoadShare, Ripple and Pickrr. It is also backed by the likes of Mirae Asset Venture Investments (India), IFC, Nokia Growth Partners, Qualcomm and Trifecta Capital. The logistics services startup is reportedly looking to raise INR 2,500 Cr to INR 3,000 Cr via its public market debut at a valuation of INR 5,000 Cr to INR 8,000 Cr. While there is no clarity on the timeline for the IPO, its promoters and investors have kicked off discussions with merchant bankers for the IPO. Shadowfax trimmed its net loss 19% YoY to INR 142.63 Cr in FY23. Meanwhile, revenue from operations jumped 42% to INR 1,415 Cr during the year under review from INR 990 Cr in FY22. Founded in 2016 by Neetish Sarda and Harsh Binani, Smartworks is a shared workspace provider that offers customisable coworking solutions for enterprises.\u00a0 The startup has raised $41 Mn in funding till date and is backed by the likes of Ananta Capital, Keppel Land and Plutus Capital.\u00a0 Taking the first step towards its IPO, the startup turned into a public company in July 2024 and changed its name to Smartworks Coworking Spaces Ltd from Smartworks Coworking Spaces Private Ltd previously. In August 2024, it filed its DRHP with SEBI for an INR 550 Cr initial public offering. As per its DRHP, the company\u2019s IPO comprises a fresh issue of equity shares worth INR 550 Cr and an offer for sale (OFS) component of up to 67.49 Lakh equity. It trimmed its net loss to INR 49.9 Cr in FY24 from INR 101.4 Cr in FY23. Operating revenue jumped 46% YoY to INR 1,039.3 Cr during the year under review. Swiggy commenced operations as an online food delivery platform in 2014. In 2020, it also entered the grocery delivery business with Swiggy Instamart.\u00a0 Now, the Bengaluru-based startup has begun diversifying beyond the quick commerce grocery business. Swiggy Instamart now also offers high-value products, allowing shoppers to order fitness and electronics devices.\u00a0 Swiggy filed its DRHP with markets regulator SEBI via the confidential pre-filing route for an IPO worth INR 10,414.1 Cr ($1.2 Bn) in April. The IPO will include a fresh issuance of shares worth INR 3,750.1 Cr (about $449 Mn), and an OFS of INR 6,664 Cr (about $799 Mn), as per regulatory filings.\u00a0 On top of that, Swiggy is also looking for an INR 750 Cr pre-IPO funding round. In August 2024, reports claimed that the company was targeting a valuation of $15 Bn valuation for $1 Bn to $1.2 Bn IPO.\u00a0 In the run up to the IPO, the family office of actor Amitabh Bachchan also picked up a minority stake in the company by purchasing the shares held by Swiggy\u2019s employees and early backers. Swiggy reportedly plans to utilise the proceeds from the IPO to bolster its footprint in the quick commerce space and expand its dark store network.\u00a0 Swiggy reportedly posted a net loss of INR 2,350 Cr in FY24, down 44% from INR 4,179 Cr in FY23. Revenue grew 36% to INR 11,247 Cr during the fiscal under review from INR 8,265 Cr in FY23. Founded by the husband-wife duo of Vibhu Agarwal and Megha Agarwal, Ullu Digital is a Mumbai-based OTT platform that deals with the distribution, promotion, exhibition, marketing and delivery of video content on its streaming platform Ullu.\u00a0 It filed its DRHP with the BSE SME for an IPO in February this year. As per the draft papers, the company\u2019s IPO would comprise a fresh issue of 62.63 Lakh shares and would not have OFS component. Ullu Digital plans to raise INR 135-INR 150 Cr via the IPO, which, if approved, would become the biggest SME IPO till date.\u00a0 The platform plans to use the net proceeds raised via the IPO to meet its expenses for production of new content, purchase of international shows, tech investment, and to meet the working capital requirements. While Vibhu Agarwal holds a 61.75% stake in Ullu Digital, Megha Aggarwal owns 33.25% of the company.\u00a0 In March 2024, the OTT streaming platform came under the scanner of multiple government authorities including SEBI, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) for allegedly selling \u201cpornographic\u201d content using school children. Founded by Deepanshu Manchanda and Shruti Gochhwal in 2015, Zappfresh is a D2C meat startup that supplies meat from farms to customers within 90 minutes.\u00a0 Taking its first step towards IPO,the startup converted into a public entity in April 2024 after dropping \u201cprivate\u201d from its name. As per its RoC filings, the company changed its name to DSM Fresh Foods Limited from DSM Fresh Foods Private Limited previously.\u00a0 The startup\u2019s parent filed its DRHP for listing on BSE SME in August 2024. Zappfresh\u2019s IPO will comprise a fresh issue of 59.06 Lakh equity, with no offer for sale component.

        "Article Content": "Electronic waste and battery recycling startup  Attero  has marked its foray into the direct to consumer (D2C) space with the roll out of an integrated e-waste consumer take-back platform called Selsmart. With this platform, the company aims to transform the e-waste recycling landscape and combat India\u2019s growing e-waste crisis, which is projected to reach 14 Mn tonnes by 2030, it said in a statement. Selsmart will enable consumers to schedule doorstep pickups of used electronic gadgets and appliances, and receive fair market equivalent prices in return. The company also said that this platform will provide full data security with top-of-the-line data wiping, degaussing and physical destruction processes. Besides, Selsmart will facilitate disposal of e-waste through Attero\u2019s recycling processes. Founded in 2008 by Nitin Gupta and Rohan Gupta, Attero offers recycling of the electrical and electronic devices. As one of the leading e-waste recyclers, the company claims to process 144,000 metric tonnes of e-waste annually at its Roorkee plant and plans to expand it to 415,000 metric tonnes in next five years. The company counts Kalaari Capital, Granite Hill Capital, IFC and Forum Synergies among its investors. Nitin Gupta, cofounder and chief executive said, \u201cSelsmart addresses the significant gap in household electronics disposal. We are aiming to establish Selsmart as India\u2019s largest consumer take-back platform and are forging partnerships with leading brands and OEMs to incorporate circularity & sustainability into their business models.\u201d This development comes on the back of the boom in India\u2019s D2C market, which is likely to  reach  a size of $100 Bn by 2025. The growth is contributed by the pandemic, higher internet penetration, growth of digital infrastructure and cost of living that have shored up the D2C brands. Most manufacturing and electric vehicle companies depend highly on lithium-ion batteries for their production. Banking on the rise of battery usage, Gupta  claimed  that the company is cash flow positive and growing exponentially, in September 2023. Attero claims to have clocked revenues to the tune of INR 300 Cr in FY23. With the new label introduced in the market, the Noida-based company now looks to achieve an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of INR 100 Cr, by collecting 14,000 metric tonnes of e-waste. By the third year, Attero is forecasting to make INR 1,000 Cr in annual recurring revenue, with 140,000 metric tonnes of e-waste collected. Startup nurturing platform India Accelerator has  floated  a new vertical to back businesses operating in the cleantech sector, by writing a cheque of INR 1.5 Cr to each startup via its Finvolve Accelerator Fund. Besides, it will also allocate INR 4.1 Cr to each startup through the Finvolve Seed Fund to support growing startups looking for expansion.",

        "Author Name": "Team Inc42",
        "Author URL": "https://inc42.com/author/teaminc42/",
        "Article Content": "In a major blow for Okinawa, the Delhi High Court (HC) has dismissed its plea seeking to restrain the Centre from recovering subsidies worth INR 116.8 Cr disbursed to the electric vehicle (EV) maker under FAME-II scheme. \u201c\u2026 The Court is unable to accept the contentions urged by the petitioners and therefore the present application is dismissed,\u201d read the HC order dated August 5. In May last year, the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) issued a notice to Okinawa to pay back the subsidies for allegedly violating domestic manufacturing mandates under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME)-II scheme.\u00a0 Okinawa\u2019s counsel Manish Bishnoi argued before the HC that the company is unable to \u201ccarry on\u201d the production of its EVs due to cash crunch and as such, sought interim relief from recovery of dues.\u00a0 The counsel also contended that the company\u2019s cash flows have come to a standstill and an insolvency petition against it is pending before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). He also said that the Centre\u2019s demand notice is posing hurdles for the EV maker to raise funds and obtain loans from banks.\u00a0 \u201cBishnoi contends that in case interim orders as sought are passed, the petitioner company shall be able to revive itself and start production in a smooth manner, which will help the petitioner company to get back on its feet\u2026 If no interim relief is granted, they will have no option to file for insolvency\u2026,\u201d read the order.\u00a0 Okinawa\u2019s counsel also referred to the undertaking given by additional solicitor general (ASG) before the HC in November 2023 that no coercive action would be taken against Okinawa during the course of the legal proceedings. In his counter, ASG N Venkatraman opposed the relief sought by the EV maker saying that Okinawa was in violation of rules specified for availing incentives under the FAME-II scheme. Venkatraman also argued that three original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), who also received similar demand notices from the Centre, have returned the subsidy amount.\u00a0 Greaves\u2019s Ampere, Amo Mobility and Revolt are the three EV makers who were also slapped with demand notices for flouting rules.\u00a0 \u201cHe submits that there are also other entities who are also facing similar demands from the government, and in fact, three of the OEMs have already returned the subsidy amount. Thus, granting any interim protection to the petitioners in such circumstances would set a wrong precedent,\u201d read the HC order.\u00a0 After hearing both sides, the single-judge bench of Justice Sanjeev Narula dismissed Okinawa\u2019s plea for interim relief.\u00a0 For the uninitiated, at least 50% of an EV\u2019s components needed to be locally manufactured to avail these subsidies. However, according to tests carried out by the International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT), Okinawa imported DC-DC converters, traction motors, onboard chargers, and wheel rims and buzzers in FY22 and FY23.\u00a0 \u201cIn the case of Okinawa, we found even the tyres, horns and seats were imported. Literally, the entire scooter. How could we pass it off?\u201d an MHI official told Inc42 last month.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the development is expected to have a major bearing on EV makers in the country, who are in the dock for flouting localisation mandates under the FAME-II scheme. For Okinawa, the negative press around the government looking to recover the incentives hit the EV maker\u2019s $100 Mn funding round.\u00a0 On top of that, Okinawa has been intermittently operating its manufacturing units for fulfilling some outstanding orders to avoid legal conflicts with its dealers. Earlier, Inc42 also reported that the  Centre\u2019s bid to claw back subsidies may lead to at least three to five OEMs shutting down operations  in the next few months and impacting more than 5,000 jobs.",

        "Author Name": "Inc42 BrandLabs",
        "Author URL": "https://inc42.com/author/brandlabs/",
        "Article Content": "There\u2019s something special about the  chatpata  (deliciously tangy) candies that will never fail to tickle Indian taste buds. Many of us are still besotted with mango and  imli  (tamarind) delights, so much so that these timeless flavours have found their way into chutneys, juices, curries and countless other dishes. Nostalgia hit him when  Vinay Kothari , an FMCG professional, stumbled upon some jackfruit candies at a roadside stall on a trek to the Western Ghats in January 2018. The familiar taste flooded his mind with long-forgotten childhood memories, and he left the place with bags full of those savoury candies.\u00a0 Upon his return, he booked a stall at a flea market and sold the entire stock in half a day. Overwhelmed by the response, he joined forces with his sister Raksha (an engineer by profession) to set up a new venture. The duo launched the direct-to-consumer (D2C) food brand  GO DESi  before the year was out. As its name suggests, the brand encourages consumers to embrace their  desi  roots and buy traditional candies in a variety of flavours, all made from fruit pulp and brimming with the natural goodness of jaggery used as a sweetener.\u00a0 GO DESi runs a 40K sq. ft manufacturing facility in Sira village and Bidadi near Bengaluru and collaborates with farmers, self-help groups, co-operatives and rural businesses to ensure a steady product flow. These tie-ups are critical for a food brand that thrives on local flavours and must have a thorough knowledge of the landscape for best-in-class procurement and excellence in production.\u00a0 The brand has 40 SKUs on offer across four categories. These include its flagship DESi PoPz (candy bar on a stick), traditional Indian sweets, snacks and mouth fresheners.\u00a0 GO DESi clocked INR 60 Cr in revenue in FY24 and targets INR 75 Cr in FY25. \u201cGO DESi isn\u2019t just one thing. It\u2019s not just about the products or the stores. It is about crafting a unique experience that our consumers can connect with,\u201d said Vinay.\u00a0 So, it incorporates a whole range of regional flavours and natural ingredients in its products. The focus is more on exploring varieties not readily available in urban markets. For instance, DESi PoPz is mad e from tamarind, mango or guava pulp.\u00a0 It has also introduced yummy but healthy snacks like baked ragi chips, guava bytes, spicy mango bytes and more.\u00a0 But the best part of its product journey is a bold leap to reimagine traditional sweets. Classic Indian treats like  kaju katli ,  laddu  and  barfi  are made cool and contemporary, breathing fresh life into these long-cherished confections. \u201cYou may give your partner a popular chocolate bar on Valentine\u2019s Day, but do you consider giving them a  kaju katli ? Not ever, but why? The challenge lies in making traditional sweets cool enough for that. We are working on a product line that resonates with Gen Z and Generation Alpha,\u201d Vinay sounded confident. How does GO DESi achieve this? By reshaping traditional  barfis  as  barfi  bars resembling chocolate bars. This innovative twist preserves the essence of the treat and aligns with today\u2019s consumer preference. The packaging complements the modern approach and stylish gift boxes are rolled out during Diwali and Raksha Bandhan to add to the \u2018cool\u2019 quotient. If product development is an essential criterion for business success, so is distribution and sales. Brand discovery and reaching customers en masse are challenging for new brands. To cope with it, the founders kept the pricing pocket-friendly. Their flagship product, DESi PoPz, is sold at INR 5 a piece. More importantly, they prioritised offline distribution instead of an online-first approach that most D2C brands choose to minimise intermediary costs. For Vinay, offline distribution comes naturally, given his prior experience, but it was also a strategic move despite the high costs of brick-and-mortar retail.\u00a0 \u201cTo achieve a certain top line, we had to reach a much larger audience, which was initially daunting. Hence, the offline-first approach. Nevertheless, we decided not to rely on a single route and gradually adopted a multi-channel strategy. This worked well, as we did not put all our eggs in one basket. Today, we are truly an omnichannel brand, and this broad distribution approach has driven our success,\u201d explained Vinay. Covid-19 lockdowns in early 2020 further bolstered the decision to diversify the brand\u2019s distribution from offline to online. Its digital journey started with DESi PoPz assortment boxes and the founders saw an opportunity to expand the product line minus the hassles of offline marketing. GO DESi entered the Amazon marketplace and set up its D2C website, followed by quick commerce and offline kiosks. It currently runs 31 kiosks in Bengaluru and claims a presence in 50K offline stores.\u00a0\u00a0 Vinay says he always starts with DESi PoPz (due to its low price point and innovative format) whenever exploring a new distribution channel. The success of the flagship paves the way for the introduction of other products. Currently, about 40% of the D2C player\u2019s sales come from offline, nearly 20% from marketplaces like Flipkart and Amazon, 30% from quick commerce and just 10% from its website, typically through bulk orders.\u00a0 Breaking into an overcrowded retail space and creating a niche is no small feat, especially in a segment ruled by legacy giants like Haldiram\u2019s and Bikanerwala. But the founders did not waver.\u00a0 \u201cThe traditional sweets market in India presents a considerable opportunity, as nearly 85% remains unorganised. Only a handful of players have transitioned to the packaged sweets segment, but the unorganised sector dwarfs the combined confectionery and chocolate markets. It is at least eight to 10 times larger,\u201d observed Vinay. The domestic market for packed sweets  reached INR 6,229.7 Cr in 2023, per a   Research and Markets report , and it is projected to surge to INR 25,970.8 Cr by 2032, at a CAGR of 17.19%.  Although consumers prefer established brands, no single entity can fill this void.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe rising demand for packaged sweets is driving growth across platforms, and this is the gap we aim to address,\u201d said Vinay. Delhi-based Rukam Capital, known for investing in early stage consumer brands, has played a crucial role in this endeavour. GO DESi secured one of its first institutional rounds from Rukam in 2018, and the VC firm has consistently supported the business. It had invested INR 79 Cr across three rounds and recently joined another round of  INR 41 Cr , led by Avishkaar Capital. Vinay also lauded the VC\u2019s support even during challenging times like the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWhat stands out about Rukam is its thorough understanding of the ground reality. It knows what it takes to build and scale a business and understands startups\u2019 unique challenges.\u201d \u201cThe unorganised to organised play is a very important point for an emerging market like India. There are many much loved recipes and food products which appeal to the Indian palette. In the couple of decades prior to our investment in Go DESi with the exception of brands like PULSE, no real startup was created in the impulse category. It is a no-brainer that a high-quality product like Imli PoP would appeal to consumers all over the country,\u201d said Archana Jahagirdar, managing partner at Rukam Capital. She acknowledged that the founders\u2019 backgrounds and their commitment to building a healthy yet tasty product made this investment decision fairly easy.\u00a0 \u201cOur approach with our portfolio is to be there in a non-intrusive way and help with thinking through an appropriate solution for such problems. So, from emphasising on in early days on keeping a close eye on business fundamentals, brand building and adding heft to the leadership team we have been there with the founders every step of the way,\u201d\u00a0 Jahagirdar added. According to industry estimates, around 82% of Indians prefer traditional sweets to Western desserts, chocolate and ice cream. Keeping in mind the evolving market and consumers, GO DESi plans to dive deep into traditional sweets. It will also launch new flavours and explore new product categories. The focus is to ensure widespread consumption of Indian sweets and snacks. The brand aims to double its kiosks from 31 to 60+ across major Indian cities by FY25, achieve a valuation of INR 500 Cr by  2028  and expand the global reach of packaged traditional foods.\u00a0 \u201cWe want to become one of those packaged food brands that make Indian cuisine truly global. Just as Korean cuisine has gained huge popularity and everyone is talking about it, we aspire to achieve the same for Indian sweets,\u201d the founders said. There are glitches, of course, as Indian brands need to adopt healthy ingredients, follow global quality standards and offer a broad range of dietary choices for the diabetic, the vegan, the vegetarian and more. But new-age players like GO DESi and its peers are all set to innovate and cater to the modern palate.",

        "Article Content": "The adoption of smart home technology in India is increasing, driven by factors such as technological advancements, enhanced consumer awareness, and a rise in disposable income and discretionary spending of individuals, just to count a few.\u00a0 As more households embrace the convenience and efficiency of these devices, the Indian smart home market is expected to grow into a  $9.2 Bn  market opportunity by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 9.14%. Leading the charge in this space are players like Haier, Samsung, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals, and Havells Group, among others.\u00a0 Not only this, the sector has also attracted significant investor interest. For instance, earlier this year, smart home automation startup Keus Smart Home raised  INR 100 Cr ($12 Mn)  in a round led by OAKS Asset Management. Similarly, Aliste Technologies, another startup specialising in smart home solutions, secured $1 Mn in December last year.\u00a0 Notably, Reliance Jio launched its  Jio Smart Home Services  in August 2023 to offer users the luxury of having seamless control over their home appliances.\u00a0 However, if we were to delve deeper into this segment, we would observe innovations such as bladeless fans, robotic vacuum cleaners, and smart air purifiers, which have started to gain significant traction. Notably, in this highly attractive market, there are players that have pushed the boundaries of innovation to completely transform the face of the smart home industry. One such example is Jaipur-based  KARBAN Envirotech , which has developed a versatile product that integrates a bladeless fan, air purifier, and chandelier into a single unit. Founded in 2021 by Karan Bansal and Tanya Goyal, KARBAN Envirotech is a consumer electronics brand that specialises in IoT-enabled, energy-efficient climate control solutions for modern homes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find any major players offering integrated solutions, like ours, in this space. There were many air purifier companies and a few manufacturers of bladeless fans. Recessed ceiling fans, often called caged fans, exist but have inadequate airflow and are less appealing. No one was combining a fan, air purifier, and chandelier into a single multi-utility product. Noticing this gap, we patented our product,\u201d Bansal said. Currently, the consumer electronics brand sells its products via its website and on Amazon, which accounts for a majority of its sales. It also has a selective offline dealership process, with around 10 dealers in Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Coimbatore, and Jaipur. The startup currently offers six SKUs, including two prototypes of its 3-in-1 product: the Airzone and a more compact version, the Airzone Lite. According to the cofounders, the company sold over 1,000 products and achieved net sales of INR 1 Cr+ in FY24. So far, the startup has raised INR 9.3 Cr from All in Capital, Titan Capital, Rainmatter, Urban Company, and the JK family office. KARBAN\u2019s story began with cofounder Bansal\u2019s early fascination with mechanical engineering during his school time. Later, while studying mechanical engineering at IIT Guwahati, he developed a keen interest in aerodynamics and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This led him to pursue his Master\u2019s in aerospace engineering from Purdue University. After completing his education, he worked as a CFD research engineer in the US with Convergent Science, where he spent about six years (from 2015 to 2021). During this time, the cofounder worked on various advanced projects, including new compressors, rocket components, and battery cooling technologies. This was the first time Bansal realised the need to do something unique with CFD solutions. Therefore, he quit his job to focus on this technology.  However, along the way, witnessing several gaps in the consumer appliances market, he decided to use his expertise in aerospace, which led him to develop a bladeless fan. In 2021, Bansal began working on the first prototype of a bladeless fan. However, as he designed it, he realised it could be more than just a fan. He thought that instead of focussing on a single product, he should combine multiple functions into one device.\u00a0 With this one device, he also aspired to achieve maximum space efficiency, reduce costs, and eliminate the need for separate devices.\u00a0 This led him to create a product that combined a fan, air purifier, and chandelier into one unit, a feature that was relatively rare in the market. By November 2022, Bansal completed the first prototype, the Airzone. He spent the next 3-4 months refining the design to make it market-ready. The product was officially launched on Amazon in June 2023. In January 2024, they introduced the Airzone Lite, a smaller version of the Airzone. Notably, while Bansal started KARBAN\u2019s journey in 2021 and officially registered the startup in December 2021, he commenced operations only in January 2023. \u201cBefore January 2023, the focus was on laying the groundwork, and the startup was not yet fully operational,\u201d said the cofounder. The startup leverages Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and aerospace engineering to optimise air circulation within a room. For context, CFD is a computer-based method for simulating and analysing fluid flow, including liquids, gases, and plasmas.\u00a0 It uses complex mathematical equations to provide detailed insights into fluid behaviour. CFD is used in fields like aerospace engineering to optimise aerodynamics, weather forecasting to predict conditions, and visual effects to create realistic fluid simulations. By using CFD, the KARBAN team creates detailed computer models of prototypes to simulate performance, airflow, and purification before physical production. This approach allows for rapid adjustments and precise final designs. Moving on, the startup\u2019s Airzone, installed on the ceiling, expands air inflow and boosts efficiency, serving as an alternative to traditional air purifiers and ceiling fans. Its bladeless design prioritises safety by reducing the risk of accidental injuries, while Forever Pure Technology stabilises AQI levels, providing continuous, high-quality air with minimal energy consumption.\u00a0 Everything said and done, Bansal\u2019s journey to KARBAN has not been easy. From building the hardware product to managing limited production and setting up a manufacturing unit, each step posed a significant challenge, the cofounder said. However, the hard work paid off, and in the first month of its operations, the startup generated around INR 3 Lakh in revenue, followed by INR 6 Lakh in the second month, INR 10 Lakh in the third, and INR 20 Lakh in the fourth month of operations.\u00a0 \u201cOur growth has been limited by production capacity. Due to the handcrafted nature of our products, we are unable to make more than 100 units a month. This is also the reason why our products are also priced higher than the ones that are mass-produced,\u201d the founders said. The initial product line was made of wood because using plastic would have required an upfront investment of at least INR 3 to 4 Cr, which the startup didn\u2019t have. \u201cFiguring out how to manufacture with wood was a game-changer,\u201d Bansal said. Another significant challenge was finding the right vendors. With small minimum order quantities (MOQs), the team faced high rates and resistance from vendors hesitant to work with smaller players. \u201cIt took a lot of convincing to get people on board,\u201d Bansal said. Despite these hurdles,  the startup recently secured $1.07 Mn in seed funding , co-led by All in Capital, Titan Capital, and Rainmatter.\u00a0\u00a0 Besides, the cofounder is working on the next version of their product, which is expected to launch within the next four months.  \u201cThe main essence of the product will remain the same. But it will be an upgrade. A major upgrade on the current product. It will be made out of plastic,\u201d said Bansal. The product, as per the founders, will be launched aligned with the startup\u2019s sustainability goals. It will be available in two versions: one made entirely from recycled plastic for environmentally conscious consumers and another using 50% less plastic than existing products.\u00a0 Additionally, in the short term, they plan to partner with distributors and dealers across India for offline expansion. In the medium term, the cofounders aim to scale production by 30 to 40 times. While the startup is currently on the right path, it will have to constantly evolve to introduce a new range of innovative products in the market. This becomes even more imperative as trends related to consumer electronics keep on changing every few years. Plus, the era of smart homes has just started, and to stay ahead in the race, a strong appetite for innovation will be the key to long-term survival. [Edited by Shishir Parasher]",

        "Article Content": "Bengaluru-based AppsForBharat, which runs spiritual tech platform Sri Mandir, has secured $18 Mn (around INR 151.1 Cr) in a Series B funding round led by Nandan Nilekani\u2019s VC fund Fundamentum. The round also saw participation from Susquehanna Asia VC and existing backers like Elevation Capital, Peak XV and Mirae Asset VC. AppsForBharat  plans to use the fresh funds to scale up operations of its Sri Mandir app,  onboard new temples, launch additional services and build a comprehensive tech stack for devotional ecosystem. Prior to this, the spiritual tech startup raised $14 Mn in total funding, with  $10 Mn  and  $4 Mn  in Series A and seed funding rounds, respectively. AppsForBharat launched its flagship app, Sri Mandir in 2021.  The Sri Mandir app lets users create a virtual temple on their phones, enabling them to perform pooja, light diyas, and offer flowers. It offers access to over 50 temples, allowing devotees to participate in pujas, make offerings and access devotional content from home. \u00a0 Prashant Sachan, founder and CEO of AppsForBharat, said, \u201cOur vision is to transform Sri Mandir into an end-to-end digital tech platform that caters to every aspect of the devotional journey.\u201d\u00a0 Sachan told Inc42 that they began monetising the app in August-September 2022, with the first paid services going public in September. \u201cSince then, we have seen significant growth and achieved contribution margin positivity in February 2024.\u201d\u00a0 The company is also looking to turn profitable in the next 18-24 months. Currently, the company generates revenue primarily from its free app, which includes engagement features, charhava and puja. About 25% of demand is from outside India, with primary markets being the US, Canada, the UK, and the emerging market in the Middle East. Sachan added that the app served 4,000 to 5,000 users per month from August 2022 to March 2023. The flagship app has experienced 20X growth in terms of users. The app now has 30 Mn installs. Going forward, for FY25 the founder added that he plans to create a comprehensive tech stack for temples, offering a free SaaS tool to support their operations. He is aiming to grow the user base to tenfold. He projects that if the user base grows tenfold, revenue could also increase tenfold. In the next 12 months, the Sri Mandir app plans to expand by offering services in five new regional languages, increasing its temple listings by tenfold across India, and developing a spiritual tourism ecosystem. The platform aims to enhance the experience for all stakeholders\u2014temples, service providers (pandits/purohits), and devotees\u2014through its tech stack. Additionally, it aims to strengthen its presence in India and scale its international operations. Sachan also said that they are planning to expand into offline channels in the next six months, which is currently in the pilot phase. \u201cWe are leveraging our existing partnerships to enhance offerings and create new experiences for users.\u201d \u201cWhile the platform has been focused on online access, we are now working on integrating offline solutions,\u201d he added. Speaking about the offline experiences, Sachan mentioned, \u201cPeople often go on pilgrimages, but offerings today are non-standardised. We aim to create a trusted platform for booking and accessing these experiences. Just as we manage online pujas through the Sri Mandir app, we will extend these services to offline experiences. Wherever we currently operate online, we will begin offering offline experiences there as well.\u201d AppsForBharat\u2019s loss widened  5X  to INR 44.9 Cr in the financial year ending March 31, 2023, from INR 9 Cr in FY22. The startup\u2019s revenue from operations jumped 92X to INR 3.5 Cr in FY23 from INR 3.8 Lakh in FY22, as per its filings with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Founded in November 2020 by Sachan, an IIT Bombay alumnus and serial entrepreneur, AppsForBharat addresses the gap in devotional and spiritual services for over half a Bn people in India and 50 Mn globally.\u00a0",

It pertained to April 2019 to March 2020 period and amounted to a  total of INR 3.69 Cr . However, the company said that it would be filing an appeal against that order. Zomato has also received a number of GST demand notices in other states in recent times. For instance, it also received a  GST notice of INR 3.5 Lakh in Delhi  and an INR 4.59 Cr from tax authorities in Tamil Nadu in the month of August.\u00a0 Besides the aforementioned GST notices, the company also received tax demand notices from Karnataka, Haryana, and Gujarat GST authorities this year.\u00a0 The developments come at a time when Zomato is rapidly expanding its product stack. A few days ago, it announced the  launch of a developer platform for its point of sale (PoS) partners  to roll out new features for restaurants at scale and in significantly shorter development cycles. Besides, the company also recently unveiled a new platform to help companies solve food expense management. Prior to that, it also launched a  ticket reselling feature  for customers who have bought tickets to a live event on the Zomato app.\u00a0 The launch of new features have come on the back of Zomato\u2019s expanding top and bottom lines. Zomato\u2019s profit grew multifold to  INR 253 Cr in Q1 FY25  from INR 2 Cr in the year-ago quarter. Revenue from operations also jumped 74% to INR 4,206 Cr during the quarter under review from INR 2,416 Cr in Q1 FY24.\u00a0 As a result, the company\u2019s shares have been touching new highs. On Thursday, the stock touched a  lifetime high of INR 285.95  during intraday trading.\u00a0 Overall, Zomato has given 137% returns year to date. The stock ended today\u2019s trading session 3.9% lower at INR 272.90 on the BSE. ",

        "Article Content": "After Competition Commission of India (CCI), the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) also greenlit the merger deal between Reliance-owned Viacom18 and Disney India on Friday (August 30). \u201cFrom the material on record, the scheme appears to be fair and reasonable and is not violative of any provisions of law and is not contrary to public policy\u2026 Since all the requisite statutory compliances have been fulfilled, the said company scheme petition is made absolute in terms of the prayer clauses 28 (a) to (g) thereof\u2026,\u201d read the order of the Mumbai bench of the NCLT.\u00a0 The bench, comprising member (technical) Anu Jagmohan Singh and member (judicial) Kishore Vemulapalli, directed the petitioners \u2013 Viacom 18 Media, Digital18 Media and Star India \u2013 to file a copy of the NCLT order as well as a copy of the merger scheme with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) within 30 days.\u00a0 The development came just two days after the  competition watchdog accorded its approval  to the mega $8.5 Bn merger of Reliance\u2019s media operations and Disney India. With this, the company appears to be well on track to complete the transaction by the end of financial year 2024-25 (FY25). In February this year, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Viacom 18 and The Walt Disney Company signed binding agreements to set up a joint venture (JV) that will combine the media operations of the entities.\u00a0 The deal valued the consolidated entity at a whopping $8.5 Bn on a post-money basis. Once the transaction goes through, RIL will control the joint venture and will own 56% of the JV through its multiple entities. Disney will have a 37% stake in the joint venture, while Bodhi Tree will own the remaining 7%.\u00a0 The transaction will create India\u2019s biggest media empire spanning TV channels as well two of India\u2019s biggest streaming platforms \u2013 JioCinema and Disney+ Hotstar. The combined entity will house more than 120 television channels and will reportedly garner a user base of more than 750 Mn. RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani\u2019s wife and Reliance Foundation chairperson Nita Ambani will helm the joint venture, while Uday Shankar will be the merged entity\u2019s vice-chairperson. In a bid to get the necessary approvals for the merger, RIL and Walt Disney have reportedly been offering a slew of rebates, including proposals to offload some news channels. Earlier this month, the two parties reportedly also proposed a two-year freeze on advertising rate cards to secure the CCI\u2019s approval for their merger.\u00a0 With NCLT\u2019s approval in its kitty, both Reliance and Star India will now approach other regulatory bodies to approve the merger deal.

        "Article Content": "Continuing its export push in India, ecommerce giant Amazon is looking to enable exports worth $5 Bn from Indian sellers in 2024. With this, the  cumulative exports from Indian businesses  via Amazon would surpass $13 Bn by the end of 2024, the ecommerce giant said in a statement. The target is part of the Amazon Global Selling initiative, which was launched in India in 2015. The ecommerce company aims to enable $20 Bn of cumulative exports from India by 2025,  said Amazon\u2019s director of global trade Bhupen Wakankar.\u00a0 Giving an account of the Global Selling Programme 2015, Wakankar said that Amazon enabled about 1.5 Lakh small Indian exporters to sell roughly $8 Bn worth of products directly to overseas consumers by 2023.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re investing significantly in tools and technologies to help sellers optimise their reach, enhance product discovery, and increase sales. The program\u2019s success is reflected in the growing number of exporters building thriving businesses on Amazon\u2019s global marketplaces. We will continue to support the growth of small businesses and startups by leveraging technology and strong linkages with different stakeholders,\u201d Wakankar added.\u00a0 Amazon Global Selling is intended towards making exports easier and accessible for MSMEs and entrepreneurs across India and has exporters from over 200 cities across the country.\u00a0 While states like Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Karnataka lead in terms of number of exporters enrolled under the Amazon Global Selling programme, beauty, apparel, health and personal care, toys and home are among the popular categories.\u00a0 Amazon said it enables sellers to sell their products on over 18 Amazon global marketplaces in countries such as the US, the UK, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Italy, France, Spain, Australia, Singapore, among others. Commenting on the announcement, MoS for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Jayant Chaudhary said, \u201cBoosting MSME exports is crucial for our nation\u2019s economic growth, and ecommerce is proving to be a powerful catalyst in this regard. Ecommerce exports, supported by programs like Amazon Global Selling, are instrumental in providing MSMEs with opportunities to showcase their products to a global audience.\u201d\u00a0 The developments come at a time when companies are trying to diversify their sourcing beyond China amid geopolitical tensions. India has emerged as a significant beneficiary of this shift.  Flipkart\u2019s parent Walmart is also increasing exports from India  in a bid to reduce its reliance on China. Meanwhile, Amazon continues to bet big on India. With increasing internet connectivity, improving access to smartphones, and a fast-growing economy, the country has emerged as a big market for India. Last year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy  committed to invest $26 B n in India by 2030.\u00a0 Earlier today, it was reported that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is in discussion to invest an additional $2 Bn in Telangana to expand its data centre capabilities in the state. However, Amazon also continues to face criticism as regulatory troubles from time to time in India. Last month, union minister Piyush Goyal flagged  Amazon\u2019s \u201cpredatory pricing policies\u201d  and said that the ecommerce major plans to invest billions of dollars in India only to offset its losses.",

        "Article Content": "Big tech major Apple unveiled the latest iPhone 16 range of smartphones at its flagship \u201cGlowtime\u201d event in Cupertino on Monday (September 9). The event saw the launch of two different models \u2013 iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. The new iPhone 16 will be available in India starting at INR 79,900, while iPhone 16 Plus (512 GB) will cost INR 1.2 Lakh.\u00a0 The latest smartphones will hit the shelves in India starting September 20.\u00a0 Additionally, the company also launched its latest range of Apple Watch and AirPods. While the newly unveiled Apple Watch Series 10 has been priced starting at INR 46,900, AirPods 4 and AirPods 2 Pro will be priced at INR 12,900 and INR 24,900, respectively.\u00a0 \u201cWith new ways to discover the world around you and capture memories using Camera Control; a 48MP Fusion camera that gives you two optical-quality cameras in one; a big boost in battery life; and powerful, efficient performance thanks to the A18 chip, this is the perfect time for customers to upgrade or make the switch to iPhone,\u201d said Apple\u2019s vice president of iPhone product marketing Kaiann Drance. Powered by its in-house A18 series chipsets, the new  iPhone 16 features a 6.1-inch screen  and will include a 48 MP \u201cFusion Camera\u201d. Available in five different colours, the new iPhones will also come built in with multiple artificial intelligence (AI) features. It is pertinent to note that the big tech major unveiled its GenAI offering called \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d at its developer conference in June this year, which can generate text, images and other content on command. What is however interesting is that many of these new iPhone 16 smartphones will be manufactured in India. As per a report by Economic Times, \u201cMade-in-India\u201d iPhone 16 will be available across the world within the first few days of the launch of sales. Typically, Apple commences worldwide sales within 10-12 days of the launch at the flagship event. This is a much faster timeline than 2022, when it took nearly two weeks for made-in-India iPhone 14 to hit the global shelves. In 2021, the lag was a few months for iPhone 13 models, meaning these smartphones hit global outlets months after initial launch.\u00a0 However, iPhone 15 smartphones were shipped to overseas markets within days of the launch last year.\u00a0 Sources told Economic Times that original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Foxconn has already kicked off production of the new series of smartphones in India, which will be exported to multiple countries \u201cwithin the first few days of the start of sales\u201d. The new launches come at a time when Apple has actively diversified its production outside of China amid geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington DC. This pivot to India also comes on the back of hefty production linked incentives (PLIs) and other sops offered by the Centre.\u00a0 As per Economic Survey 2023-24, India contributed about 14% to Apple\u2019s overall production in FY24 and emerged as a key hub for its global exports. Contract manufacturers Foxconn, Wistron (now owned by Tata Group) and Pegatron  cumulatively produced iPhones worth INR 1.2 Lakh Cr  in India in FY24, of which INR 85,000 Cr worth of devices were exported. A report by JPMorgan projected that  Apple plans to shift 25% of its iPhone production to India  by 2025 with an eye on cutting down its over dependence on China and diversifying its manufacturing bases.",

        "Article Content": "In a big boost to India\u2019s fast-growing semiconductor industry, tech giant Apple is reportedly mulling using made-in-India chips for the iPhones produced in the country. Apple is in talks with Micron, the Tata Group, and other chip manufacturers setting up plants in India to source supplies worth $12 Bn for the India-produced iPhones, Financial Express reported citing sources. If Micron and Tata Group\u2019s units manufacture the grades needed by Apple, the bulk of the chip needed for iPhones would be sourced from these firms, creating a huge business opportunity, a source was quoted as saying by the publication. The source also noted that no single company would be able to rival Apple\u2019s spend on microchips made in India despite demand from buyers for these chips from the defence, aviation and auto sectors. Following the launch of the production-linked incentive scheme to boost semiconductor production in the country, US-based chip manufacturer Micron received approval from the cabinet ministry in June 2023 to set up a semiconductor unit in Gujarat. This year, Tata Electronics also received the Centre\u2019s approval to set up a semiconductor fab in Dholera, Gujarat in partnership with Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (PSMC), Taiwan. Tata is also setting up a second semiconductor unit in Morigaon, Assam. Meanwhile, Apple is one of the top buyers of semiconductor chips in the world. Leading chip manufacturer Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\u2019s (TSMC) got 26% of its total revenue from Apple alone in 2021. As per reports, Apple was also responsible for 23% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in 2022. Meanwhile, Apple is gradually increasing the production of iPhones in India. As per the Economic Survey 2023-24, India contributed about 14% to Apple\u2019s overall production in FY24. Contract manufacturers Foxconn, Wistron (now owned by Tata Group) and Pegatron cumulatively produced iPhones worth INR 1.2 Lakh Cr in the country in FY24. Of this, INR 85,000 Cr worth of devices were exported. Apple will also manufacture the latest iPhone 16 series in India and the  made-in-India phones would be available across the world  within the first few days of the launch of the smartphones. Earlier this year, Apple was also said to be  in discussions with Murugappa Group and Tata Group\u2019s Titan  to assemble and possibly manufacture sub-components for iPhone camera modules. As per Inc42\u2019s analysis, India\u2019s semiconductor market is expected to clock a 24% CAGR and reach a size of $150 Bn by 2030 from $33 Bn in 2023.\u00a0",

In an exchange filing, Nazara said that its board approved the strategic investment by a way of secondary acquisition of 18.96 Lakh equity shares at a face value of INR 10 each of Moonshine Technology from its existing shareholders \u2014 including founder Navkiran Singh, cofounders Puneet Singh, Avneet Rana, Varun Ganjoo, Anirudh Chaudhry, Gurjeet Kaur, private equity firm Bellerive Capital and skill- and chance-based gaming company Influencers Interactive. Of the total INR 831.5 Cr investment, Nazara will pay INR 592.26 Cr in cash while the remaining INR 239.25 Cr will be paid through a share swap through issuance of fully paid-up equity shares of the company. Further, the board of Nazara has approved an additional equity infusion of up to INR 150 Cr into Moonshine through issuance of compulsorily convertible preference shares, bringing the total investment to INR 982 Cr \u2014 the biggest bet on any company by Nazara till date. However, the transaction is subject to approval of Nazara\u2019s shareholders and other regulatory approvals if required. This acquisition will strengthen Nazara\u2019s presence in the online gaming sector and bring Moonshine under its fold as an associate company. Moonshine Technology has seven subsidiaries \u2014 Ross Technologies Private Limited, Baazi Networks Private Limited, Baazi Games Private Limited, and SBN Gaming Network Private Limited. Moonshine also operates the online poker platform PokerBaazi through its 100% subsidiary Baazi Networks. Additionally, it runs a sports and casual gaming vertical under the brand name SportsBaazi, a step-down subsidiary, which offers online sports, casual, and fantasy games. In FY24, PokerBaazi contributed approximately 87% of the Target Group\u2019s net revenue, while SportsBaazi accounted for around 12%. Nazara has been making multiple acquisitions in recent times. Few days back the gaming major acquired a 15.86% stake in gaming community platform GetStan Technologies Pte. Ltd (STAN) for INR 18.4 Cr (around $2.2 Mn).\u00a0 Last month, it received the letter of intent (LoI) to acquire insolvency-ridden sports entertainment startup Smaaash Entertainment.

In July, Muralikrishnan B said that  Xiaomi India plans to ship 70 Cr devices , including smartphones, televisions, tablets, and connected devices, out of India over the next decade. The development also comes at a time when Xiaomi\u2019s position in the smartphone market in India,one of its biggest markets outside China, has been challenged by other players. The Chinese smartphone maker lost the top spot, by number of shipments, among smartphone brands in India for as many as 18 months.\u00a0 It finally made a comeback in Q2 2024 when it reclaimed the first spot, with an 18% market share and 6.7 Mn units shipped during the quarter, as per Canalys.\u00a0 Additionally, the company\u2019s profit continues to be in free fall. As per a report, Xiaomi India\u2019s net profit declined 77% to INR 238.63 Cr in the fiscal year 2022-23 (FY23) as against a profit of INR 1,057.7 Cr in FY22.\u00a0 Meanwhile, revenue from operations tanked 32% to INR 26,697 Cr in FY23 from the INR 39,100 Cr in the year-ago period.\u00a0",

In absolute terms, Practo\u2019s revenue surged to INR 242 Cr in FY24 from INR 195 Cr in the previous year. Offering a deeper insight into its operations, the healthtech startup said that it saw a \u201csignificant growth\u201d in Tier-2, 3 markets, with revenue zooming 50%. It also claimed to have clocked a 20% revenue jump in Tier-1 markets.\u00a0 Sharing data about its hospital management system, Insta, Practo said that the SaaS platform reported a 98% retention rate and is cash flow positive. It also said that Insta is used by more than 1,500 healthcare centres globally and accounted for a 15% market share in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\u00a0 Going forward, the healthtech startup plans to \u201cbuild\u201d a \u201crepeatable\u201d engine for sales and customer growth. It also plans to further improve its products and brand investments to achieve year-on-year (YoY) double-digit growth in revenue and profit. In its annual letter for FY24, Practo said that it plans to explore expansion into new geographic regions to grow its reach and add more users to its kitty. Practo also plans to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to bolster its offerings going forward.\u00a0 \u201cThe company\u2019s top priority in FY25 is to grow profitably and build innovative products that continue to improve health outcomes. With advancements in AI, Practo expects to upgrade its products to include the best AI features for both consumers and providers,\u201d added the statement.\u00a0 Practo cofounder and CEO Shashank ND said, \u201c\u2026 Data science offers the promise of preventing human error in diagnosis, matching patients with the right healthcare providers, reducing unnecessary costs through accurate diagnoses, and minimising wasted resources due to misdiagnosis. And Practo stands at the forefront of this data-driven healthcare revolution.\u201d Founded in 2008 by Abhinav Lal and Shashank, Practo is a healthtech platform that offers telemedicine and doctor appointment booking services. It also offers a SaaS platform that helps hospitals manage their systems.\u00a0 The startup has raised over $228 Mn in funding since its inception and is backed by the likes of Peak XV Partners, Matrix Partners India, Tencent, RTP Global, and Sofina.\u00a0 The turnaround comes a year after  Practo fired more than 41 employees  as part of its performance management and planning process in April last year.\u00a0 Since then, the startup appears to have brought its expenses under control and streamlined its operations. Meanwhile, India\u2019s healthtech market continues to make rapid strides and is  projected to be a $21 Bn space by 2025 .",

It has seven diagnostic centres and 60 collection centres across Odisha. Commenting on the development, MedGenome CEO  Dr. Vedam Ramprasad said, \u201cThis acquisition further aims to expand our network in Tier-II & III cities in India by driving deeper penetration, new market development, and bringing new tests to the market.\u201d This is the second acquisition by MedGenome in the last year or so.

        "Article Content": "Amid plans of  reverse flipping to India ahead of its potential IPO , edtech unicorn  Eruditus  is reportedly in advanced talks to raise $150 Mn in a fresh funding round led by Texas-based private equity firm TPG at a likely valuation of $2.3 Bn. The potential new valuation would be 28% lower than its previous valuation of $3.2 Bn in August 2021, when the company that offers upskilling courses to professionals  joined the unicorn club after raising $650 Mn  from a clutch of investors, including Accel and SoftBank Vision Fund II. However, this valuation hinges on Eruditus meeting certain performance targets, failing which the Indian edtech juggernaut will see its market capitalization shrink to $1.8 Bn, TechCrunch reported, citing sources. If and when the funding comes through, it would also mark the first equity infusion in Eruditus since August 2021.\u00a0 Founded by Chaitanya Kalipatnapu and Ashwin Damera in 2010, Eruditus offers online courses from prestigious global business schools such as Columbia, MIT, London Business School, Harvard Business School on subjects like artificial intelligence, data science and data coding. Besides, the Mumbai-based startup also offers courses from top Indian institutions such as IIT Kozhikode and IIM Lucknow, among others. Eruditus competes with the likes of BYJU\u2019S, upGrad and NYSE-listed Coursera.\u00a0 The startup, which counts marquee investors such as SoftBank, Accel and Peak XV and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board among its backers, had raised more than $1.16 Bn in funding as of March 2022, according to Inc42 data. The potential $150 Mn investment in Eruditus comes at a time when the startup is reportedly planning to shift its domicile to India from Singapore. Reports suggest that Eruditus is mulling a reverse flip as it seeks to list on Indian bourses likely within the next two years. And Eruditus is not the only Indian startup seeking a desh wapsi. While fintech giants such as PhonePe and Groww have already reverse flipped to India, the likes of Zepto, Razorpay, and Flipkart are also mulling such a move. Most recently, Pine Labs  got the nod from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)  to shift its base back to India. Eruditus narrowed its net loss to INR 1,049 Cr in the financial year 2022-23 (FY23) from INR 2,680 Cr in the preceding fiscal year. However, it reported a  strong growth in its gross revenue  in the reported quarter, which stood at INR 3,320 Cr in FY23, up 75% from INR 1,900 Cr in FY22. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Investors of embattled edtech giant  BYJU\u2019S  have moved the Supreme Court (SC), which is hearing a plea filed by a consortium of the company\u2019s US-based lenders regarding insolvency proceedings, to intervene in the case so that they can put forward their concerns.\u00a0 General Atlantic, Peak XV Partners, Sofina SA, and MIH Edtech Investments are among the investors of BYJU\u2019S which have knocked on the doors of the SC, CNBC-TV18 reported. According to the report, the aforementioned investors of BYJU\u2019S are seeking the court\u2019s permission to address issues of mismanagement, alleged fund syphoning, financial irregularities, and ongoing investigations by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The report added that Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), has sought an early hearing of the matter. The call for an early hearing has found support from BYJU\u2019S CEO and founder Byju Raveendran as well as GLAS Trust, the consortium of the US-based lenders. It is pertinent to note that BYJU\u2019S investors are already  engaged in a legal battle with the startup at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)  since February 2024.\u00a0 Back then, the investors were opposing the startup\u2019s $200 Mn rights issue to be undertaken at a valuation cut of 99%.\u00a0 After BYJU\u2019S extraordinary general meeting (EGM) and rights issue went ahead amid legal back and forth, the investors filed a plea before the NCLT alleging oppression and mismanagement within the company. While the contentious rights issue appeals are being heard at the Bengaluru bench of the Tribunal, the  sword of bankruptcy  is currently dangling on the head of the startup.\u00a0 Earlier this month, the SC revived the insolvency proceedings against BYJU\u2019S while hearing a plea filed by GLAS Trust against the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal\u2019s (NCLAT) order to quash the insolvency proceedings.\u00a0 The NCLAT had set aside the insolvency proceedings after the BCCI and BYJU\u2019s reached an agreement, under which the latter would pay its dues of INR 158 Cr to the cricket board. While the  future looks bleak  for BYJU\u2019S, founder Raveendran continues to be optimistic. In a recent email to employees, he said that the company is on the brink of reversing the negative business cycle that began two years ago and ready to launch BYJU\u2019S 3.0 \u2013 \u201can AI-driven, hyper-personalised educational platform low on cost and high on impact\u201d.

        "Author URL": "https://inc42.com/author/brandlabs/",
        "Article Content": "The healthcare sector in India has taken significant strides in the past two decades. The country boasts 1.34 doctors per 1,000 people, past the WHO recommendation. The homegrown healthcare market has reached around $372 Bn and is growing at a CAGR of 22%, while the global market is worth $10 Tn. Despite the huge growth, surgery is less expensive at home, around  one-tenth  of what it costs in the US or Western Europe. These numbers are important, but some ground realities in the Indian healthcare sector are equally so.  Consider this: A 2019 EY survey revealed that   61% of patients  felt hospitals did not prioritise their best interests. Those surveyed cited poor hospital responsiveness, long wait times and a disregard for patient feedback. In essence, local healthcare services are still fraught with challenges. But new-age Indian startups are increasingly making forays into this space to address the obvious and the not-so-obvious healthcare issues.  \u00a0\u00a0 Pristyn Care , a  healthtech unicorn  launched in 2018, aims to address issues related to patient care. Founded by the husband-wife duo Dr Vaibhav Kapoor and Dr Garima Sawhney, along with their friend Harsimarbir Singh, the company enables elective surgery (non-emergency procedures) through its network of 300+ partner hospitals. \u201cVaibhav and I had set up practices at the time and experienced patient problems firsthand. Harsh [Harsimarbir], too, had a close encounter as his mother had to undergo surgery,\u201d said Dr Sawhney, explaining what motivated the founders to address this gap. Inc42 spoke to Dr Sawhney to understand how Pristyn Care enhances patient experience, the role of AI in improving patient engagement and how her journey as a doctor has shaped the startup\u2019s core philosophy. Here are the edited excerpts from the interview. Inc42: What motivated you to launch Pristyn Care? Were you moved by patient pain points?\u00a0 Dr Garima Sawhney:  As a doctor, I have had a 360-degree view of the healthcare system. I practised at several hospitals and experienced their strengths and weaknesses firsthand. These experiences became a wellspring of knowledge for me. During that period, the patient\u2019s perspective became quite evident. For instance, long waits for doctors\u2019 appointments and surgeries across government hospitals were a constant cause of frustration. Similarly, transparency could be a big challenge. When I started my practice, it allowed me to connect with patients directly. I noticed that they craved more time with their doctors. They needed easy access and clear communication. A diagnosis and treatment plan were often handed over without delving deep into what would happen during and after treatment. It was not an ideal situation. So, Vaibhav, Harsh and I brainstormed solutions to improve the healthcare experience. We recognised a significant gap in the system, wanted to build trust among patients and ensure a smooth surgical experience. That\u2019s how Pristyn Care was born.\u00a0 Inc42:  As a medical professional, you have a thorough understanding of patient requirements. Did that help you usher in the successful patient-centricity at Pristyn Care? \u00a0\u00a0 Dr Garima Sawhney:  I have always tried to see things from a patient\u2019s perspective. Surgery is rarely a pleasant experience, and it can be incredibly stressful for patients and their families. At Pristyn Care, we recognise their emotional state. Our patient care coordinator team is the first point of contact, and they undergo extensive training for 30 to 40 days to communicate effectively with patients. While speaking to them, the coordinators gather detailed information about their medical conditions, symptoms and needs. This creates a sense of trust and comfort, as patients know they can soon visit a doctor at a clinic close to their place. The entire procedure is well-planned and detail-oriented. During the one-to-one consultation, the doctor examines the patient, listens carefully and explains the diagnosis and treatment options. If surgery is required, Pristyn Care manages the insurance process and our patients don\u2019t have to navigate complex insurance websites or visit different hospitals for insurance approvals. Our coordinators handle all formalities on behalf of our patients and connect them with the most suitable partner hospitals. Inc42: What\u2019s done next? Dr Garima Sawhney:  Unlike traditional hospital booking, we arrange a week\u2019s stay in advance, doing away with the additional stress of finding a room on arrival. More importantly, we have established partnerships with these hospitals for the highest quality care throughout the surgery. Post-surgery, our team monitors everything related to patient care so that families do not face delays and uncertainties. We clearly communicate discharge processes and update status at all times. Since its launch, Pristyn Care\u2019s net promoter score (NPS) has never dipped below 68% and it is currently around 72%. However, we constantly strive to improve the patient experience. Inc42: Hospital experience is bound to impact a patient\u2019s well-being. What do you do to ensure the best possible outcomes? Dr Garima Sawhney:  I often cite this example to explain what happens when we perform surgery: We have to transfer patients from a waiting room to an operating theatre (OT). But OTs are not the kind of theatres where movies are featured. Surgery is a necessary procedure, but no one enjoys it.\u00a0 In healthcare, we operate within a specialised surgical ecosystem, and ensuring the highest patient safety level is paramount. The hospitals where our patients are treated must adhere to the highest safety standards, as we prioritise patient safety during every surgical procedure. We have set up a dedicated 20-member team to assess the quality of hospitals where our patients are treated. Their role is crucial as they make sure that each hospital is fully equipped, has all necessary licences and fully complies with all regulations. Plus, all essential equipment must be in place to perform surgeries safely. The comfort between the doctor and the patient is also crucial for a successful outcome. Only hospitals that meet our stringent criteria are approved to partner with Pristyn Care. Inc42: How does Pristyn Care build patient trust?\u00a0 Dr Garima Sawhney:  Absolutely! When we built this company on the understanding that undergoing surgery is a critical decision. Patients don\u2019t simply book appointments, meet doctors and schedule procedures. They need reassurance and we are building that confidence among patients.\u00a0 Understanding a patient\u2019s requirements is crucial for any healthcare provider. By knowing their fears and expectations, you can take steps to gain their trust and guide them through the entire process. In essence, this is the core foundation based on which patients come in for treatment. I think healthcare staff should be especially attuned to patient needs. It takes time and hands-on experience to understand the complexities of healthcare terminology and patients\u2019 concerns. We have developed a comprehensive training programme called Mira AI for our care co-ordinators that combines AI modules with self-learning activities. The AI modules delve into specific diseases, explaining symptoms, common patient concerns, appropriate communication strategies and available treatment options. This holistic training equips co-ordinators to engage confidently with patients and address their needs effectively. Our focus is not on technical skills or communication basics for doctors. We emphasise the human touch, their empathy, to be precise. While doctors naturally possess this quality, we offer support through our SOPs (standard operating procedures) to ensure they connect with patients effectively. The focus on empathy often leads to a better patient experience.\u00a0 Inc42: As a woman leading a healthtech unicorn, what are your key takeaways and advice for aspiring women leaders in this field? Dr Garima Sawhney:  Well, I will be honest. It is not a walk in the park. But here is what I have learnt. You need to understand your unique value proposition. Why are you here? What problem are you solving that needs addressing? That is your focus. Now, whatever you are doing, understand it inside out. Develop a risk management strategy for everything you do. That is the cornerstone of building a strong organisation. As a woman, you will likely know how to manage your personal and professional life (and often excel at it). But when you are at work, achieving balance is the key. So, delegate at home, raise your family, but manage everything simultaneously. Also, surround yourself with those who can help you learn; they can be your mentors, peers or colleagues. Build a network of people who can support your growth on this journey. And finally, do remember that good things happen along the way. Be transparent with your family and share your dreams. Also, build a work family, a team that feels like an extension of your own, and enjoy the small wins together.",

As per a PTI report, a bench led by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, along with Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, was urged by senior advocate NK Kaul to expedite the hearing of  BYJU\u2019S  case.\u00a0 Kaul said, \u201cThe only funding has been provided by the promoters, and there has been no external borrowing.

In late August, hospitality major Marriott Group began working to set up its first global capability centre (GCC) in the country in Hyderabad, Babu was quoted as saying in the report. Babu also revealed that strategy is to go beyond attracting core technology companies and to persuade large multinationals from diverse sectors to make Telangana their tech hub. This move comes at a time when competition for investments from multinational brands across sectors is on peak from states such as Karnataka and Tamil Nadu among others. As of June, Karnataka\u2019s information technology and biotechnology (IT/BT) and rural development and panchayati raj (RDPR) minister Priyank Kharge said he expects the state to attract  investment  of $6.2 Bn in technology sectors such as biotechnology, AI, semiconductors, AVGC (animation, visual effects, gaming, and comics), and healthtech from the US and Europe.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on his recent visit to the United States has met with various MNC headquarters such as Microsoft, Apple and Google to shake hands with the business leaders for their business expansion in the state and new investments. Few days ago, tech giant Google  inked  a pact with the Tamil Nadu government to explore manufacturing of its \u2018Made in India\u2019 Pixel 8 smartphones, skill development and build an industrial ecosystem, enabling MSMEs to create scalable AI solutions. So far, the cloud arm of ecommerce giant Amazon AWS has opened two data centre infrastructures, with one in Mumbai region and the other in Hyderabad region. The second infrastructure Cloud region in Hyderabad was established by mid-2022 with three availability zones. The AWS  investment  came at a cost of INR 20,761 Cr ($2.77 Bn).",

Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin announced this development on Tuesday (September 10) on X, highlighting it as one of three major announcements secured by the state government. \u201cA significant investment of INR 2,000 Cr at Tiruchirapalli by Jabil, a global leader in EMS. This will create 5,000 jobs and create a new cluster for electronics manufacturing,\u201d  he said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between Jabil officials and the Tamil Nadu state delegation. With Jabil\u2019s entry into the state, Tamil Nadu now hosts several major Apple suppliers, including Foxconn, Pegatron, Tata Electronics, and Corning. Jabil, a supplier to Cisco and HP, will establish a major new facility in Trichy, marking one of the first significant investments in the area. This move is expected to create a new electronics cluster similar to the ones in Sriperumbudur and Hosur with Tata Electronics. The minister said that, besides Jabil, two other investments were secured for the state\u2013 Rockwell Automation will expand its manufacturing in Kanchipuram with a INR 666 Cr investment, creating 365 jobs, and an MoU with Autodesk aims to skill youth and boost MSMEs and startups, strengthening the overall industrial ecosystem.

        "Article Content": "Already facing allegations of \u2018secretly plotting\u2019 against the US-based lenders of BYJU\u2019S, the edtech firm\u2019s interim resolution professional Pankaj Srivastava has yet again come under scanner \u2014 this time due to allegations from Aditya Birla Finance. The financial services arm of the Aditya Birla Group has moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against Srivastava, alleging that he committed fraud by wrongfully labelling the lender as an \u2018operational creditor\u2019 instead of a \u2018financial creditor\u2019, Mint reported. For context, financial creditors are those entities or individuals from whom the debtor has obtained loan or debt security. On the other hand, operational creditors supply goods or services to a company for their business operations. Appearing for Aditya Birla Finance, senior counsel Udaya Holla reportedly informed the tribunal that even as  BYJU\u2019S  owes the company INR 139 Cr, Srivastava issued a notice in the meeting of committee of creditors fraudulently classifying them as operational creditors. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) documents accessed by Inc42 showed that Aditya Birla Finance filed claims worth INR 47.2 Cr, of which 30 Cr has been admitted by the resolution professional. It is pertinent to mention that financial creditors have the first claim on the assets of a bankrupt company, followed by operational creditors. The bench of Justices K Biswal and Manoj Kumar Dubey has listed the next hearing on Aditya Birla Finance\u2019s plea against Srivastava on September 24. The resolution professional has been directed to file his objections in a week. Earlier, Glas Trust \u2014 a consortium of US-based lenders that extended a $1.2 Bn term loan B to BYJU\u2019S \u2014 also filed a petition before the NCLT against Srivastava, seeking the removal of the interim resolution professional. Glas Trust claims BYJU\u2019s has still not paid dues worth INR 11,432 Cr ($1.36 Bn). While the US-based lender had also sought a stay on further meetings of the CoC amid the ongoing insolvency proceedings against BYJU\u2019S, the tribunal  refused to grant it interim relief , citing the August 21 Supreme Court order that allowed its constitution.\u00a0 The NCLT asked Glas Trust to file a fresh plea challenging its exclusion from the creditor\u2019s committee if it wished to pursue the matter. Notably, Srivastava earlier  ousted Glas Trust from the creditors\u2019 committee  of BYJU\u2019S, claiming it did not represent the minimum 51% of the lenders in the consortium. Meanwhile, tax authorities have also filed claims for INR 848 Cr with BYJU\u2019S resolution professional. \u00a0",

        "Article Content": "The Supreme Court today (September 11) said that it will hear on September 17 the appeal of US-based creditor Glas Trust Company LLC against a ruling by National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) that had stayed the insolvency proceedings against embattled edtech giant BYJU\u2019S. A bench led by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, along with Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra, agreed to expedite the hearing following requests from multiple lawyers citing new developments in the case, news agency PTI reported. The plea regarding insolvency proceedings against BYJU\u2019s was brought up by senior advocate N.K. Kaul, representing the ed-tech company, emphasising the need for an urgent hearing. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the BCCI, and senior lawyer Abhishek Singhvi, also supporting BYJU\u2019s, backed this request. Kaul noted that another related plea is also scheduled for hearing on September 17. The Supreme Court last month overturned the NCLAT\u2019s ruling that quashed the bankruptcy proceedings against  BYJU\u2019S  and approved an INR 158.9 Cr settlement between the debt-ridden edtech firm and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). This follows the recent postponement by the Bengaluru bench of the NCLT regarding Glas Trust\u2019s petition, which sought to halt further meetings of BYJU\u2019s committee of creditors (CoC). Glas Trust, part of a consortium of US lenders that had extended a $1.2 billion term loan to BYJU\u2019s parent company in 2021, was reportedly removed from the creditors\u2019 committee shortly after its first meeting on September 3. BYJU\u2019S, once the poster child of the Indian startup ecosystem, is now grappling with multiple challenges, including mass layoffs, a severe cash crunch, delays in filing financial statements, numerous legal battles, and increasing regulatory scrutiny. Compounding these issues is a public spat with investors amid escalating losses. The company\u2019s net loss surged 81% year-on-year to INR 8,245.2 crore in FY22.",

        "Author URL": "https://inc42.com/author/kruthikaa-lakshman/",
        "Article Content": "Earlier this year, we reported how the  Indian healthcare sector was poised for a complete makeover  with the advent of GenAI. From lab assistance and clinical diagnosis to health monitoring and drug discovery, hardly anything falls outside the ambit of this emerging technology today. In fact, the technology has now seamlessly seeped into the realm of medicine and antibody discovery to combat some of the most gruesome diseases known to mankind.\u00a0 However, given that the tech is in its nascent stages, we have yet to make major headways towards making the use of this tech cost-effective and more agile. Any move in this direction will prove to be pivotal, as it typically takes more than a decade and billions of dollars in investments to discover a new drug and then bring it to market.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is this paradigm that Bengaluru-based startup  immunitoAI  aspires to disrupt. Founded by Aridni Shah and Trisha Chatterjee in 2020, the biotech startup is using artificial intelligence (AI) to expedite antibody discovery and reduce its cost. Operating in a market expected to reach $13.21 Bn by 2028 on the back of increased investment in drug discovery and demand for precision therapeutics, the startup uses AI to design novel antibodies from scratch. In the process, the founders remain laser-focused on reducing drug discovery time from an average of 4-5 years to 11-12 months. In September 2020, immunitoAI secured $1 Mn in seed funding led by pi Ventures. The startup\u2019s story began in 2020 with Entrepreneur First\u2019s (EF) talent program, which brought Shah and Chatterjee together, as they shared a common goal of changing how drugs are discovered. This eventually paved the way for the incorporation of immunitoAI. \u201cEF\u2019s program provided the platform for us to meet and combine our expertise,\u201d Chatterjee said. However, the path ahead presents significant challenges, and the biggest one amongst the spectrum was scepticism of the industry and investors towards AI applications in the field of biology.\u00a0 The biotech industry\u2019s history of unfulfilled promises, and there are several of them, has bred scepticism towards AI in healthcare. Shah noted, \u201cIn biology, AI has unfortunately been misused. Many have made humongous claims and have not delivered. Hence, people are sceptical to accept AI-based solutions in biology.\u201d immunitoAI faces the challenge of proving its AI-driven approach can truly accelerate antibody discovery while maintaining scientific rigour. The founders\u2019 combined expertise in biology and computer science has been crucial in addressing these concerns.\u00a0 Nevertheless, as per Chatterjee, immunitoAI treads differently as compared to traditional antibody discovery companies that follow the standard operating procedures of injecting target proteins into animals to produce antibodies. Chatterjee added that this popular practice can take years and doesn\u2019t guarantee effective drug candidates. Speaking about the startup\u2019s AI tech stack, the cofounder said that the immunitoAI platform comprises two main arms: imDESIGN and imRANK.\u00a0 She elaborated that while imDESIGN utilises generative AI models to create new antibody designs from scratch, imRANK then evaluates these designs, predicting how well they might bind to their targets and ranking them based on various parameters. The platform employs deep learning algorithms trained on experimental data from protein databases. In addition, it uses graph neural networks to represent the 3D structure of proteins and transformer models to generate antibody sequences. \u201cOur AI models work at the atomic level, analysing the interactions between individual atoms in the antibody and target protein. This allows for a more precise prediction of binding affinity and potential drug properties,\u201d Chatterjee further explained.\u00a0 Although in the testing phase, immunitoAI has achieved 90-95% accuracy in generating biologically viable antibody sequences.\u00a0 \u201cCurrently, we\u2019re focused on improving the binding affinity of antibodies to their targets. Our next step is to benchmark our antibody designs against existing ones. We\u2019ll select a target with a known antibody in the market and generate our own version. This will allow us to compare the development timelines and efficacy,\u201d the cofounder said. Apart from this, the startup plans to conduct laboratory experiments to validate its AI-generated antibodies. This includes synthesising the antibodies and testing their binding properties and stability in real-world conditions. Currently, immunitoAI has plans to collaborate with pharmaceutical companies to design antibodies aimed at specific diseases. Once the startup develops promising antibody candidates, it plans to licence them to pharmaceutical companies for further development and clinical trials. \u201cWe\u2019re in discussions with several top pharmaceutical companies. They\u2019re interested in our ability to potentially reduce the time and cost of the initial drug discovery phase,\u201d Chatterjee said. The startup is also in the process of protecting its intellectual property. Looking ahead, immunitoAI is preparing for future funding rounds.\u00a0 \u00a0 Meanwhile, companies like immunitoAI seem to be growing in the world\u2019s third-largest startup ecosystem. In March this year, we extensively talked about a similar startup, Boltzmann, which, too, harnesses GenAI to facilitate drug discovery and enhance the success rates of clinical trials. Boltzmann uses both open-source and proprietary models to design novel drugs and optimise R&D processes for Indian drug manufacturers. Alongside this, Boltzmann\u2019s technology stack includes four platforms that aid in clinical trials, disease diagnosis, and the design and discovery of vaccines and antibodies. As per a report, the Indian market for AI in drug discovery is projected to surpass INR 2.57 Lakh Cr by 2028. For now, it will be interesting to see how immunitoAI changes the drug discovery game in the country going ahead.",

It is pertinent to note that a clutch of US-based creditors lent the company $1.2 Bn TLB in November 2021 to fund its overseas operations. Meanwhile, the edtech major\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary and coaching chain Aakash Educational Services Ltd (AESL) has filed a claim of INR 1,404 Cr ($167 Mn).\u00a0 As per Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) documents accessed by Inc42, AESL and Glas Trust have been listed as \u201cunsecured financial creditors\u201d of the troubled edtech\u2019s parent, Think & Learn Pvt Ltd.\u00a0 At present, the troubled edtech major is being run by the court-appointed resolution professional, Pankaj Srivastava, who has invited lenders, employees, vendors and the government to claim their respective outstandings.\u00a0 So far, claims worth over INR 13,027 Cr have been received from 1,887 creditors, most of which are still under review. As per IBBI documents, fintech major InCred Financial Services has claimed dues to the tune of INR 20.34 Cr. Notably, the IRP has admitted the entire claim filed by InCred against BYJU\u2019S. Another entity, Anglo Asia, has filed a claim to claw back a \u201cloan\u201d worth INR 810 Cr to BYJU\u2019S.\u00a0 As many as 95 entities listed as \u201coperational creditor\u201d of the edtech startup have filed claims worth INR 425.12 Cr against BYJU\u2019S. Of these, the IRP has admitted the claims of just one company, Aditya Birla Finance. The financial services arm of the conglomerate filed claims worth nearly INR 47.12 Cr against the edtech startup, of which nearly INR 30 Cr was admitted by IRP Srivastava.\u00a0 Kalyani Techpark, where the company\u2019s Bengaluru office was once located, has also sought more than INR 190 Cr in dues from  BYJU\u2019S  through its multiple entities. Notably, Surfer Technologies, which settled its insolvency case with BYJU\u2019S in June 2024, also figures in the list of operational creditors and has staked claim for INR 1.25 Cr.\u00a0 Additionally, Chinese smartphone makers OPPO and Vivo have also filed claims worth INR 16.64 Cr and INR 5.33 Cr, respectively.\u00a0 Meanwhile, both central and Karnataka tax authorities, spanning various departments, have  filed claims for dues worth more than INR 848 Cr  with the IRP. On top of that, as many as 1,784 employees of BYJU\u2019S have filed claims worth INR 301 Cr against the once poster child of the edtech ecosystem.\u00a0 After raising billions of dollars from investors at the height of the pandemic in 2021,  BYJU\u2019S went on a downhill path  as soon as capital dried up with the onset of funding winter. Meanwhile, reckless expansion and fruitless acquisitions led to ballooning losses even as revenues failed to grow commensurately.\u00a0 As a result, the company undertook major steps to cut costs, including mass layoffs, restructuring operations and shutting down centres, but to no avail. Making matters worse were delayed salaries, slew of legal and insolvency cases and a public standoff with investors.\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "The insolvency resolution professional (IRP) of  BYJU\u2019S  has reportedly ousted Glas Trust Co, a consortium of the troubled edtech startup\u2019s US-based lenders, from the committee of creditors (CoC). IRP Pankaj Srivastava took the step after concluding that Glas Trust did not represent the minimum 51% of lenders in the consortium, which provided the $1.2 Bn term loan B (TLB) to BYJU\u2019S, Economic Times reported citing sources.\u00a0 The development came to pass during the first meeting of the committee of creditors on Tuesday (August 3). As per a separate Times of India report, Glas Trust recently moved the Bengaluru bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking Srivastava\u2019s removal as the IRP.\u00a0 In an application filed with the tribunal on August 30, the lenders called for Srivastava\u2019s ouster saying that he failed to comply with current bankruptcy rules, which stipulate that the first meeting of the committee shall be held within seven days of the constitution of the CoC.\u00a0 The matter will now reportedly be heard on Wednesday (September 4). Meanwhile, sources told ET that BYJU\u2019S has disqualified most of the lenders represented by Glas Trust, citing the edtech major\u2019s right under the credit agreement to exclude \u201cpredatory lenders focussed on distressed debt\u201d. Another person privy to the development reportedly said that Glas Trust no longer meets the required threshold to pursue its claims against BYJU\u2019S due to lender disqualifications. \u201cThe obligation of the parent company to repay the loan as a guarantor would only arise upon a legitimate acceleration, which has not yet been established,\u201d added the source.\u00a0 Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the steering committee of the TLB lenders told ET, \u201cMr Pankaj Srivastava\u2019s actions are unprecedented and entirely illegitimate as no interim resolution professional in the history of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code of India has ever attempted to unlawfully strip financial creditors of claims of this magnitude amounting to more than $1.35 Bn without any legitimate reason and in doing so securing his appointment as the permanent resolution professional.\u201d\u00a0 The spokesperson further added, \u201cThe term loan lenders are hopeful that this wrongful conduct will not be permitted to prevail and will ensure that such blatant mistreatment does not go unchallenged\u201d. For the uninitiated, the edtech major raised a $1.2 Bn TLB in 2021. Subsequently, as its losses mounted and capital dried up due to funding winter, the company halted payments and filed a suit against its creditors.\u00a0 On the other hand, its US lenders have accused the company\u2019s founder and CEO Byju Raveendran of diverting more than $500 Mn from the TLB corpus. The creditors have even filed a bankruptcy case against the company\u2019s American arm, BYJU\u2019S Alpha, in the US. Mounting further offence in a bid to claw back the funds, the consortium of creditors also appealed before the Supreme Court (SC) to quash an INR 158 Cr settlement between the edtech firm and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in connection with the edtech\u2019s insolvency proceedings. Last month, the  SC revived the insolvency proceedings  against the embattled startup.\u00a0 BYJU\u2019S, once the darling of investors, spent millions of dollars on acquiring companies, launching an advertising blitzkrieg and expanding operations at the height of the pandemic. However, growth stagnated as schools reopened.\u00a0 Meanwhile, a  funding crunch deepened the crisis at the company , forcing BYJU\u2019S to layoff employees in droves, cut corners and shut down offline centres. Making matters worse is the bevy of legal cases, mounting losses, a public spat with investors and delayed salaries of employees for months.\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Hours after the insolvency resolution professional of  BYJU\u2019S   ousted US-based lenders\u2019 representative Glas Trust from its committee of creditors , the latter has said the move is \u201cunlawful\u201d \u2014 alleging that Pankaj Srivastava is \u201csecretly plotting\u201d to reject its $1.35 Bn claims against the troubled edtech startup. Reports surfaced yesterday (September 3) that Srivastava, the interim resolution professional of BYJU\u2019S, unseated Glas Trust from the creditors\u2019 committee.\u00a0 The decision came after Srivastava reportedly concluded that Glas Trust did not represent the minimum 51% of US-based lenders that extended the $1.2 Bn term loan B to BYJU\u2019S. However, the lenders have described Srivastava\u2019s actions as \u201cfraudulent\u201d and \u201cillegitimate\u201d. \u201cPankaj Srivastava\u2019s actions are unprecedented and entirely illegitimate as no interim resolution professional in the history of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code of India has ever attempted to unlawfully strip financial creditors of claims of this magnitude amounting to more than US$1.35 billion without any legitimate reason and in doing so securing his appointment as the permanent resolution professional,\u201d the steering committee of lenders said. According to the lenders, Srivastava had previously confirmed that the claim filed by Glas Trust on their behalf\u00a0 amounting to INR 11,432.98 Cr (about $1.35 Bn) had been verified and admitted and that Glas Trust was \u201cundoubtedly\u201d a member of the CoC. However, Srivastava abruptly cut off all communication to the lenders\u00a0 on August 27 and ignored all efforts to reach him to check-in on the status of the insolvency process, Glas Trust alleged. The lenders further alleged that Srivastava \u201cmisled and blindsided\u201d Glas Trust and lenders by moving the first CoC meeting\u00a0 9 hours earlier without giving any notice. Meanwhile, Glas Trust has moved the Bengaluru bench of the NCLT seeking Srivastava\u2019s removal as the IRP, alleging he failed to comply with current bankruptcy rules. The matter is due for hearing today (September 4). At the heart of this dispute is the $1.2 Bn debt raised by BYJU\u2019S in 2021. However, amid mounting losses and a cash crunch, the company suspended payments and filed a suit against its creditors. On the other hand, its US lenders have  accused the company\u2019s founder and CEO Byju Raveendran of diverting more than $500 Mn  from the TLB corpus. The creditors have even filed a bankruptcy case against the company\u2019s American arm, BYJU\u2019S Alpha, in the US. In an effort to recover the funds, Glas Trust moved the Supreme Court to quash an INR 158 Cr settlement between the edtech firm and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in connection with the edtech\u2019s insolvency proceedings. Last month, the  SC revived the insolvency proceedings  against BYJU\u2019S. \u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Amid escalating tensions between  BYJU\u2019S  insolvency resolution professional and its US-based lenders, the Bengaluru bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has postponed its verdict on the petition filed by Glas Trust, seeking a stay on further meetings of the committee of creditors (CoC). Glas Trust, a consortium of US-based lenders that extended a $1.2 Bn term loan B to BYJU\u2019S parent company Think & Learn Pvt Ltd in 2021, was  reportedly ousted from the creditors\u2019 committee  within minutes of its first meeting on September 3. Pankaj Srivastava, the interim resolution professional, removed Glas Trust from the creditors\u2019 committee, claiming it did not represent the minimum 51%\u00a0 of the lenders in the consortium. During the hearing on September 4, Glas Trust\u2019s counsel contended Srivastava\u2019s move, saying his actions undermined the tribunal\u2019s authority and urged it to halt further meetings of the CoC, Moneycontrol reported.\u00a0 \u00a0 However, the bench of Justices K Biswal and Manoj Kumar Dubey, deferred the hearing to September 11 and refused to stay the CoC meetings, citing the Supreme Court order that had allowed the formation of the CoC.\u00a0 The NCLT reportedly asked Glas Trust to file a fresh plea challenging its exclusion from the creditor\u2019s committee if it wished to pursue the matter. It is pertinent to note that the Supreme Court last month  overturned the NCLAT\u2019s ruling  that quashed the bankruptcy proceedings against BYJU\u2019S and approved an INR 158.9 Cr settlement between the debt-ridden edtech firm and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).\u00a0 Earlier today, Glas Trust  accused BYJU\u2019S resolution professional of secretly plotting to reject the US lenders\u2019 $1.35 Bn claim  against the troubled edtech startup. Calling Srivastava\u2019s actions \u201cfraudulent\u201d, the lenders alleged that he manipulated the process by moving up the CoC meeting by nine hours and failed to notify either Glas Trust or its advisors about the same. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

        "Article Content": "India\u2019s healthcare system is experiencing a financial crisis. A NITI Aayog report revealed that Indians paid over $72 Bn out-of-pocket for healthcare expenses, making out-of-pocket expenditure (OoPE) one of the largest financial burdens for Indian households.\u00a0 This high expense frequently pushes families into debt and poverty. Unlike consumer goods, where financing options like \u201cno-cost EMIs\u201d are easily available, healthcare financing has been left behind. This disparity leaves many patients deferring essential treatments due to a lack of financial resources, aggravating health issues and increasing long-term medical costs. In India, people often rely on savings, loans from friends and family, or high-interest loans to cover the costs of healthcare. Some customers have access to credit cards as a potential solution. However, many are deterred by the high interest rates and fees associated with them, compounded by the requirement to repay credit card expenditures within a 30\u201345-day window.\u00a0 There is an urgent need to fill the gap in healthcare finance choices by making them more accessible and affordable. With the rise of  Buy Now, Pay Later  (BNPL)\u00a0services or affordability financing, a game-changing option has emerged to close this gap. BNPL provides a more convenient and easier alternative for people to pay for their medical bills, without requiring a good credit score or paying excessive interest rates. Lenders have integrated with healthcare providers to build subjection trades providing zero interest models for end consumers. A few of the main advantages are as follows: Zero Percent Interest Rate Financing:  One of the most attractive features of BNPL in healthcare is the 0% interest rate. This makes healthcare financing more affordable, removing the financial strain associated with high-interest credit card payments. Improved Access To Healthcare:  By spreading the cost of treatment over a series of instalments, BNPL allows more patients to access necessary medical services without the need to defer care due to immediate financial constraints. This can lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment, improving overall health outcomes. Players in this sector are now capable of providing up to Rs.10 lakh to patients and families for healthcare treatments. Increased Financial Flexibility:  Patients can manage their finances better with BNPL, avoiding the need to dip into savings or take out high-interest loans. This financial flexibility is crucial in a country where a significant portion of the population lacks health insurance or sufficient coverage, bridging the gap between insurance provisions and treatment costs.\u00a0 Enhanced Patient Experience:  BNPL services can significantly enhance the patient experience by reducing the stress and anxiety associated with large medical expenses. This peace of mind can positively impact recovery and overall well-being. The future of BNPL in healthcare looks promising, with several trends indicating continued growth and innovation: Integration With Embedded Finance:  Embedded finance, which integrates financial services into non-financial platforms, is set to transform healthcare transactions. By embedding BNPL options directly within healthcare providers\u2019 payment systems, the process becomes seamless for patients, enhancing accessibility and convenience. Regulatory Evolution:  As BNPL services grow, regulatory frameworks will evolve to ensure consumer protection and the sustainability of the business model. This could lead to more standardised practices and increased trust in BNPL options among consumers. Technological Advancements:  Advances in technology, particularly in fintech, will drive innovation in BNPL services. Enhanced data analytics and  AI  can improve  credit risk  assessments, personalise financing options and streamline the approval process, making BNPL more efficient and user-friendly. Increased Adoption By Healthcare Providers:  As the benefits of BNPL become more apparent, more healthcare providers are likely to adopt these services. This adoption will be driven by the dual advantages of increased patient satisfaction and higher revenue from treatments that might otherwise be postponed or foregone. Expansion Into Rural and Underserved Areas:  BNPL has the potential to significantly impact rural and less fortunate populations by providing financial solutions where traditional credit systems are less prevalent. This can democratise access to healthcare, ensuring that more people receive timely and adequate medical care. There has been a sea change in the way healthcare is funded in India and it all started with BNPL services. A major issue in healthcare is affordability, which BNPL aims to solve by providing zero-interest financing options. In the future, BNPL will play a crucial role in healthcare financing, caused by the\u00a0developments in embedded finance, legislative backing and technology breakthroughs.\u00a0 While this change guarantees improved health results and a more equal healthcare system, it also increases the financial burden on patients. It has the potential to completely transform healthcare availability and cost as it gains momentum, bringing better medical care to more people in India.\u00a0",

As per ET\u2019s report, the round also saw participation from its existing investors, including Endiya Partners, among others. The report said the company is planning to deploy the newly raised funds to expand its geographical footprint, broaden product portfolio and support regulatory clearances. Inc42 has reached out to SigTuple for comments on the development. The story will be updated based on the response. Founded in 2015 by Apurv Anand, Bharath Cheluvaraju, Rohit Kumar Pandey and Tathagato Dastidar, SigTuple makes AI-driven smart robotic microscopes to automate the manual process in clinical laboratories. The medtech company is backed by Accel Partners, Chiratae Ventures, Endiya Partners, pi Ventures, Venture Highway, and a few others. Prior to the current round of funding, the Bengaluru-based medtech company  raised  $4.3 Mn in a fresh funding round led by its existing investors Endiya Partners and Accel to expand its geographical footprint and product portfolio, over a year ago. SigTuple also has plans to enter the point-of-care (PoC) market in the following year, to leverage into microfluidic technology and imaging to conduct essential tests within minutes, the report said. Healthtech companies have been in the race of expanding their operations to new locations and have consistently made efforts to raise funds this year. Earlier today, online healthcare service provider Visit Health  secured  INR 250 Cr (nearly $29.8 Mn) from PB Fintech\u2019s arm Docprime Technologies in a mix of capital infusion and secondary purchase of shares.",

In his new role, Lodha will lead Medikabazaar\u2019s growth targets, international expansion and drive profitability. He will oversee the Indian market while strengthening the company\u2019s product portfolio and operations.\u00a0 With over two decades of experience, he served with medical devices maker TI Medical and knitwear brand Rupa And Company Limited as group CEO.

        "Article Content": "Bengaluru-based agritech startup  CropIn  has partnered with Google Gemini to roll out a real time GenAI-powered agri intelligence platform to help customers manage farms globally by predicting yields, disease and other key insights.\u00a0 \u201cSage provides detailed, grid-based insights into crop behavior over different timeframes. By integrating generative AI, advanced crop and climate models, and Earth observation data, Sage helps customers make informed decisions about crop suitability and yield potential,\u201d founder and CEO Krishna Kumar told Inc42. Incorporated in 2010 by Krishna Kumar and Kunal Prasad,  CropIn  is a SaaS-based agtech startup which helps farm-to-fork businesses digitise their operations and make informed decisions that enhance farming efficiency, productivity and sustainability. It claims to have partnered with more than 250 B2B customers, digitised 30 Mn acres of farmlands, benefitting over 7 Mn farmers worldwide. CropIn Sage claims to generate a proprietary grid-based map for agricultural data, offering unparalleled scale, accuracy and speed. This transforms the way stakeholders understand crop dynamics, climate impacts, and optimal agricultural practices, enabling informed decisions in multiple languages.\u00a0 By offering detailed historical performance analysis and precise regional insights, Sage eliminates uncertainty in food production planning, enhancing efficiency and sustainability in agriculture, the company said in a statement. This platform will help CPG players, seed manufacturers, food processors and governments to formulate informed decisions using historical, current and future data on crops, irrigation, climate and soil, thereby future-proofing production and supply chains.\u00a0 Enterprise customers can use Sage to gather intelligence across multiple geographic locations, focusing on 13 key crops such as wheat, rice, potato, and maize, which collectively account for nearly 80% of global food demand, it added.\u00a0 The platform aims to deploy globally in phases to meet enterprise demand. Currently B2B, CropIn\u2019s platform will soon expand to B2C.\u00a0 Beyond this, Sage will forecast future crop yields using advanced AI, pinpointing optimal global locations and conditions for cultivation to enhance food system resilience and sustainability. Sage utilises Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to scale operations dynamically, handling large data volumes in real-time. Additionally, it employs the Gemini Flash 1.5 model to convert user queries into SQL queries, facilitating the generation of user-friendly, visually appealing, grid-based data across various temporal frequencies tailored to customer needs. Another user case of Sage is that it acts as a crucial defense for global food systems, providing intelligence to address crop performance issues promptly and secure supply chains for food manufacturers, particularly in challenging seasons, added Kumar. With the platform\u2019s launch, the founder anticipates increasing the customer base by 50% over the next 2-3 years and aims to double the revenue. \u201cSage is poised to address pressing issues of food security and sustainability, positioning itself as a premium product in the years ahead,\u201d the founder and CEO said. The development comes months after CropIn introduced \u2018 aksara ,\u2019 an open-source micro language model aimed at supporting climate-smart agriculture. This solution targets issues faced by farmers in the global south, promoting sustainability by enabling the development of affordable and scalable AI solutions across the agriculture sector. CropIn has raised a total of $47 Mn in funding to date, with $34 Mn raised in the last two rounds, of which approximately 40% was utilised to enhance intelligence capabilities and expand scalable assets. In December 2022, the startup  raised $14 Mn funding  from a clutch of investors, including Google and JSR Corporation. Prior to that, in 2021, CropIn  netted $20 Mn in its Series C funding round  led by Singapore-based private equity firm and impact investor ABC World Asia.",

        "Article Content": "The Centre is planning to set up an INR 750 Cr Category-II Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) to help startups operating in the agriculture and allied sectors. Dubbed \u2018Agri Fund For Startups and Rural Enterprises\u2019, the fund will offer both equity and debt support to agritech startups, with a special emphasis on high-risk, high impact activities in the agriculture value chain, PTI reported. Addressing the pre-launch stakeholder meet held on Friday at NABARD headquarters in Mumbai, Ajeet Kumar Sahu, joint secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, reportedly said that the initiative is aimed at spurring innovation and sustainability in the agriculture sector. The official further said that the fund, when launched, would also open new opportunities for small and marginal farmers in terms of investment and innovation. The development comes a year after the government announced  an agriculture-focused accelerator fund to encourage such startups in the rural parts of the country . However, the government didn\u2019t declare any tax incentives for agritech players, which the industry is hoping will be announced in this year\u2019s Budget. It is pertinent to note that the Indian agricultural sector accounts for nearly 16% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and employs nearly 44% of the national workforce.\u00a0 While the sector is still plagued by old-age practices and obsolete technology, homegrown agritech startups are trying to transform the Indian agriculture landscape, offering innovative digital solutions from providing weather-based crop advisory to soil analysis and from promoting IoT-enabled practices to AI-driven technology. The fast-growing agriculture sector is expected to become a $24  Bn opportunity by 2025 . According to the Economic Survey 2022-23, there are more than 1,000 agritech startups in the country. Some of the notable startups in the space include AgroStar, Fasal, CropIn, Dehaat, Ergos, KisanKonnect, Ninjacart, Waycool, FarMart, and Gramophone. \u00a0",

Going forward this fiscal, crop survey will be undertaken using the digital public infrastructure (DPI) in 400 districts in the ongoing Kharif season, added Sitharaman. Via the DPI, details of 6 Cr farmers and their land parcels will be collected and the said farmers will be brought under the ambit of the farm and land registry. In addition, the DPI will be utilised to offer Kisan credit cards to farmers.\u00a0 Notably, a pilot of the agri DPI was launched last year, when the Centre asked states and union territories (UTs) to digitise the process of area enumeration of crops at the field level. The FM also proposed development of multiple other DPI applications at \u201cpopulation scale for productivity gains, business opportunities, and innovation by the private sector\u201d. These new public digital goods will cater to sectors such as credit, ecommerce, education, health, law and justice, logistics, MSME, services delivery, and urban governance, she added.\u00a0 Till date, the Centre has operationalised a slew of DPIs including Aadhaar, e-KYC, UPI, Bharat QR, account aggregator, and the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). Meanwhile, the Budget also saw multiple other announcements for Indian startups, including the  abolition of angel tax ,  reduction of the tax deducted at source (TDS)  for ecommerce platforms to 0.1% from 1% earlier, and an  additional cut in basic customs duty (BCD) rates  on several mobile phone parts.

This will be a continual process,\u201d a WayCool spokesperson told Inc42 in a statement. \u201cThe company has already received 75% of the capital from its bridge round and will complete the round by August. This gives it adequate capital runway to get past the cash profitability milestone,\u201d the spokesperson added. Founded in 2015 by Karthik Jayaraman and Sanjay Dasari, WayCool is an agritech company that sells its food products under seven different labels, while also offering supply chain tech solutions. The company has raised a total funding of around $300 Mn so far, and is backed by investors such as Lightrock, Lightbox, Lightsmith, 57 Stars, and FMO. Sources attributed the latest layoff exercise to the company\u2019s worsening financial woes, including delayed salaries and client payments, the report said. Last year, it was reported that WayCool  fired  300 employees in a restructuring exercise. Back then TOI reported that the startup, which raised more than $350 Mn in funding, has conducted the restructuring to chase profitability.",

        "Article Content": "Dairy product startup  Country Delight  has secured INR 70 Cr\u00a0 ($ 8.35 Mn) in debt funding from Alteria Capital. The fresh capital injection comes as the startup reports strong revenue growth and aims for profitability in the near future. According to regulatory filings, Country Delight\u2019s board has approved the issuance of 7,000 non-convertible debentures (NCDs) at INR 1,00,000 each to raise the funds.\u00a0 This debt infusion follows a  INR 76 Cr mixed debt and equity round from Alteria Capital  in May, solidifying the investor\u2019s continued confidence in the startup\u2019s growth trajectory. The latest funding comes amid Country Delight\u2019s robust financial performance. Inc42 recently reported that the startup achieved an  operating revenue of INR 650 Cr  in the first half of FY24.\u00a0 This puts Country Delight on track to surpass its FY23 revenue of INR 900 Cr, which itself represented a 66% year-on-year growth from FY22. Interestingly, Country Delight is eyeing profitability in the near term. Sources indicate that the startup expects to reach EBITDA breakeven by the end of H1 2025.\u00a0 This aligns with earlier statements from cofounder Chakradhar Gade, who said in September 2023 that the company would turn profitable within 8-10 months. Founded in 2013 by Gade and Nitin Kaushal, Country Delight operates on a subscription-based model, delivering milk and other daily essentials directly from farmers to consumers.\u00a0 The startup has expanded its operations to about 15 cities, including Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Jaipur, Chennai, and Pune. Country Delight\u2019s growth story has attracted significant investor interest. Earlier this year, the startup raised $20 million as part of its Series E round, which valued the company at approximately $758 million.\u00a0 The round saw participation from existing investors Temasek and Venturi Partners. In a separate development, Orios Venture Partners made a partial exit from Country Delight in February, scoring a 45X return on its initial investment.\u00a0 The early-stage VC firm sold a 3% stake to Temasek for around INR 225 Cr, while still retaining the majority of its stake from Fund I in the company. It faces competition from companies like Akshayakalpa, Milk Mantra, Sid\u2019s Farm, and Otipy, among others.",

The round also saw participation from Capria Ventures, Thai Wah Ventures and existing investor Ankur Capital. Agrizy plans to use the fresh funds to expand into new products and regions. It also plans to launch contract manufacturing and advisory services, and offer financial services to MSME processors and farmer-producer organisations (FPOs). Founded in 2021 by Vicky Dodani and Saket Chirania, Agrizy aims to bridge the processed agri supply chain by connecting agri suppliers, processors and buyers of agricultural products across food and non-food categories. The startup offers a digital marketplace for agri-products, custom sourcing of agri food products for buyers, demand aggregation for small processors and working capital support through partnerships with NBFCs. It also offers networking, logistics, warehousing services and automates payment cycles. Dodani said, \u201cAgrizy aims to make India a global food processing centre by helping FPOs and MSME agri-processors reach export markets and meet global quality standards. It will also provide these stakeholders working capital from formal financial institutions.\u201d In April 2022,  Agrizy raised $4 Mn in a seed funding  round led by Ankur Capital and a  $5 Mn debt funding from SBI , Yes Bank, Vivriti Capital, and other financial institutions, last year.Krishnan Neelakantan, Managing Partner, Ankur Capital, said,  Krishnan Neelakantan, managing partner, Ankur Capital, said, \u201cAs an early investor, working closely with Agrizy, we have been impressed with the team\u2019s ability to establish market fit and scale their business over the last two years. The company also\u00a0 demonstrates superior metrics on margins and capital efficiency. \u201c It is pertinent to note that the Indian agricultural sector accounts for nearly 16% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and employs nearly 44% of the national workforce.\u00a0 While the sector is still plagued by old-age practices and obsolete technology, homegrown agritech startups are trying to transform the Indian agriculture landscape, offering innovative digital solutions from providing weather-based crop advisory to soil analysis and from promoting IoT-enabled practices to AI-driven technology. The fast-growing agriculture sector is expected to become a  $24 Bn opportunity by 2025 . According to the Economic Survey 2022-23, there are more than 1,000 agritech startups in the country. Some of the notable startups in the space include AgroStar, Fasal, CropIn, Dehaat, Ergos, KisanKonnect, Ninjacart, Waycool, FarMart, and Gramophone.",

The startup\u2019s revenue from operations grew 89% to INR 34.1 Cr in the financial year 2023-24 (FY24) from INR 18 Cr in FY23. Founded by Shailendra Tiwari and Ananda Verma in 2018,  Fasal  is a precision horticulture platform that leverages AI, crop sciences and IoT to provide farm-level, crop-specific and crop-stage-specific intelligence to enable resource optimisation (water, pesticides, etc) and higher farm productivity.

Besides, it also earns revenue from sale of services through software subscription charges. According to its annual financial statements filed with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), Fasal earned over 90% of its revenue through the sale of agricultural goods, specifically fruits. Revenue from sale of fruits surged 126.5% to INR 30.8 Cr in FY24 from INR 13.6 Cr in FY23. Meanwhile, revenue from sale of IoT devices and components declined to INR 2.1 Cr during the year under review from INR 3.5 Cr in FY23. Revenue from services was almost flat at INR 1.1 Cr.

        "Article Content": "Rural fintech startup  Jai Kisan  has reportedly obtained a non-banking finance company (NBFC) licence after it bought a majority stake in supply chain financing company Kushal Finnovation Capital. As per ET\u2019s report, with this new NBFC licence, Jai Kisan can now offer tailored financial products such as loans from its own portfolio. The company will also be able to enter into co-lending partnerships with financial institutions, including public sector banks in India. It is pertinent to note that Jai Kisan\u2019s cofounder and chief executive Arjun Ahluwalia is a non-executive director of Kushal Finnovation Capital. Until now, Jai Kisan was able to cater services in partnership with banks in agreement and NBFCs through its portal, but the new licence enables the company to directly create and deliver tailored financial solutions to farmers and rural businesses, the report said, citing Ahluwalia. Founded in 2020 by Ahluwalia and Adriel Maniego, Jai Kisan is a rural India-focussed neo bank that offers credit solutions in online and offline rural commerce environments. It aims to offer full-stack financial services to individuals and businesses in rural areas of the country. In April 2020, Jai Kisan launched a digital lender for rural businesses called Bharat Khata. Under its BNPL credit solution, the startup is said to have added 400% new customers into its base in the initial three months. \u201cThe NBFC licence allows us to cater to our farmer and rural business customers with credit products they want, how they want them, when they want them and where they want them \u2013 which is what they deserve,\u201d the report quoted Ahluwalia as saying by the publication. This comes at a time when the Reserve Bank of India has heightened its scrutiny in regulating fintech platforms in the country. Meanwhile, Bengaluru-based neobank Fi  secured  its NBFC licence from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in April. Ahluwalia also confirmed to the report that the company is planning a new fundraise in the next two to three quarters, primarily to support the operationalisation of the NBFC, without disclosing the financial details. As of the last  fundraising  in 2022, the Mumbai-based Jai Kisan has secured $85.4 Mn (nearly INR 717 Cr). ",

It must be noted that WayCool incurred a non-cash expenditure of INR 1,906 Cr and INR 827.8 Cr in FY23 and FY22, respectively. These non-cash expenditure items have been removed to calculate the net loss numbers. Including the non-cash expenses, net loss in FY23 surged 118% to INR 2,591.6 Cr in FY23 from INR 1,190 Cr in FY22.

It is backed by investors such as Lightrock, Lightbox, Lightsmith, 57 Stars, and FMO. WayCool launched its FMCG entity BrandsNext Last year, which houses brands such as Madhuram, KITCHENji, DeziFresh, and Freshey\u2019s.\u00a0 It was reported last year that the agritech startup was in talks to raise around $50 Mn-$70 Mn at a valuation of around $900 Mn.

        "Article Content": "After a delay of more than three years, India\u2019s Digital Agriculture Mission (DAM) is finally shaping up. The Union Cabinet has approved the INR 2,817 Cr mission for the creation of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) to supercharge the Indian agriculture sector.\u00a0 Originally planned for launch in the financial year 2021-22 (FY22), the digital agriculture mission was reportedly delayed as Covid-19 pandemic swept through the country and put the plans on the back burner.\u00a0 But, the mission was thrusted into headlines earlier this year as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget speech,  reiterated the full-scale roll out of a digital public infrastructure  (DPI) for the agriculture sector. That said, the Centre has now set the ball rolling to build DPIs that will offer farmer-centric digital services, relay timely and reliable information to farmers, among others. Leveraging emerging technologies such as data analytics, artificial intelligence and remote sensing, the project has been approved with a total outlay of INR 2,817 Cr, of which the Centre will contribute around INR 1,940 Cr. \u201cThe DPI for Agriculture aims to provide comprehensive and useful data on farmers comprising authenticated demographic details, land holdings and crops sown. It will include cultivators and tenant farmers, as per the policy of the state government\u2026 Aligned with the vision of Viksit Bharat@2047, the DPI for agriculture forms the core of the Digital Agriculture Mission,\u201d said an official statement. Part of the agriculture ministry\u2019s activities planned for the first 100 days of the new union government, the mission will be rolled out across the country over the next two years (until FY26). But what is the government\u2019s much touted Digital Agriculture Mission and how will it disrupt the ailing Indian farm sector? Modelled on the lines of other DPIs such as Aadhaar and unified payments interface (UPI), the DAM will be built on three key pillars, which include AgriStack, Krishi Decision Support System (DSS), and Soil Profile Maps.\u00a0 Complementing this will be the Digital General Crop Estimation Survey (DGCES), which will look to create a tech-based ecosystem to provide accurate estimates of agricultural production by leveraging \u201cscientifically designed crop-cutting experiments\u201d.\u00a0 The first cornerstone of the digital agriculture mission will be the creation of AgriStack, a farmer-centric DPI that will allow farmers to access services in an efficient, easy, and faster manner. Additionally, it has been envisaged with streamlining delivery of schemes to farmers.\u00a0 To be built and maintained by state and union territory (UT) governments, AgriStack will comprise three \u201cfoundational registries or databases\u201d pertaining to the sector. These include: However, work is already underway to operationalise these databases. In an official statement, the Ministry of Agriculture said that so far memorandums of understanding (MoUs) have been signed between the Centre and as many 19 states to create and implement the DPI.\u00a0 The government claims to have already built the basic IT infrastructure for implementing the AgriStack, adding that the project has already been tested on a pilot basis in multiple states.\u00a0 For instance, trials have already been conducted for the creation of Farmer IDs across six states including Uttar Pradesh (Farrukhabad), Gujarat (Gandhinagar), Maharashtra (Beed), Haryana (Yamuna Nagar), Punjab (Fatehgarh Sahib), and Tamil Nadu (Virudhnagar).\u00a0 Additionally, a pilot Digital Crop Survey was conducted across 11 states in FY24 to aid the development of the Crop Sown Registry. Going forward, the Agriculture Ministry has set its eyes on pan-India roll out of the survey by FY26, with 400 districts slated to be covered under the survey in the ongoing fiscal (FY25).\u00a0 Overall, the Centre plans to create digital identities for 11 Cr farmers under the project in the next three years, including 6 Cr in FY25, 3 Cr in FY26 and 2 Cr IDs in FY27.\u00a0 This DPI will pave the way for the creation of a comprehensive geospatial ecosystem to bring all remote sensing-based information on one platform including data on crop, soil, weather, water resources, among others. The Digital Agriculture Mission will also create\u00a0 detailed soil profile maps (on a 1:10,000 scale) spanning across nearly 142 Mn hectares of India\u2019s agricultural land. As per the Ministry, a detailed soil profile inventory of about 29 Mn hectares has already been completed. The Agriculture Ministry expects the Digital Agriculture Mission to have a \u201ccatalytic\u201d effect on the creation of both direct and indirect employment in the sector.\u00a0 It estimates that projects under the mission, including digital crop surveys and collection of \u201cground-truthed\u201d data for remote sensing, will provide employment opportunities to about 2.5 Lakh trained local youth and \u201cKrishi Sakhis\u201d. Besides, the agri-focussed DPIs will enable farmers to easily authenticate themselves digitally to access benefits and services. This, the government believes, will obviate cumbersome paperwork and need to physically visit various offices.\u00a0 As such, farmers can access a range of services online such as crop loans, connecting to agri-input suppliers and buyers of agricultural produce, accessing personalised advisories in real time, among others.\u00a0 \u201cThe trustful data would help government agencies make schemes and services more efficient and transparent, such as paperless MSP-based procurement, crop insurance, and credit card-linked crop loans, and develop systems for the balanced use of fertilisers, etc,\u201d added a statement. Alongside, data from digital crop survey, DGCES and remote-sending data will help in estimating crop production, thereby facilitating crop diversification and evaluating irrigation needs as per crop and season. Meanwhile, the government plans to leverage Krishi decision support system to identify crop sown patterns, drought and flood monitoring and technology-based yield assessment for settling crop insurance claims by farmers. \u201cThe DPI for agriculture developed under the Mission will enable the stakeholders in the agriculture ecosystem to establish efficient value chains for agricultural inputs and post-harvest processes, as also in developing solutions for customised advisory services to farmers relating to crop planning, crop health, pest and disease management, and irrigation requirements, ensuring that our farmers receive the best possible and timely guidance and services,\u201d added the Ministry.\u00a0 While it remains to be seen whether the Digital Agriculture Mission is able to emulate the success of UPI, all eyes will be on how the Centre effectively works out the implementation of the scheme.\u00a0 That said, the move will also pave the way for Indian agritechs to leverage this data and build products on top of the stack. Home to 1,000+ agritech startups, the DPI is expected to push the needle on the homegrown agritech economy which, as per Inc42, is  projected to be a $25 Bn opportunity by 2025 .\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Online travel aggregator (OTA)  Easemytrip  has incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary Easy Green Mobility to foray into the electric bus manufacturing market. The traveltech major said it will invest INR 200 Cr for R&D, product development, and setting up a manufacturing plant over the next 2-3 years. Easy Green Mobility will manufacture ebuses and operate via EaseMyTrip\u2019s other subsidiary YoloBus. EaseMyTrip acquired the inter-city travel platform YoloBus in 2021. Currently, the platform has a network covering over 250 routes across the country. Easy Green Mobility plans to build a plant with a capacity of producing 4,000-5,000 ebuses in the initial phase. The production capacity will be ramped up going forward. Following the announcement, shares of EaseMyTrip jumped over 12% to touch an intraday high of INR 44.3 on the BSE. It is pertinent to note that the development comes when the country\u2019s EV industry is expanding rapidly. After the surge in adoption of electric two-wheelers over the last few years, the government is now focusing more towards electrification of public vehicles. With the foray in the ebus manufacturing segment, EasyMyTrip will lock horns with its OTA competitor ixigo. While ixigo is not in the business of manufacturing ebuses, it is one of the backers of ebus operator Fresh Bus. EasyMyTrip\u2019s newest subsidiary Easy Green Mobility will also compete with publicly listed players Olectra Greentech, Ashok Leyland\u2019s subsidiary Switch Mobility, Tata Motors, and a few other automotive giants. Commenting on the new launch, Rikant Pittie, cofounder of EaseMyTrip, said that the demand for ebuses will grow to 1,25,000 to 1,50,000 units per annum in a decade.\u00a0 \u201cThe current market dynamics present a significant opportunity to enhance supply and meet the growing demand for electric buses by localising production and creating a fully \u2018Make-In-India\u2019 product,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough the FAME scheme, state-level policies and PLI schemes, the government is encouraging the adoption of electric buses across the country.\u201d\u00a0 It is worth noting that the  FAME-III subsidy scheme , which is still under discussion at the central government level, is expected to have a heightened focus on subsidies ebuses and etrucks. Pittie said that the move to enter ebus manufacturing space aligns with the startup\u2019s plans to expand the non-air business and will help EaseMyTrip establish a strong foothold in the growing EV and emobility sector. Easy Green Mobility will leverage EaseMyTrip\u2019s brand presence and industry expertise to play a role in the dynamic EV market. The company aims to integrate cutting-edge technology with robust manufacturing practices to produce high-performance ebuses to enhance efficiency, safety, and passenger comfort. By 2027-28, the company targets to operate over 2,000 ebuses across the country. EaseMyTrip posted  a net profit of INR 33.9 Cr in the June quarter  (Q1) of FY25 on an operating revenue of INR 152.6 Cr. Recently, the startup also  acquired a 5% stake in B2B travel Portal E-Trav Tech Limited  as part of its aim to diversify its portfolio in the non-air segments.\u00a0 Earlier this year, EaseMyTrip also launched a new insurance broking subsidiary, EaseMyTrip Insurance Broker Private Limited.",

        "Article Content": "Shares of Bhavish Aggarwal-led  Ola  Electric plunged as much as 4% to INR 105.10 apiece during the intraday trading session on the BSE today (September 9) as its one-month share lock-in period ended today. Following the expiration of the lock-in period, around 18.18 Cr shares, or 4% of the company\u2019s outstanding equity, will become eligible for trading, according to a note from Nuvama Alternative and Quantitative Research.\u00a0 On August 9, Ola Electric Mobility\u2019s  shares made a flat debut on the bourses  as the stock got listed at INR 75.99 on the BSE, same as the issue price. However, after the flat listing, shares of the company witnessed a huge rally. The stock hit a record high of INR 157.53 on August 20.\u00a0 On the final day of bidding, the company\u2019s public issue was oversubscribed 4.27X, with the strongest interest received from qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). It is pertinent to note that Ola Electric\u2019s  consolidated net loss widened 30% to INR 347 Cr  in the June quarter of the financial year 2024-25 (Q1 FY25) from INR 267 Cr in the year-ago quarter. With its EV 3W bet, the company will look to chart a course to profitability.\u00a0 On the back of a robust growth in its vehicle sales, Ola Electric\u2019s operating revenue jumped over 90% to INR 5,009.8 Cr during the year under review from INR 2,630.9 Cr in FY23, as per the company\u2019s red herring prospectus (RHP) filed on July 26. This comes at a time when Ola electric has been foraying into newer segments, along with a slew of developments. For instance  Ola Electric  is  gearing  up to enter the electric three-wheeler (3W) market to take on the likes of Euler Motors, Piaggio, Mahindra Electric, among others. Apart from the passenger version, Ola Electric is also expected to launch a goods carrier variant of its 3W EV to cater to its diverse clientele, as per the report.",

        "Article Content": "Online travel aggregator (OTA)  Yatra  has said that the acquisition of Globe Travels will add 350 new corporate clients to its existing customer base, taking the total tally of corporate customers to 1,200. Last week, the company said that it will acquire corporate travel services provider Globe Travel for INR 128 Cr in an all-cash deal.\u00a0 In an investor presentation on Friday (September 6), Yatra said that the acquisition is expected to be \u201cimmediately accretive\u201d to its financials. Globe Travels will add an annual gross merchandise value (GMV) of INR 783 Cr, with business-to-business (B2B) total GMV now exceeding 50% of total GMV of Yatra. With minimal overlap in customer base, the acquisition will also open up cross-selling opportunities across hotels, expense management and travel solutions, it added. \u00a0 Founded in 1981, Globe Travels is one of India\u2019s oldest hospitality management companies, which also operates in sectors such as corporate travel, car rental and cargo freight forwarding. However, a majority of its business is currently offline. As part of the agreement, Yatra will integrate its corporate self booking platform with Globe Travels, driving efficiency and reducing costs for the latter\u2019s clients. Further, the acquisition will also strengthen Yatra\u2019s capabilities in Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE) with the combined entity emerging as one of the leading players in MICE by volumes, it said. The acquisition is part of Yatra\u2019s strategy to grow its market share and shore up revenue through strategic acquisitions. In its DRHP last year, Yatra said it would use the proceeds  from the IPO for strategic investments, acquisitions, and to fuel organic and inorganic growth initiatives In June this year, the company picked up an additional  45% stake in Adventure and Nature Network (ANN) , a prominent player in the adventure tourism sector. Prior to that, in 2017, Yatra acquired corporate travel service provider  Air Travel Bureau (ATB)  for an undisclosed amount. Founded in 2016 by Dhruv Shringi, Manish Amin and Sabina Chopra, Yatra is an OTA and India\u2019s largest corporate travel services provider. It competes with the likes of ixigo, EaseMyTrip, MakeMyTrip, Cleartip, among others. According to Inc42 data, the Delhi NCR-based startup has bagged a total funding of $151.56 Mn till date.\u00a0 Yatra reported a 32.5% decline in its consolidated net profit at INR 4.04 Cr in Q1 FY25 from  INR 5.99 Cr in the year-ago quarter . Revenue stood at INR 100.80 Cr in Q1 FY25, down 8.5% year-on-year (YoY) and 6.3% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). \u00a0",

After nine-year of his stint at the Flipkart Group, Krishnamurthi took to his LinkedIn profile to announce the resignation. \u201c Leading NextBuy is going to be a new kind of journey, and I can\u2019t wait to dive in with the team to solve for B2B e-commerce in India,\u201d Krishnamurthi said in his post. Krishnamurthi joined Flipkart in 2015 as the director for category marketing (electronics). Later, he served at various leadership positions at the company, including senior director for marketing in several verticals like fashion, electronics and home.\u00a0 In 2021, he was elevated to the position of CBO at Cleartrip.\u00a0 Prior to Flipkart, Krishnamurthi played several key roles, including at ITC Limited for seven years.\u00a0 Founded by Hrush Bhatt, Matthew Spacie and Stuart Crighton in 2006,  Cleartrip  is an online travel aggregator that allows users to book flight tickets and hotels. It was acquired by Walmart-owned Flipkart in 2021 for $40 Mn in a distressed sale.\u00a0 It is pertinent to note that Cleartrip has seen some key onboardings as well as resignations lately. For instance, a few months back, the company  onboarded  Anuj Rathi  as its chief business and growth officer. In April, the startup  announced  that its chief financial officer, Aditya Agarwal stepped down from his position. After his resignation, the role was taken over by former finance executive Akshat Mishra. In February, Cleartrip\u2019s chief executive officer Ayyappan Rajagopal  stepped down  from his position after serving the Flipkart Group for eleven years. As per the company, the position has not been filled by anyone yet. Cleartrip\u2019s  net loss surged  90% to INR 676.5 Cr in FY23 from INR 356.5 Cr in the previous fiscal year, marking a nearly 2X jump. \u00a0",

The partnership will allow users to browse bus routes offered by FlixBus at prices starting INR 99 through AbhiBus\u2019 platform.\u00a0 The development comes a week after FlixBus announced its  foray into the southern region of the country  with the launch of 14 new buses on six new routes via Bengaluru. In a statement, the startup said that the partnership with  Ixigo  will help it expand its reach into cities like Coimbatore, Madurai, Tirupati, and Vijayawada. \u201cWe are excited to join forces with AbhiBus, leveraging its strong foothold in South India to expand our reach into new regions. As part of our recent South India expansion, we have launched 6 new routes as inaugural connections in the region connecting 33 cities, further driving our growth. Together, we aim to offer Indian passengers convenient and affordable travel solutions that prioritise both comfort and sustainability,\u201d Flixbus India\u2019s managing director Surya Khurana said in a statement.\u00a0 Founded in 2011, FlixBus offers low-cost intercity bus services in more than 40 countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. In India, it began its journey in February this year with Delhi as its hub. Since then, it has expanded to 101 cities. This is FlixBus\u2019 second such partnership with a bus ticketing aggregator platform in India. In July, it  partnered fintech major Paytm  to allow users to book bus tickets through Paytm\u2019s app.\u00a0 Founded in 2008 by Sudhakar Reddy Chirra, AbhiBus provides end-to-end software and other value-added solutions such as eticketing systems, fleet management solutions, vehicle tracking systems, passenger information systems, and logistics management.\u00a0 It claims to be aggregating over 4,000+ private bus operators and 25 leading State RTCs, covering more than 350,000+ routes across the country The startup was acquired by ixigo in a  cash and stock deal  in 2021. The acquisition gave the listed travel tech startup rights over all intellectual property, brands, technology and operations of AbhiBus. Commenting on the partnership with FlixBus, AbhiBus COO Rohit Sharma said, \u201cThis partnership reflects the shared ambition of FlixBus and AbhiBus to revolutionise intercity travel in India by providing high-quality, yet affordable bus services. By combining FlixBus\u2019s premium offerings with our intuitive and user-friendly platform, we\u2019re elevating the travel experience for Indian passengers.\u201d\u00a0 Earlier this year, ixigo also expanded its partnership with PhonePe to offer flight and bus bookings on the latter\u2019s app. The partnership is anticipated to increase ixigo\u2019s revenue from its bus ticketing business. In the first quarter of the financial year 2024-25 (Q1 FY25), the startup\u2019s bus  ticketing revenue rose to INR 39.6 Cr  from INR 35.9 Cr in Q1 FY24.

        "Article Content": "IPO-bound  OYO  turned profitable in the financial year 2023-24 (FY24) as it managed to control its expenses by trimming its employee costs. The unicorn posted a net profit of INR 229.5 Cr during the year as against a net loss of INR 1,286.5 Cr in the previous financial year. OYO announced last month that it became profitable in FY24. However, its operating revenue remained almost flat during the year under review. Revenue from operations stood at INR 5,388.7 Cr in FY24, a decline of 1.3% from INR 5,463.9 Cr in the previous fiscal year, as per its filings with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Last month, the startup said that while its hotel count grew to  18,103 at the end of FY24 from 12,938 hotels  a year ago, the new hotels will take time to achieve their full potential. Including other income, OYO\u2019s total revenue declined 1% to INR 5,541.5 Cr from INR 5,601.7 Cr in FY23.\u00a0 Founded in 2012 by Ritesh Agarwal, OYO is a hospitality startup and claims to offer over 40 integrated products and solutions to patrons who operate more than 157K hotels and home storefronts in more than 35 countries, including India, Europe, and Southeast Asia. The startup managed to reduce its total expenditure by 16% to INR 5,725.7 Cr in FY24 from INR 6,799.6 Cr in the previous fiscal year.\u00a0 Lease Costs:  OYO\u2019s biggest expenditure was its lease costs, which accounted for 46% of the overall costs. This expense included service lease component and lease rentals. However, lease costs dropped 8% to INR 2,629.5 Cr from INR 2,843.3 Cr in FY23.\u00a0\u00a0 Employee Costs:  The primary reason behind the decline in total expenditure was the reduction in employee costs. Employee benefit expenses fell 52% to INR 744.3 Cr in FY24 from INR 1,548.8 Cr in the previous fiscal year. This decline was due to a 71.3% fall in employee share based expenses to INR 180.6 Cr in FY24 from INR 630.3 Cr in the previous fiscal year. Finance Costs:  OYO\u2019s finance cost rose 24% to INR 843.8 Cr during the year under review from INR 681.5 Cr in the previous fiscal year.\u00a0 Last month, Agarwal said  OYO is  looking to triple its profit after tax (PAT)  to INR 700 Cr in FY25.\u00a0 Recently, OYO raised INR 1,457 Cr (around $175 Mn) in a down round led by Agarwal floated Singapore-based entity Patient Capital, along with J&A Partners and ASK Financial Holdings. The latest funding saw OYO\u2019s valuation fall to $2.37 Bn from $10 Bn at its peak in 2019. The round also included July\u2019s INR 417 Cr investment from InCred in OYO.\u00a0 While OYO has been eyeing a public market listing for some time, its IPO has been deferred a couple of times now. Sources told Inc42 that the plans are  likely to be pushed back further  as the company  awaits the terms of the refinancing deal  for the $660 Mn Term Loan B availed by founder and CEO Agarwal to buy back shares from investors in 2019.\u00a0 As it prepares for its public listing, here\u2019s a deeper look at the executives responsible for the startup\u2019s growth.\u00a0",

        "Author URL": "https://inc42.com/author/suprita/",
        "Article Content": "Can you name the people behind Ola Electric? Beyond Bhavish Aggarwal, not many names come to mind.\u00a0 Ola, a brand valued at around $9 Bn, spans across Ola Consumer ( formerly Ola Cabs ) at $2 Bn,  Ola Electric  at close to $6 Bn, and Ola Krutrim at $1 Bn. Yet, aside from CEO Bhavish Aggarwal, and perhaps Ramkripa Ananthan head of vehicle design and Vishal Chaturvedi, business head of Ola cells who appeared at the  Ola Sankalp 2024 , there aren\u2019t many names that have made it to the headlines. At Ola Electric, for instance, the organisational structure is deep even with several decision-making layers. That\u2019s not a surprise given the breadth and depth of Ola Electric\u2019s operations.\u00a0 The company is looking to create a vertically integrated EV stack and as such there are three major components \u2014 manufacturing, battery or cell manufacturing and EV infrastructure such as charging stations.\u00a0 Away from the limelight, several noted industry players have come on board to direct the company in the post-IPO world. And it\u2019s not just about names, but how critical these functions are if Ola Electric has to prove the naysayers wrong.\u00a0 So, in that sense, these leaders will have their tasks cut out.\u00a0 Ola Electric\u2019s hiring strategy seemingly revolves around bringing in experts for its diverse operations, focusing on EV manufacturing, cell production, charging infrastructure, and R&D.\u00a0 With subsidiaries in Europe, the UK, and the US, Ola Electric is positioning itself as a major and resourceful player in the global EV race, while its domestic production arm, Ola Cell Technologies, aims to reduce import costs and secure supply chain independence. Still, the company\u2019s journey has faced some hurdles. As several of its key executives have joined in the last two years, frequent executive exits have raised concerns about its long-term stability. That\u2019s not surprising given the relatively young age of Ola Electric overall.\u00a0 Furthermore, while Ola Electric IPO was made a huge success by cutting down its valuation by 30%, the real problems of investors in terms of earning per share, EBITDA, and P/E ratio continue to haunt the company. And, this has started reflecting on the stock markets too Soon after its flat listing in the first half of August, the stock hit an all-time high on August 20 when it was trading at 157.53. In less than two weeks of listing, Ola Electric stock price had more than doubled, but now the stock is settling close to the INR 110 mark, over the potential long path to profitability.\u00a0 Despite impressive infrastructure, which includes 250 hypercharger stations across 17 states, 870 experience centres, cell manufacturing, the largest two-wheeler manufacturing capability in India and its technological prowess with 88 patents and 217 patent applications, Ola Electric has yet to present a profitable equation to investors. Before we delve into who heads what, it\u2019s important to understand the organisation structure. Over the past few years, Ola Electric has brought on Shaun William Calvert, former deputy CEO of Vietnam\u2019s Vinfast to oversee Ola FutureFactory. Calvert is responsible for leading a team of 874 women workers to keep things running smoothly at the core manufacturing unit for Ola Electric.\u00a0 Then, there\u2019s Hyun Shik Park, previously head of cell operations at LG\u2019s so-called Mother Factory at Ochang in South Korea. Park now leads the Ola Cells Gigafactory and even earns more than Aggarwal, showing just how critical he is to the company\u2019s future. While the gross salary of Aggarwal was INR 2.99 Cr in FY24, Park earned INR 8.7 Cr in FY24, the highest among senior management in the company and its subsidiaries. Additionally, Park received 17.3 lakh shares in Ola Electric during the fiscal year, potentially worth over INR 13 Cr to be vested in the next 4-5 years. While Calvert and Park joined Ola Electric last year, another key member is Suvonil Chatterjee, who once led design at Flipkart. Now the chief technology and product officer at Ola Electric since 2021, Chatterjee is seen as the second most influential figure in the Ola group.\u00a0 For instance, he has also played a key role in developing the Ola Krutrim platform and Ola Maps. Ramkripa Ananthan \u2014 many might have spotted her driving an Ola bike onto the stage at Ola Sankalp events. A former Mahindra designer who designed the likes of Mahindra Thar and Mahindra XUV 700 and now Ola bikes, Ananthan is a automobile designer-veteran and fittingly leads the vehicle design team at Ola Electric.\u00a0\u00a0 Harish Abichandani, a former CFO at Flipkart\u2019s Ekart division, has emerged as another key executive member at Ola Electric, where he has been leading the finance department since last year. Abichandani has been associated with Ola Electric for the past six years in various capacities. He currently serves as a director for several Ola entities, including Ola Electric Technologies, Ola Financial Services, Ola Electric Charging, Ola Fleet, and Ola Stores. Unlike most of its peers, Ola Electric has started manufacturing its own cells. It is worth noting that building cells in India is extremely important for the company because, for every INR 100 spent on an electric scooter, over INR 32 goes towards importing cells and other components.\u00a0 Since March 31, 2024, Ola Cell Technologies has developed the capability to produce 1.4 GWh at the company\u2019s Gigafactory in Krishnanagar, Tamil Nadu, located near the Ola Futurefactory. However, this is not going to reduce the cell prices for Ola Electric. Instead, the company has planned to heavily invest in cell manufacturing for the next three years in a row to meet the targets per year as promised under the PLI scheme to the Indian government. While Bhavish Aggarwal has been monitoring and controlling the Ola brands and hence essentially even micromanages the executive decisions across the brands.\u00a0 Besides Park, sources talk about Vishal Chaturvedi as being another key leader at Ola Cell Technologies. Chaturvedi is the business head at Ola Cell and Park is the expert in battery manufacturing, and therefore the COO of this subsidiary. Besides the duo, associate director Rajkumar K leads the mechanical cell design team for battery structural parts and packs. Under CEO Aggarwal, the Ola Electric Technologies features four executives running the show. We have spoken about Ananthan, Chatterjee and Calvert briefly above. But Samraj Jabez Dhinagar, the head of vehicle engineering is another key pillar.\u00a0 Ananthan, who joined Ola Electric in July 2022, heads the vehicle design unit and the bike concepts unveiled by the company on August 15, 2023 were designed under her purview. A BITS Pilani and IIT Bombay alumni, Ananthan took home INR 1.6 Cr in FY24, while Calvert was paid INR 4.8 Cr in FY24. Given his sweeping role across verticals, Chatterjee is the highest-paid executive in this division and earned INR 5.3 Cr in FY24. All of them except Chatterjee have joined in 2022 or after, which does raise some concerns, but their collective depth of experience is a key strength, and there are many questions about  Aggarwal\u2019s claims from the past .\u00a0 The annual production targets for Gigafactory and Futurefactory have also been lowered in the official RHP in comparison to what was initially promoted before the company had to make disclosures. The company had earlier aimed to produce over 1 Mn cars at the Futurefactory, a plan that has now been shelved entirely.\u00a0 While Giagfactory\u2019s estimated target capacity is now capped at 20 GWh, the 1 Mn production of E4Ws has been fully shelved. The current installed capacity of the Futurefactory stands at 679K, less than 1 Mn, and that\u2019s just for two-wheelers.\u00a0 Bhavish Aggarwal has always been known to set aggressive targets, but now with Ola Electric required to disclose such targets to the regulatory, the company has had to curb some of that enthusiasm.\u00a0 There have also been exits in the top management, which is said to be a key factor in Ola Electric rejigging some of its targets. These include  Slokarth Das , head of planning and strategy, Saurabh Sarda, head of partnership and corporate affairs, and  Shikharr Sood , head of talent acquisition. Despite having a short term success at the bourses soon after listing, Ola Electric is at a crossroads. And as such, its people will be a key success factor for the company. As a public company, Bhavish Aggarwal will need to let go of some of the aggression that we have witnessed in the past.\u00a0 After all, there could be deeper ramifications now than just the ire of a few private shareholders.\u00a0 While its extensive infrastructure, significant investments in technology and R&D, and a moderate valuation successfully attracted a pool of investors, concerns over profitability and basic financial health cannot be ignored.\u00a0 For instance, the company sold 3.26 Lakh two-wheelers in FY24, it also registered a net loss of INR 1,584 Cr, which effectively means a loss of INR 48,500 on every scooter sold, given that Ola does not yet offer services for EV charging to other OEMs.\u00a0 Plus, in the first three months of FY24 i.e April-June 2023, EV subsidies were up to INR 40,000 per scooter sold, which was reduced to INR 15,000 from June 2023 onwards. This has been further reduced to INR 10,000, which many expect will cool down the EV market.\u00a0 One particular calculation by the Morning Context, using the high-low method to calculate the breakeven,  shows  that Ola Electric may have to sell at least 2.24 Mn per year to turn profitable.\u00a0 And this by itself could be enough and more pressure for the key leaders at Ola Electric. For the first few years, these leaders have shown that Ola Electric can pull off aggressive growth. Now with the added responsibility of proposed new products \u2014 three-wheelers and superbikes \u2014 the same team has to show that Ola Electric can grow in a profitable way as well.

        "Article Content": "In another setback to BYJU\u2019S, the embattled edtech major\u2019s second auditor BDO (MSKA & Associates) has resigned amid concerns over \u201cfinancial\u201d and \u201cgovernance\u201d issues. BDO\u2019s exit comes just more than a year after Deloitte, the company\u2019s previous auditor,  stepped down  citing problems with  BYJU\u2019S  financial reporting. The board of BYJU\u2019S initially engaged MSKA & Associates on August 2, 2023, to fill a casual vacancy that had arisen due to Deloitte\u2019s exit. Subsequently, the firm was reappointed on December 20, 2023, as the company\u2019s statutory auditor during the annual general meeting for a duration of five years, spanning from FY23 to FY27.\u00a0 In its resignation letter, BDO highlighted several troubling issues, including delays in financial reporting, lack of support from the management and concerns over recovering outstanding dues from a Dubai-based entity. Specifically, BDO raised doubts about the recovery of approximately INR 1,400 Cr from More Ideas General Trading LLC, a reseller based in Dubai. The transaction was reported to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs on September 2. BDO also pointed to other challenges facing BYJU\u2019S, such as ongoing litigation, liquidation proceedings initiated by creditors, and allegations of mismanagement by minority shareholders. Furthermore, BDO stated that BYJU\u2019S failed to provide crucial information, including notices for extraordinary general meetings (EGMs) and insolvency proceedings, to its audit team. Following resignation, the edtech startup released an official statement saying, \u201cBYJU\u2019S has complied with every request made by BDO, except those that would require crossing ethical and legal boundaries. The real reason for BDO\u2019s resignation is BYJU\u2019S firm refusal to backdate its reports, while BDO went to the extent of recommending a firm that could facilitate such an illegal activity.\u201d \u201cMultiple call recordings exist, where BDO representatives explicitly suggest backdating these documents, which BYJU\u2019S refused to do. BYJU\u2019S strongly believes that this is the main reason for their resignation,\u201d the statement added. This comes amid BYJU\u2019S facing a heap of legal challenges, which include a recent Supreme Court ruling to recommence insolvency proceedings against the startup. BYJU\u2019S entered  insolvency  proceedings on July 16, 2024, due to a legal  dispute  with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). This led to the appointment of an Insolvency Resolution Professional (IRP) and the suspension of the company\u2019s Board.\u00a0 The following day, on July 17, BDO emailed the suspended board requesting clarification on historical transactions with a Middle Eastern partner. In the same email, BDO threatened to resign if the clarifications were not provided within 45 days. BDO eventually resigned after the 45-day window expired, citing the suspended board\u2019s failure to provide the requested clarifications. However, surprisingly, the BDO failed to appreciate that for most of that 45-day period, the IRP was in control of BYJU\u2019S and only the IRP could provide the answers they were seeking.\u00a0 During a Committee of Creditors meeting on September 3, 2024, the IRP reported attempts to contact BDO for clarification but received no response, raising concerns about BDO\u2019s communication practices. Regarding the Middle Eastern transactions, BYJU\u2019S clarified that a forensic audit was arranged and supervised by BDO before the insolvency proceedings. The audit could not be completed due to the insolvency initiation, but a prior audit had cleared these transactions.\u00a0 A BDO senior partner has also confirmed on video that after conducting thorough due diligence, they have found no evidence of fraud or malpractice in our international transactions, the company added in the statement.",

        "Article Content": "Ride-hailing major Uber is bringing back its high-end Uber Black service to India as the company focuses on upgrading its services to cater to the premium segment. This service is expected to be rolled out in the next few weeks, starting with some localities in Mumbai. Uber Black is a service in its high-end black cars, with highly rated and professional chauffeurs. An Uber spokesperson told Inc42, \u201cThere is a critical mass of travellers that are willing to pay a premium for on-demand services that give them high end experience and as Uber caters to a full spectrum of riders with different mobility needs, we are responding to this growing demand.\u201d The development was reported by the Economic Times first. \u201cUber Black will be priced comparatively 30-40% more than its existing high-end service Uber Premier, and the company expects it to have a huge traction with corporate travel use cases,\u201d a source was quoted while saying in the report. In 2013, the company started its India operations with Uber Black, under which high-end cars such as Mercedes, BMW and Audi were available on demand. Back then, Uber replaced these luxury cars with models such as Toyota Innova, Honda City and Toyota Corolla, which was later stalled the following year due to limited purchasing power of consumers. To blend with the consumers\u2019 preferences, in 2014, Uber  launched  its low cost cab booking service UberGo in India, with its base fare starting at INR 40, further priced at INR 12/Km (Delhi) and increasing by INR 1 per minute.\u00a0 UberGo has a new range of hatchbacks as part of its fleet, comprising Tata Indica Vista, Nissan Micra and Maruti Suzuki Swift. With the persistently high inflation spiking the price bands of groceries to grooming, consumers have now become well-adjusted to higher spending and are open to adapting the style of luxury services. The revamped version of Uber Black and Uber Black SUV will be a far more sustainable model where customers will be provided with a white glove cab service in bigger cars than currently available commercial sedans, one of the sources was quoted as saying in the report. The source also said that the sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and multi-utility vehicles (MUVs) of Toyota, MG and others will be part of the Uber Black service. The ride-hailing giant\u2019s chief executive officer Dara Khosrowshahi earlier this year said that India has been one of the  toughest markets  to crack. Ola\u2019s competitor in India has been on trend to meet its consumers\u2019 demand. For instance, the company launched UberGo, when it saw the pinch in consumer spending, and the rising interests on public transport led to bringing in Uber  shuttle  rides. The recent introduction being Uber Green with the mounting likes over electric vehicles, in November 2023. Updated at 11:43 AM",

        "Article Content": "A 26-year old man was arrested for allegedly setting an Ola Electric\u2019s showroom on fire in Karnataka\u2019s Kalaburagi area over \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d servicing of his newly purchased electric scooter. The incident took place yesterday (September 10), raising concerns about the quality of service at Ola Electric. According to Ola\u2019s website, it operates a total of 431 service stations across India. As per media reports, Mohammad Nadeem, a mechanic by profession, bought the two-wheeler last month, a few days after which he brought it back for servicing on facing trouble with the scooter, Reuters reported, citing Kalaburagi\u2019s police commissioner. \u201cThe (servicing) response was not good, he went multiple times. Yesterday (Tuesday), when he went, he carried petrol and set fire to six bikes,\u201d he said. The fire caused damage estimated at INR 850,000, though no injuries were reported. The cause of the fire was earlier suspected to be a short circuit. However, after Nadeem\u2019s role in the arson came to light, he was taken into custody for interrogation. A complaint has been registered against him. Responding to the incident, Ola said in an X post, \u201c The perpetrator of this violent act has been identified and an FIR has been lodged against the individual. He has been arrested and an investigation is ongoing.\u201d The latest development comes two weeks after it was reported that a fire broke out at an Ola showroom in Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Indore city. However, there were no casualties and the showroom was fully evacuated. This also comes at a time when the Bhavish Aggarwal-led company is  gearing up to enter the electric three-wheeler (3W) market  to take on the likes of Euler Motors, Piaggio, Mahindra Electric, among others. Ola Electric  is developing an in-house electric three-wheeler and plans \u201cto bring it to the market soon\u201d, CEO and managing director Aggarwal told CNBC-TV18. However, he did not provide a specific timeline for the launch. It is pertinent to note that Ola Electric\u2019s  consolidated net loss widened 30% to INR 347 Cr  in the June quarter of the financial year 2024-25 (Q1 FY25) from INR 267 Cr in the year-ago quarter. With its EV 3W bet, the company will look to chart a course to profitability.\u00a0 This also comes close on the heels of  Centre looking to accelerate EV penetration in the country. Recently, union minister for heavy industries H D Kumaraswamy said that the  Centre will roll out the third edition of its demand incentive scheme for EVs, FAME-III  in the next two months. Shares of Ola Electric ended today\u2019s trading session marginally higher at INR 115.60 apiece on the BSE. (Note: The story has been updated with Ola\u2019s response)",

        "Article Content": "HSBC said that the recent market share loss at  Ola Electric  is worrisome as the brokerage firm sees a 15-20% downside risk to its FY25/26 volume projections for the company if the current market share trend continues.\u00a0 This comes days after the recently listed Ola Electric\u2019s total escooter registrations  slumped 34% month-on-month (MoM) to 27,517 units  in August. Its vehicle registrations stood at 41,712 units in July and 36,832 units in June. \u201cRecent market share loss could be due to the ramp-up of low cost variants from competition,\u201d HSBC said. On the other hand, TVS\u2019 market share in the electric-two wheeler market has surged from 15% to 19% over the same period while Bajaj\u2019s has jumped from 11% to 18%. TVS Motor has been witnessing sustained growth in recent months, with new registrations for its EVs  jumping 39% month-on-month to 19,471 units  in July. Despite the recent sales dip, HSBC remains optimistic about Ola Electric\u2019s recovery and has maintained its \u2018buy\u2019 rating on the stock. The firm has set a price target of INR 140, which suggests a 24% potential upside from the previous close. Since its stock market debut last month, Ola Electric\u2019s shares have experienced significant volatility, with periods of both gains and declines. In September, shares of Bhavish Aggarwal-led Ola Electric plunged as much as 4% to INR 105.10 apiece during the intraday trading session on the BSE. On August 9, Ola Electric Mobility\u2019s  shares made a flat debut on the bourses  as the stock got listed at INR 75.99 on the BSE, same as the issue price. At 11:10 AM, shares of Ola Electric were trading at INR 112.30, a decline of 0.62% from the previous close of INR 113.",

        "Article Content": "The Delhi High Court (HC) has asked ride-hailing unicorn  Rapido  to submit a compliance report on the accessibility of its app for persons with disability (PwD). The HC has directed the company to also submit an audit report from an \u201caccess auditor\u201d empanelled with the department of empowerment of PwD under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment by November 28.\u00a0 The order was given by Judge Sanjeev Narula while hearing a writ petition filed by accessibility activist Amar Jain and visually impaired banker Dipto Ghosh Choudhary against Rapdio, raising concerns on accessibility of Rapido\u2019s app for PwD.\u00a0 The petitioners said that the Rapido app fails to cater to the needs of disabled individuals. They also highlighted certain features of the app that fall short in terms of compatibility with softwares which increase accessibility, such as screen reading softwares, thus rendering the app \u201csignificantly unusable\u201d by PwD.\u00a0 Responding to the petition, Rapido acknowledged the accessibility issues and said it would update its app within 6-8 months to comply with accessibility standards under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. Further, the startup said that it would introduce a training programme for its captains and staff to ensure they can provide supportive and accommodating service to PwD. It will also look to develop a feedback mechanism to acknowledge and address the concerns of PwD.\u00a0 \u201cThis initiative includes training on sensitivity, awareness, and the specific needs of persons with disabilities, as mandated under Section 47 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act),\u201d the startup said.\u00a0 Following this, the HC asked Rapido to submit the compliance report. In a post on LinkedIn, Jain, who heads non-profit organisation \u2018Mission Accessibility\u2019, said that the order will help address the gaps in accessibility for PwD while availing ride-hailing services.\u00a0 \u201cWe trust that this continued legal intervention would help us plug the gaps of disability inclusion in aggregator based transportation in the country and Rapido would become another good example in this space just like Namma Yatri,\u201d he said.\u00a0 The development came almost a month after  Rapido entered the coveted unicorn club  after raising $120 Mn (about INR 1,000 Cr) from existing investor WestBridge Capital. Founded in 2015 by Rishikesh SR, Pavan Guntupalli, and Aravind Sanka, the startup\u00a0 primarily operates in the bike taxi and auto transportation segments. In December last year, it also launched cab services in some cities. In addition, it also offers peer-to-peer delivery services via Rapido Local.\u00a0 Rapido counts the likes of Swiggy, TVS Motor, Nexus Venture Partners, and Shell Ventures among its investors. On the financial front,  Rapido\u2019s net loss widened over 50% to INR 674.5 Cr  in the financial year 2022-23 (FY23) from INR 439 Cr in the previous fiscal year. Operating revenue zoomed to INR 443 Cr from INR 144.8 Cr in FY22.",

        "Article Content": "Rapido  has raised $200 Mn (INR 1,660 Cr) in a Series E funding round led by existing investor WestBridge Capital that catapulted the ride-hailing startup into the unicorn club with a valuation of $1.1 Bn. The round also saw participation from existing backer Nexus Venture Partners, along with new investors Think Investments and New York-based Invus Opportunities. Aravind Sanka, cofounder of Rapido, said in a statement that the proceeds would be deployed to expand the company\u2019s recently launched four-wheeler taxi service. Additionally, the investment will support the expansion of Rapido\u2019s operations across India and the scaling of its technology platform to improve service delivery. \u201cThe latest fundraise comes on the back of strong growth we have clocked over the last two years,\u201d he added. In July, Inc42 reported that Rapido secured  $120 Mn (approximately INR 1,000 Cr)  from existing investor WestBridge Capital.\u00a0 Rapido is currently clocking 2.3-2.5 Mn orders daily across different form factors, with 7% coming from business-to-business (B2B) operations. Under B2B, the company fulfils food-delivery orders for Swiggy during lean hours for bike-taxi services and has also onboarded the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) as a logistics provider, said the cofounder.

        "Article Content": "Road accidents remain a global scourge, claiming countless lives annually and inflicting a devastating impact on economies worldwide. The fight against road accidents transcends boundaries as governments around the world echo the same question: How can we reduce them? In 2020, the UN proclaimed the \u2018 Decade of Action for Road Safety ,\u2019 targeting a 50% reduction in road traffic deaths and injuries by 2030. In India, the scenario mirrors this global effort, with Nitin Gadkari, the Minister of Road Transport and Highways, emphasising on road safety and aiming to cut accident deaths by half by 2030. In the backdrop of this, it may sound uncommon for two techies in the U.S. to dedicate themselves to improving global road safety. But despite the lack of precedence, Stanford alumni and former Qualcomm colleagues Avneesh Agrawal and David Julian embarked on this mission. They incorporated  NetraDyne  Technology in 2015 to build tech that analyses driving behaviour in real-time and reduce driver errors and the risk of accidents through automated coaching. Its vision-based Driver\u2022i safety camera system uses cutting-edge technologies powered by Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Edge Computing to create a new safe driving standard for commercial vehicles. With inward and outward high-definition cameras on the same IoT device, Driver\u2022i empowers drivers by providing awareness of risky driving behaviour and rewarding safe driving practices. It analyses 100% of driving time, detecting any driving behaviour that could lead to an accident. This includes over-speeding, driver drowsiness and fatigue, distracted driving, and tailgating, among others, and coaches drivers in real-time. In addition, to incentivise safe driving, the device recognises positive behaviours and rewards drivers with \u201cdriver stars\u201d \u2014 a gamification element that builds a positive driver profile. Netradyne is a global company with operations in India, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand and Germany.\u00a0 \u201cWhen we started out in 2015, there was no established provider who could combine AI with video telematics to create a solution that could detect, reason, and determine the causality of events. Netradyne stepped in to fill this gap,\u201d said Agrawal. Netradyne has pooled over 13 Bn miles of proprietary driving data to develop its state-of-the-art analytics models. This massive dataset is the secret sauce behind its machine learning algorithms, which boast a decision accuracy of up to 99%, according to Julian. More importantly, Netradyne has built its AI system from scratch using this unique data. \u201cDeep tech and innovation are part of Netradyne\u2019s DNA,\u201d Agrawal continued, noting that both founders have over 300 patents combined. According to NASSCOM\u2019s  \u2018Patenting Trends in India Edition 2024 ,\u2019 Netradyne is one of the top patent filers among deeptech startups in India. However, building a tech startup from the ground up was not easy, and the founders faced their fair share of challenges along the way. With a global vision from the outset, Agrawal and Julian constantly connected across different continents and time zones, working tirelessly to solidify their concept. They invested their own capital, rented office space in both India, where Agrawal worked, and the U.S., where Julian worked, and began building their team \u2013 most of whom are still with Netradyne today. Many of the early employees, including office staff, have stayed with Netradyne over the years and have risen to leadership positions. The startup has inculcated a philosophy of innovation, resilience and a dynamic approach since the beginning, which the founders believe also trickles down to employee values. A good example of this philosophy is how the small team turned adversity into an opportunity during the development of their dataset. The founders quickly realised they needed custom hardware to truly address driver safety. Building their own would take another year or two, Julian explained. So, they got resourceful. They purchased a set-top box with an NVIDIA processor and used it to run deep learning algorithms in real-time. \u201cWe even got a mobile phone and mounted it on the windshield for LTE connectivity, outward and inward cameras, and accelerometer/gyro sensors,\u201d Julian added. (LTE stands for Long-Term Evolution, a standard that improves internet speed for mobile devices). \u201cTo get everything working, our cloud team set up the cloud infrastructure. This allowed us to use a mobile phone for the camera. Since I have a background in deep learning and wireless communication, we sent the data to the GPU on the set-top box for processing and video storage over WI-FI. Finally, WIFI was used to send the processed data back to the mobile phone and then over LTE back to the cloud,\u201d said Julian. This strategic approach proved successful. It validated the concept and gave the founders the confidence to scale up. With a functional prototype, the founders initiated demos for potential customers and investors, receiving positive feedback. Today, the platform runs a full-fledged cloud repository for data storage, real-time tracking, driver evaluation, and training. The founders believe this system can significantly benefit driver exoneration in cases where the driver is not at fault. Since the camera captures both the driver\u2019s actions and the vehicle\u2019s movement on the road, it provides irrefutable proof in situations where the driver may be unfairly blamed. \u201cCommercial vehicles tend to be blamed for road accidents. However, more often than not, they are not at fault. This solution addresses that challenge and provides proof,\u201d said Julian. Netradyne claims that Driver\u2022i has assessed over 13 Bn miles of driving data (driver behaviour, road and traffic patterns) and is clocking more than  600 Mn miles of data  every month globally. Given that the size of data defines the success of any AI system, the availability of such rich data makes Netradyne\u2019s AI highly accurate and precise. The founders emphasised that this is crucial to minimising the number of false alerts for drivers, ultimately gaining their confidence in the technology. Today, Netradyne maintains a customer base exceeding 3,000 globally, including prominent entities such as  IndianOil Skytanking ,  GreenLine Mobility,   Writer Safeguard ,  CJ Darcl ,  First Student  and  Loomis . This extensive network not only solidifies Netradyne\u2019s global footprint but also reinforces its pivotal role in tackling the critical challenge of road safety on a monumental scale. And much like its SaaS peers, Netradyne charges a monthly subscription for its solution, which includes both hardware and software. Speaking to Inc42, the founders reported revenue of INR 1,000 Cr ARR as of December 2023 and anticipate a 50% year-on-year growth in the current calendar year. The company has raised $227 Mn across three funding rounds from investors such as Reliance, M12, SoftBank Vision Fund, and Point72 Venture Investments. These funds are being used to drive R&D, enhance core technology, and enter new markets.\u00a0 Netradyne is aiming to revolutionise the world of vehicle safety technology by harnessing the power of in-house talent and cutting-edge technological expertise. With sophisticated test labs in India and the U.S., its hardware design and software development teams collaborate seamlessly across borders, with Bengaluru serving as the hub for innovation. CEO Agrawal recognises the importance of tapping into the best talent worldwide.  \u201cAI talent is very strong in the U.S., but we are also seeing a rapidly growing crop of tech talent in India,\u201d Agrawal explains. This approach allows Netradyne to assemble a diverse team capable of tackling complex challenges. \u201cAn illustrative example of our system\u2019s impact is a case where a driver\u2019s low GreenZone score prompted their spouse to intervene. The spouse\u2019s insistence on safety improvement led to the driver becoming the fleet\u2019s top performer within a month! This highlights the positive influence families can have in encouraging safe driving habits, especially in a profession fraught with danger,\u201d said Agrawal, For context, Netradyne\u2019s GreenZone is a driver scoring system that assesses individual driving habits and associated behaviour. It is a data-driven approach that provides a quantifiable score by analysing every second of driving. To enable this, the system utilises computer-vision technologies and AI cameras with inbuilt sensors, gyrometer and accelerometers to collect data on driving habits. According to Mordor Intelligence, the global market size for video telematics device installations is projected to surge from 8.3 Mn units in 2024 to 18.8 Mn by 2029, exhibiting a  robust CAGR of 17.9%  during this period.\u00a0 Moreover, the demand for AI-enabled video analytics is steadily escalating, driven by its myriad benefits such as accident prevention, enhanced driver engagement, instantaneous incident notification, and diminished operational costs. With human error still a major culprit in road accidents,  accounting for nearly 94%  according to a ResearchGate report, companies like Netradyne offer a crucial solution. By providing real-time feedback, they empower drivers with vital insights beyond their field of view. This real-time coaching fosters better decision-making and a heightened sense of awareness, ultimately leading to safer roads and fewer accidents. While the penetration of video telematics in trucks stands at around 10-15% in the U.S. and notably lower in India, Agrawal and Julian remain bullish about its rapid uptake in both of these countries as well as other geographies. The founders have already seen a shift, observing that major fleet owners grasp the paramount importance of road and driver safety, and are thus receptive to embracing Netradyne\u2019s solutions. Having made significant strides in preempting road accidents, it now sets its sights on entering the \u2018prediction\u2019 phase to anticipate potential incidents based on the large set of data that analyses the entire road ecosystem on the edge. To this end, it will leverage a foundational driving model utilising large language models (LLMs) based on its proprietary dataset. Nonetheless, the market presents its share of challenges. Netradyne contends with competition from established players like Lytx and Samsara in California, alongside few India-based providers.  However, the founders believe that their innovation: Highly precise and accurate AI algorithms and in-house end-to-end product capabilities set them apart.\u00a0 As a startup navigating the convergence of AI-enabled technological disruptions and an expansive market opportunity, Netradyne finds itself positioned at a critical juncture. While the widespread adoption of self-driving vehicles remains years away, the video telematics landscape is poised to flourish, offering a secure passage for human drivers in the interim.",

        "Article Content": "Bhavish Aggarwal-led  Ola Electric  is gearing up to enter the electric three-wheeler (3W) market to take on the likes of Euler Motors, Piaggio, Mahindra Electric, among others. Ola Electric is developing an in-house electric three-wheeler and plans \u201cto bring it to the market soon\u201d, CEO and managing director Aggarwal told CNBC-TV18. However, he did not provide a specific timeline for the launch. Aggarwal said that erickshwas have been on the company\u2019s radar since its inception and it has also demonstrated technology focussed on the product. Ola Electric\u2019s planned foray into the EV 3W segment has been influenced by the company\u2019s interaction with driver partners on the Ola Cabs platform on themes such as the challenges facing them and their propensity towards electric vehicles. As per a separate report by The Economic Times, Ola Electric might unveil its 3W EV, presumably named \u2018Raahi\u2019, within the next 3-4 months. Ola Electric\u2019s forthcoming EV 3W Raahi reportedly has a minimalist design with the vehicle\u2019s front profile equipped with square headlights, a large windshield, A-pillar mounted outside rear view mirrors (OVRMs) and doors to ensure cabin safety. Apart from the passenger version, Ola Electric is also expected to launch a goods carrier variant of its 3W EV to cater to its diverse clientele, as per the report. Ola Electric\u2019s entry into the Indian electric 3W market will directly pit it against incumbents such as Mahindra, Bajaj and Piaggio, among others, who currently offer their products in the range of INR 2 Lakh to INR 3.5 Lakh. Ola Electric could price its upcoming EV 3W below the industry\u2019s upper price range, mimicking the pricing undercut approach it has taken with its  Roadster series of ebikes  to lure customers. As per Vahan data, sales of electric 3Ws surged 66% year-on-year to 5.8 Lakh units in 2023. Moreover, electric 3Ws made up 50% of overall three-wheeler sales that year. It is pertinent to note that Ola Electric\u2019s  consolidated net loss widened 30% to INR 347 Cr  in the June quarter of the financial year 2024-25 (Q1 FY25) from INR 267 Cr in the year-ago quarter. With its EV 3W bet, the company will look to chart a course to profitability.\u00a0 During the interaction with CNBC-TV18, Aggarwal said Ola Electric\u2019s EV business is close to breaking even on an EBITDA level.\u00a0 This comes at a time when the Centre is looking to accelerate EV penetration in the country. Recently, union minister for heavy industries H. D. Kumaraswamy said that the  Centre will roll out the third edition of its demand incentive scheme for EVs, FAME-III  in the next two months. Shares of Ola Electric ended Thursday\u2019s trading session 4% higher at INR 115.25 apiece on the BSE. \u00a0 \u00a0",

        "Author Name": "Gargi Sarkar",
        "Author URL": "https://inc42.com/author/gargi-sarkar/",
        "Article Content": "Driven by an ever-expanding fleet of new brands, the Indian frozen food industry has undergone a complete metamorphosis in recent years. However, the expansion of this segment, fuelled by a range of factors, including the pandemic, a surge in global culinary trends, and increased urbanisation, has not been easy. Topping the list of challenges for companies in this line of work are the substantial capital investments needed to establish and maintain freezing facilities, storage infrastructure, and distribution networks. Moreover, despite improvements in the cold chain infrastructure, significant gaps remain, posing ongoing challenges in ensuring the consistent quality and safety of frozen products throughout the supply chain. Amid this, Mira Jhala, a third-time entrepreneur, is hell-bent on solving the cold storage supply chain challenges for frozen foods with her B2B supply chain startup,  FroGo . Founded in March 2022, FroGo provides tailored fulfilment infrastructure for ice cream and frozen food brands, allowing them to start online operations in a few days. Notably, Jhala comes with a ton of experience in the food industry. Before moving back to India in 2009, she worked in the US for several years. Her previous startup in the food services space was acquired by Curefit, and she wanted her next venture to remain within the food industry but address an underserved market. \u201cOver the years, I have observed the growth of the frozen food sector, noticing a significant increase in exposure from 2009 to the present. I have also identified gaps throughout the entire supply chain. The rapid growth of this category is evident, with the domestic retail market valued at INR 50,000 Cr and expanding at a 17% CAGR. The strong demand and growth potential in this sector make it an attractive opportunity for addressing the current market needs,\u201d Jhala said. Speaking with Inc42, Jhala shared that her goal with FroGo is to streamline how food brands connect with consumers by leveraging its network of dark stores, which also forms the core of FroGo\u2019s operations. These dark stores hold the inventory, process orders, and handle deliveries, allowing brands to serve customers swiftly. Currently, Frogo operates over 50 dark stores in Delhi, Noida, Faridabad, Chandigarh, Panchkula, and Mohali. Per Jhala, the company is rapidly expanding its reach by adding two new dark stores each week to keep pace with the growing demand. Further, the startup simplifies how food brands deliver their products to consumers through a network of dark stores and third-party warehouses. It also enjoys its partnerships with three external warehouse companies to manage the storage of products for various brands. FroGo also takes care of logistics, ensuring that products are efficiently moved from these warehouses to its dark stores. Jhala told Inc42 that while the market includes quick commerce players offering 10-minute delivery and large platforms like Amazon with 1 to 3-day delivery, FroGo occupies a unique niche between these two extremes. \u201cWe focus on providing 30 to 90-minute deliveries, offering a middle ground where brands can maintain control over their demand while achieving fast delivery times,\u201d the founder said. Besides fast delivery, brands that partner with FroGo can showcase their full product catalogue and manage demand themselves, rather than depending on the platforms where they may have limited SKUs. Hence, this provides a parallel channel to both quick commerce and traditional ecommerce, catering to specific needs without overlapping with existing solutions. Currently, FroGo operates on a revenue-sharing model with the brands that use its dark store network. The startup claims to be working with 70+ FMGC and D2C brands. However, the founder denied to share FY24 numbers. By the end of FY25, FroGo aims to work with around 150 brands, expanding beyond just frozen foods to include a broader range of food products. \u201cCustomer acquisition has not been a challenge for us. As a B2B company, our clients are food brands, and we already work with over 70 of them. Word spreads quickly in our industry, and we even have a waiting list of 22 brands eager to onboard,\u201d Jhala said. In addition, FroGo\u2019s annual gross merchandise value (GMV) stands at approximately INR 18 Cr. As it is expanding its dark store network, it is targeting a 5X increase in GMV in FY25. The startup is also focussed on adding two dark stores every week in North India and has plans to expand into southern cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai soon. \u201cThis expansion will impact our expenses, but we have structured our business model to ensure that we achieve contribution margin positivity in each city within six months. This approach allows us to grow quickly but sustainably,\u201d Jhala added. According to a market study, the India Supply Chain Management (SCM) market, valued at $3.42 Bn in 2023, is set to grow at a CAGR of 11.1%, reaching $6.43 Bn by 2030. \nOn a different note, FroGo\u2019s competitors like JustDeliveries and Indicold have recently grabbed a lot of investor interest. In March,  JustDeliveries secured $1 Mn  in a funding round led by NABVENTURES Fund, with participation from FAAD Network, Anay Ventures, Caret Capital and the Mahansaria family office. With the capital, the cold chain solutions startup plans to deepen its logistics networks across key cities, including Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune, and NCR, and launch operations in Hyderabad. Similarly, supply chain startup  Indicold received raised funds from Fundalogical Ventures  and Everstone Group to expand its footprint. With this kind of investor interest and growth in the segment, the entry of more players is inevitable. For now, to secure its market position from existing players and new entrants, FroGo may have to be on its toes until it becomes a go-to name in the industry. [Edited By Shishir Parasher]",

        "Article Content": "After a gap of almost 10 years, ride hailing major Uber has announced the relaunch of its high-end Uber Black service in India, starting with Mumbai next week. Last month, Inc42 reported that Uber  would be bringing back its Uber Black service  to India as the company focuses on upgrading its services to cater to the premium segment.

The company also said that the premium cab offers extended wait times, providing riders a benefit of an additional 5-minute pickup window without incurring a waiting fee, offering greater flexibility. Prabhjeet Singh, president at Uber India and South Asia said, \u201cAs the largest on-demand mobility network with industry-leading matching, routing, and pricing tech and scaled fleet operations \u2013 we are bringing the magic of consistent high quality service and premium comfort with Black.\u201d Uber has introduced various kinds of vehicle options to stay ahead of its competitors to remain the most preferred option for booking rides. The recent introduction being Uber Green with the mounting likes over electric vehicles, in November 2023. Aside from that, the company has also rolled out its  shuttle  services in the national capital, looking at the potential of public transport in the metro cities. With the inflation and geopolitical tensions on peak, the price bands of groceries to fuel are stubbornly high. Consumers have now begun to adapt to spending more from their pockets, and are open to experiencing luxury services, providing room for premium brands to flourish. \u201cAs India\u2019s leading multimodal mobility service, Uber endeavors to cater to the full spectrum of riders, from those seeking affordable rides on two or three wheels to those who desire a truly well-appointed experience in premium vehicles,\u201d Singh added.",

Bird Eats Bug offers a SaaS platform that claims to help enterprises debug their codes up to 30% faster on average. With this acquisition, BrowserStack will leverage Bird Eats Bug\u2019s tech stack to streamline bug reporting processes and eliminate fragmented toolchains in testing.\u00a0 As part of the deal, Bird Eats Bug has now been rebranded as \u201cBug Capture by BrowserStack\u201d. \u201cBy integrating Bug Capture\u2019s approach to bug reporting into our platform, we\u2019re boosting development teams\u2019 productivity so they can focus more on building great products and less on managing the intricacies of the testing process,\u201d said BrowserStack cofounder and CEO Ritesh Arora. Commenting on the acquisition, Bird Eats Bug cofounder and CEO Dan Makarov said, \u201cWe\u2019re truly excited about our joint future with BrowserStack\u2026 It\u2019s hard to think of two products that would be a better fit. My cofounder, Jacky Chung, and I have been highly impressed by the quality of the team and their ambitious vision for Bird\u201d. Founded in 2020, Bird Eats Bug claims to have more than 30,000 users under its belt and last raised $1.65 Mn in seed funding round led by Nauta Capital in 2021. The Berlin-based company is BrowserStack\u2019s fifth acquisition since 2020. The Ritesh Arora-led company previously acquired SaaS platforms Percy, AutomatePro, Nightwatch.js, and Quail. Founded in 2011 by Arora and Nakul Aggarwal, BrowserStack offers a platform for software testing across various devices and browsers. The company claims to be profitable since its inception and has more than 15 products in its portfolio, 10 of which have been launched in the past 18 months. BrowserStack last raised $200 Mn in a round led by US-based investment firm BOND in 2021, The funding round valued the company at $4 Bn.\u00a0 Notwithstanding this, the acquisition comes at a time when BrowserStack is embroiled in legal challenges. In April this year,  Deque Systems sued  BrowserStack in a US court alleging intellectual property theft. BrowserStack\u2019s Indian entity saw its standalone net profit jump 52% to INR 114 Cr in the financial year 2022-23 (FY23) from INR 75 Cr in the previous fiscal year. Operating revenue jumped 46% year-on-year (YoY) to INR 612 Cr in the fiscal year ended March 2023.",

He has played a key role in developing Darwinbox\u2019s HR tech platform into a full-fledged Human Capital Management (HCM) suite with 15 modules. \u201cVineet has been pivotal in realising Darwinbox\u2019s vision to build a global-standard enterprise tech product from India,\u201d said Chaitanya Peddi, co-founder of Darwinbox. \u201cHe has successfully scaled our engineering and R&D teams and has played an active role in areas beyond technology to positively impact Darwinbox\u2019s growth.\u201d Darwinbox reported a near  doubling of its operating revenue  to INR 224.04 Cr in FY23, up from INR 116.73 Cr in FY22. However, the company\u2019s net loss increased to INR 158.25 Cr due to higher expenses, including employee costs and cloud hosting expenses. Singh said, \u201cAs I step into the role of co-founder, we will further accelerate our technological innovations, embedding AI as a platform capability to deliver better experience and contextual intelligence to our customers.\u201d Darwinbox currently serves over 900 customers across more than 130 countries, with clients including Adani, MatchMove, and Mahindra.

        "Article Content": "Community and security management startup  myGate  has ventured into the consumer devices market with the launch of a range of digital smart lock doors. Mygate Locks will enable users to manage access to their homes remotely via its app. The lock will also facilitate remote unlocking via OTP, end-to-end data encryption, easy user management and real-time notifications, the company said in a statement. The product is launched in three variants \u2013Lock SE, Lock Plus and Lock Pro.\u00a0 This comes on the back of the Bengaluru-based startup looking to expand into the smart home appliances segment. \u201cMygate Locks is the very beginning of this journey and delivers a smart security solution that is both revolutionary and user-friendly, making it an ideal choice for every home,\u201d said Mygate\u2019s cofounder and chief technology officer Shreyans Daga. Founded by Daga,  Vijay Arisetty and Abhishek Kumar in 2016, Mygate offers security solutions for  apartment complexes at entry and exit gates. The company also claims to be a replacement for  other security-related systems such as RFID cards, biometrics and vehicle stickers. Mygate  posted  a 35.3% rise in operating revenue to INR 96.2 Cr in the financial year 2023-24 (FY24) from INR 71.1 Cr in the previous fiscal, helped by growth in its key revenue streams of advertising and software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscriptions.\u00a0 The startup earned INR 85.4 Cr as enterprise revenue, which increased 35.1% year-on-year (YoY), as per the startup\u2019s business summary. This includes income from enterprise sources, including resident welfare associations, security agencies, and builders. On the other hand, revenue from consumer services, which includes utility bill payments, maintenance bills, and home services, also grew almost 38% YoY to INR 10.9 Cr in FY24. Mygate said its total revenue stood at INR 109.1 Cr in FY24, an increase of 41% from INR 77.2 Cr the previous year. Meanwhile, the startup claimed to have reduced its cash burn by 85% during FY24, with zero cash burn recorded in the March quarter (Q4). \u00a0",

The company\u2019s new offering allows businesses to receive payments through various methods, including UPI, net banking and cards. According to the company, by integrating Zoho Payments with the company\u2019s existing finance and operations applications, including Zoho Books, Zoho Invoice and Zoho Billing, businesses can streamline their payment processes and boost overall efficiency. The B2B payments capabilities of Zoho Payments are powered by Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) of NPCI Bharat BillPay Limited (NBBL). Zoho  obtained a payment aggregator licence  from RBI in February.\u00a0 \u201cAt Zoho, we strongly believe that business finance, banking, and payments should work together,\u201d Sivaramakrishnan Iswaran, Global Head of Finance and Operations BU, Zoho, said in a statement.\u00a0 \u201cTowards this vision, we had launched our \u2018Connected Banking\u2019 solution across our finance apps, integrating with leading banks. With the launch of Zoho Payments today, along with B2B payment capabilities, we are able to achieve our goal.\u201d \u201cNBBL\u2019s BBPS standardises invoice presentment and payments, providing multiple payment modes, instant payment confirmations, invoice financing, and a unified platform for invoice transmission and reconciliation. This marks a major advancement in the fintech domain. As a result, we can now offer a more holistic financial management solution for businesses,\u201d Iswaran added. This comes almost six months after Zoho launched its new business division  Zakya to offer POS solutions  to its retail business in February.\u00a0 Zakya offers improved inventory management, omnichannel sales, and customer experience, and can be implemented in under an hour for businesses with thousands of items in their inventory, Meanwhile, Zoho has maintained the diversification of its offerings for quite some time now.\u00a0 The Chennai-based SaaS unicorn last year l aunched Zoho Practice , a free end-to-end practice management solution tailored for chartered accountants (CAs), to increase their productivity and operational efficiency.\u00a0 Earlier in the same year, it launched a privacy-centred browser \u2018Ulaa\u2019 to secure personal data with pre-built capabilities to universally block tracking and website surveillance.\u00a0 Founded in 1996 by Padma Shri awardee Sridhar Vembu, Tony Thomas, Zoho was initially known as AdventNet INC. It has offices in the US, Singapore, the UAE, and Japan.\u00a0 The company offers more than 50 integrated online applications that support multiple business operations spanning sales and marketing, finance, email and collaboration, app creation and analytics, among others. It earns its revenue by selling its software and charging subscription fees to its customers across six continents. On the financial front, the company\u2019s sales  crossed the $1 Bn mark  in the financial year ended March 31, 2023.\u00a0 The bootstrapped unicorn reported an operating revenue of INR 8,703.6 Cr ($1 Bn) in the financial year 2022-23 (FY23), a jump of 30% from INR 6,710.7 Cr in FY22. North America continued to be the biggest contributor to Zoho\u2019s revenue.\u00a0 However, the startup\u2019s total expenditure also zoomed at INR 5,392.7 Cr during the year under review, an increase of 51% from INR 3,571.7 Cr in the previous fiscal year.

        "Article Content": "Conducting its third restructuring exercise in about 16 months, virtual event startup  Airmeet  laid off around 80% of its tech team last month, sources told Inc42. The Prosus-backed startup also fired some employees from its product and design teams as part of the restructuring exercise. Overall, around 30 employees, or 20% of Airmeet\u2019s workforce, were laid off, the sources added. The layoffs were a part of a cost-cutting exercise as the startup has continued to struggle to increase its revenue in the post-pandemic world, one of the sources said,   adding that the number of employees impacted by the latest restructuring could be higher. Airmeet cofounder and CTO Vinay Kumar Jasti held one-on-one conversations with the impacted employees to inform them about the layoffs.\u00a0 The impacted employees will receive a severance package based on their notice periods. Confirming the layoffs, Airmeet cofounder and CEO Lalit Mangal told Inc42, \u201cWe have right sized the team to focus on investing in better and more AI-powered features.\u201d\u00a0 Founded in 2019 by \u200b\u200bMangal, Jasti, and Manoj Kumar Singh, Airmeet is an online meeting and event hosting platform. It also allows participants to connect with other attendees for one-to-one and one-to-many online interactions.\u00a0 The startup saw a surge in demand during the Covid-19 pandemic amid the stay-at-home mandates. This also resulted in a lot of investor interest in the startup. However, as the world opened up after the pandemic and virtual events started seeing a sharp decline, Airmeet struggled to increase its revenue.\u00a0 Now, the startup seems to have decided to focus on new products. \u201cWe are already working on our second product which will be launched soon. Our outlook is to build an R&D function which is largely in-person, based in Bengaluru and wired with the latest AI-powered tools,\u201d Mangal said. \n \n While he didn\u2019t give details about the new product, the CEO said that it will not be focussed on the events space. This is in line with what the aforementioned sources told Inc42. They said that the startup has decided not to upgrade the existing event management product, which led to the decision to let the entire engineering team go.\u00a0 The fresh round of layoffs came almost five months after Inc42 reported that the startup laid off around  20% of its workforce to cut costs . Prior to that, the  startup fired around 30%  of its 250-300 people workforce, or at least 75 employees, in May 2023. Overall, Airmeet has sacked over 100 employees in the last 16 months.\u00a0 Airmeet has raised a total funding of about $50 Mn till date and counts the likes of Accel, Peak XV Partners, Sistema Asia Fund, DG Daiwa Ventures, and Nexxus Global among its backers. On its website, the startup claims to have worked with over 4,000 organisations, including Ford, Unilever, PwC, Capgemini, among others.",

With the fresh allotment, the paid-up share capital of Tracxn has increased to INR 10.47 Cr from INR 10.45 Cr earlier.

        "Article Content": "InMobi-owned Roposo is in the process of moving to a social commerce model and broadening its focus on short videos beyond the creator economy.\u00a0 In its new avatar, Roposo will look to replicate the social commerce model popularised by Meesho before the latter pivoted to a marketplace model.\u00a0 Currently in a transitional phase, Roposo has stopped new user signups and existing users cannot edit or post content, even though the Roposo app and website are still functional.\u00a0 Mansi Jain, senior vice president and general manager of Roposo, told Inc42 that the platform is pivoting from a creator or influencer-led commerce model to social commerce where anyone can sell or resell products within their circle of influence.\u00a0 This is essentially the pitch used by Meesho and Limeroad before at least Meesho moved to a marketplace model in 2022. Jain indicated that Roposo would allow users to set up their own stores and use the platform to extend reach. She also claimed product development for the new model is in advanced stages and it will be launched as early as November.\u00a0 \u201cRoposo in its current form was purely driven by influencer and brand collaborations, where the users could consume content and shop directly from the app, while the order fulfilment was being done by us. However, we are now making it more interactive with users using GenAI tools to sell products online,\u201d Jain told Inc42. Jain added that the full potential of AI in commerce hasn\u2019t been leveraged yet and  InMobi  is looking to fill the gap allowing users to leverage GenAI tools to post content, videos and sell or resell products.\u00a0 In its earlier format, Roposo allowed the creators and influencers to use dropshipping to deliver products through Roposo Clout. Influencers could use  Shop 101 (also acquired by InMobi)  to purchase products and sell them on the Roposo app for a cut of the transaction.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether the users on its social commerce platform can also avail products and services from Clout or Shop 101. InMobi  acquired Roposo  in 2019 and was one of the dozens of short video apps that looked to fill the vacuum left behind by TikTok in 2020 after its ban from India. It was originally acquired to bolster InMobi\u2019s Glance product which displays ads and links on smartphone lockscreens\u00a0 Before the acquisition, Roposo had raised $38 Mn in funding from investors such as Tiger Global, Bertelsmann India. InMobi is meanwhile planning to expand its video commerce business substantially by integrating GenAI tools within Glance and Roposo. Naveen Tiwari, CEO, InMobi  reportedly said  that leveraging AI for Glance would unlock new consumption patterns by helping smartphone users buy from their lock screens instead of from individual apps.\u00a0 With Instagram and YouTube dominating in terms of users, Indian short video apps have struggled to monetise and have looked at various new streams to remain relevant. VerSe Innovation\u2019s Josh and ShareChat-backed Moj have tested video commerce in the hope that it will bring in the users and brands, but the outcome has not been favourable in terms of revenue and traction.\u00a0 In June this year, Flipkart  said  that video commerce offering is gaining popularity with more than 75 Mn users having watched videos while shopping on the app between January 2024 and June 2024 on its curated video sections \u2018Liveshop+\u2019 and \u2018Vibes\u2019. \u201cWe have realised that just short-form content will be extremely challenging to monetize in the wake of increasing streaming costs, server expenses and influencer charges. Ecommerce industry growth in particular that of quick commerce platforms has also led to many players now strategising ways to engage audiences/ users and which is why video commerce will be crucial,\u201d VerSe CEO Umang Bedi told  Inc42 earlier.\u00a0 InMobi\u2019 is betting that features such as product discoverability will set it apart from others in this space. Roposo\u2019s Jain added that AI will unlock new commerce behaviour. \u201cThe world of Gen AI can change the way products are being sold and purchased which is what we are working on now and will be launched soon,\u201d she claimed.

        "Article Content": "The spirit of digital transformation in India is gaining significant momentum, particularly among MSMEs. These enterprises contribute  45% of industrial output  40% of exports, and produce over 8,000 high-quality products for domestic and international markets.\u00a0 MSMEs have significantly contributed to the country\u2019s economic growth recently, but there is still room for improvement. Enhanced regulatory compliance has made it essential for them to leverage advanced tools and technology. For example, e-invoicing introduced by the GST council initially became mandatory for businesses with a turnover exceeding INR 500 Cr\u2014a threshold that has recently been revised to  INR 5 Cr. \u00a0 E-invoicing  can significantly reduce the risks associated with manual invoice processing, including high time and staffing costs, strained supplier and customer relationships, and the risk of inventory shipment cut-offs. The government aimed to simplify the tax system and promote digital inclusivity in a phased manner. Initially introduced for large organizations, e-invoicing has become necessary for small businesses. By including MSMEs in the e-invoicing fold, they can become part of the formal economy and contribute substantially to the country\u2019s economy. The GST system has streamlined transactions, billing, enhancing compliance and increasing tax revenues. However, challenges remain, including fake invoices, fraudulent registrations, and improper input tax credit claims. To address these problems, advanced technology solutions across value chains are essential. The government has implemented several measures to combat these issues, such as e-invoicing, the e-way bill system, auto-population of key information, and mandatory invoice matching for input tax credit claims. MSMEs require advanced tools and innovative software solutions to stay compliant with evolving GST norms, achieve sustainable growth, and remain competitive in domestic and international markets. However, financial constraints and the high cost of a skilled workforce make it challenging for them to upgrade to advanced technology. Therefore, MSMEs need an affordable and effective solution for regulatory compliance. The answer lies in embracing SaaS solutions.\u00a0\u00a0 Fintechs recognise the above benefits and the government\u2019s aim to improve the GST filing processing and step up to contribute to achieving them. They offer SaaS-based invoicing platforms that replace manual paper invoice processing with streamlined electronic systems, including validation, approval, and simplified global invoice payment and reconciliation. These platforms aim to prevent fraud and errors while ensuring compliance with tax regulations.\u00a0 This approach will help to expand the GST base and improve transparency in the taxation system by facilitating better synchronisation of sales data and input tax credit claims. The significance of this approach was highlighted in December 2023, when   4,153 bogus firms suspected  of ITC evasion totaling approximately INR 12,036 Cr were detected.\u00a0 SaaS-based invoicing platforms can prevent fraud by maintaining data integrity, ensuring that the information remains unchanged from when the supplier creates the invoice to when the buyer makes the payment. These automated invoices offer security and fraud protection through secure delivery, advanced encryption, and legally binding security elements like e signatures.\u00a0 Governments, financing organizations, service providers, and tax authorities are eager to review the insights within this data.\u00a0 From a financial perspective, an e-invoicing platform can facilitate access to short-term unsecured loans by enhancing trust among financiers in identifying legitimate trade transactions. Fintechs use digital data and strategic partnerships to offer low-risk  supply chain financing  (SCF) options to smaller businesses that traditional lenders often overlook. This support empowers credit-constrained MSMEs and fosters sustainable relationships between financial institutions and these enterprises. The growth of globalisation and digital trading has made tax collection more challenging due to increasing incidents of frauds, but SaaS-based invoicing is a powerful platform for reducing fraud and increasing revenue. This is not just a domestic trend;   over 55 countries worldwide   have adopted or are considering e-invoicing mandates due to its numerous advantages. MSMEs recognise these benefits and are increasingly transitioning to SaaS-based invoicing platforms for daily business operations and financial processes. The true potential of SaaS platforms is realised when MSMEs collaborate and share data securely. This collective approach allows them to gain valuable insights, predict trends, and make well-informed decisions. These platforms are crucial for automating invoicing processes for transitioning to a real-time economy, where the swift exchange of critical business information between trading partners is key to growth and success.\u00a0 Moreover, utilising digital public infrastructure (DPI) like e-way bills enables MSMEs and consumers to achieve greater value for money while reducing compliance burdens for producers. The e-way bill system\u2019s digital record-keeping simplifies compliance, reduces errors, and ensures accurate transaction records, leading to smoother audits and inspections. Looking ahead, MSMEs can harness SaaS technology to stay compliant and secure in the evolving tax landscape. By adopting digital solutions, MSMEs can streamline their operations, improve transparency, and effectively adapt to regulatory changes, ensuring ongoing growth and resilience in a dynamic business environment.",

        "Article Content": "India\u2019s flourishing tech landscape is no longer the sole domain of elite business school graduates. The past decade has seen celebrities capitalise on the growth of the world\u2019s third-largest startup ecosystem.\u00a0 Leading the pack are imminent names like Deepika Padukone and Alia Bhatt, who are founding startups, particularly in the booming omnichannel D2C space. Even cricketers are joining the game, with established ventures from MS Dhoni and Deepak Chahar\u2019s recent launch of a fantasy gaming platform. Celebrities are actively building businesses, embracing the core principles of entrepreneurship and investing heavily. The year 2023 witnessed a record year for celebrity investors, with Inc42 reporting over 19 personalities infusing capital into 26 startups, including prominent figures like Akshay Kumar and Sunil Shetty. At a time when angel investment is on the rise, let\u2019s steal a glance at the list of Indian celebrity founders who\u2019ve become the talk of the Indian startup town in recent years. Note: This is not an exhaustive list or ranking of any kind. An avid startup investor, Alia Bhatt solidified her footprint in the Indian startup ecosystem with the  launch of Ed-a-Mamma , a kidswear D2C brand, in 2020. Unlike most celebrity brands, which are either co-created or have a revenue-sharing model, Ed-a-Mamma was initially fully funded by Bhatt. The startup has been operating on an omnichannel model, selling across ecommerce platforms, its website, and offline retail chains, including Lifestyle and Shoppers\u2019 Stop. In September 2023, Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL) acquired a majority stake in Ed-a-Mamma. Besides her entrepreneurial journey with Ed-a-Mamma, as an investor, Bhatt\u2019s startup portfolio includes the personal styling platform Style Cracker and biomaterial startup Phool. She also has investments in beauty and fashion ecommerce major Nykaa.\u00a0 Indian cricketer Deepak Chahar announced his entry into the Indian startup space with the launch of a fantasy gaming platform,  Trade Fantasy Game (TFG), in February 2023 . The startup, cofounded by Jaya Chahar (Deepak\u2019s wife), was incorporated with an internal investment of INR 10 Cr in March 2022. The parent entity of TFG, JCDC Sports Pvt Ltd, offers a premium experience of playing collectable and card-based fantasy games on its platform. At the time of its launch, TFG aimed to foster 1 Mn users by FY24 and generate revenues of INR 18 Cr by FY25. It is pertinent to note that the Chahars are trying to make waves in the Indian fantasy gaming arena dominated by the likes of Dream11, Mobile Premier League (MPL) and others.\u00a0 In addition, the cricketer owns a D2C sportswear brand DNINE Sports. Launched in September 2023 with an investment of INR 2.5 Cr. The brand sells sports apparel, shoes, accessories, and dietary supplements via its website. Chahar and his father Lokendra Singh Chahar serve as the cofounders of the brand.\u00a0 Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone entered the Indian startup ecosystem as an investor. Spacetech startup Bellatrix Aerospace and electric rise-hailing platform Blusmart have been able to lap up Padukone\u2019s interest. Taking the entrepreneurial leap of faith, Padukone founded personal care brand 82\u00b0E, along with Jigar Shah, in 2021.\u00a0 The D2C brand was launched in November 2022 with a core focus on skincare products. Currently, 82\u00b0E has products in skincare and fosters a separate personal care line for men (82\u00b0E Man). In December 2022, the startup  raised $7.5 Mn in seed funding  from DSG Consumer Partners and IDEO Ventures, along with multiple ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNIs) and Padukone\u2019s family office.  82\u00b0E is now raising around $6 Mn  as a part of its extended seed funding round with Deepika Padukone and her father Prakash Padukone\u2019s investment entity, Ka Enterprises, increasing its stake in the startup. Meanwhile, Padukone has also increased her investment portfolio with startups like Epigamia, Furlenco, Atomberg, Mokobara, and Nua.\u00a0 The actor turned into an entrepreneur in 2013 with the launch of his lifestyle brand HRX, which sells a range of products, including sportswear, footwear, casualwear, and accessories for men and women. In 2016, Flipkart-owned Myntra bought a 51% stake in HRX. With time, HRX has diversified into selling gym equipment and wearables. In 2017, the brand joined hands with Cult.fit (which is now a fitness unicorn) and launched the first-ever celebrity-designed HRX workout regime across Cult centres in India. Bollywood actress and model Katrina Kaif forayed into the beauty and personal care space with the launch of makeup brand Kay Beauty in 2019.\u00a0\u00a0 Striking the right balance between glamour and skincare, the brand sells products like hydrating foundation, creme blush, liquid highlighter, and lip oil gloss, among other beauty products.\u00a0 Following the launch of the brand, Kaif also infused an undisclosed amount in Nykaa through a  secondary transaction in 2020 . With the investment, Kay Beauty became an in-house brand of the listed beauty and personal care major.\u00a0 Now, Nykaa owns a 51% stake in Kay Beauty. Recently, at the Startup Mahakumbh, Nykaa\u2019s founder Falguni Nayar said that the company was expecting to generate INR 200 Cr from Kay Beauty in FY24.\u00a0 Kriti Sanon joined the startup bandwagon by  cofounding fitness brand \u2018The Tribe\u2019  in 2022, along with Anushka Nandani, Karan Sawhney and Robin Behl The Tribe offers virtual and \u2018in-studio\u2019 products including training workshops and tailor-made nutrition plans. Last year, Sanon also joined hands with PEP Technologies, the parent company of mCaffeine, to launch skincare brand Hyphen.\u00a0 Hyphen offers 21 SKUs for comprehensive facial care, including cleansers, moisturisers, serums, sunscreens, lip balms and anti-pigmentation products. The startup claims to have  clocked INR 14 Cr in FY24 and INR 100 Cr in annualised gross sales in July 2024 . Former Indian cricket team Indian cricketer MS Dhoni is the brand ambassador and partial owner of the lifestyle brand SEVEN. The brand was launched in 2016 by RS Seven Lifestyle (P) Ltd, which is a part of Rhiti Group. Apart from this, Dhoni is also a big-time startup investor. He has investments in more than eight Indian startups. Some of the noteworthy startups in his investment portfolio include Tagda Raho, Rigi, Shaka Harry, Garuda, HomeLane, 7ink Brews, Khatabook and Cars24. In 2012, Dhoni also started a gym chain in India, SportsFit World Pvt Ltd. More recently, in April 2024,  EV Startup EMotorad roped in Dhoni  as an equity investor. Founded in 2020, EMotorad sells electric cycles for daily commuting and casual rides. It aims to offer travel alternatives through premium electric cycles and promote a healthier lifestyle. Apart from having his investment in the startup, Dhoni is also the brand ambassador of EMotorad.\u00a0 The iconic Bollywood actor began her entrepreneurial journey in 2008 as a co-owner of Indian Premier League (IPL) team Punjab Kings. Despite being on a long acting career break, Preity Zinta shined as an entrepreneur with the growing popularity of IPL.\u00a0 Most recently, Zinta gave a new boost to her entrepreneurial career by signing up as a cofounder of a member-based gym facility  DRIVE FITT . Cofounded by Zinta, along with cricketer Shubman Gill, and Australian businessmen Mark Sellar and Deke Smith, DRIVE FITT aims to provide cricket training facilities. It will offer high-tech bowling machines, yoga studios, comprehensive strength, conditioning, and cardio training with gym amenities. DRIVE FITT plans to open its flagship facility later this year. Indian actor Priyanka Chopra Jonas launched her haircare brand named Anomaly in 2021 starting with the US market. Anomaly\u2019s range of products, including dry shampoos, shampoos, hair masks and conditioners, was first available across US-based retail giant Target\u2019s online and offline stores. In 2022, Nykaa tapped Anomaly for an exclusive launch of its products in India. Currently, the brand\u2019s products are available across Nykaa, Amazon, and Flipkart. Jonas has also been an investor for a long time. In 2018, she had invested in two US-based startups \u2013 Holberton School and dating app Bumble.\u00a0 Indian actress Rakul Preet Singh forayed into the Indian startup space in 2021 when she launched a LinkedIn-like talent discovery platform, Starring You, along with her brother Aman Preet Singh.\u00a0 With the app, the actress aims to bridge the gap between aspiring talent and talent hunters in the entertainment field. The app has over 10,000 downloads on Google\u2019s Play Store. After making her first entrepreneurial leap with Starring You, Singh focussed on a vertical outside of the entertainment business for her next endeavour. With an aim to make baby care safe, effective and ecological, she joined hands with Shreya Chadalavada and Jahnavi Reddy Dorigallu to launch D2C startup NewBoo in 2023. The brand sells reusable baby diapers that use soft material and are liquid absorbent.\u00a0 Besides,  the actress invested in Wellbeing Nutrition in 2022 . She is also the startup\u2019s brand ambassador.\u00a0 Actor Rana Daggubati, who gained nationwide fame after the meteoric success of the movie \u2018 Bahubali\u2019 , is an active investor in the startup ecosystem. Besides having a stake in startups like the Ghost Kitchen, the actor also dawned the entrepreneurial hat in 2021, when he ventured into the then-blooming Metaverse and NFT space to start IKONZ. He partnered with Abinav Varma Kalidindi to launch the startup. In 2022,  IKONZ raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding  from early-stage VC firm Village Global, which is backed by the life of Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, and technology investment firm Woodstock. The platform helps IP owners and artists in the space monetise their digital assets by providing access to crypto communities worldwide. Since its inception, the startup has collaborated with brands like Amar Chitra Katha and Tinkle to bring entertainment IPs to the metaverse.\u00a0 Besides this, he also set up a fan engagement startup Socialswag with actor Akshay Kumar as his cofounder. The startup offers a skill and talent development platform with celebrity-led courses. Soon after the launch in April 2021, Socialswag bagged close to $1 Mn in its seed funding round from multiple angel investors. Actor Ranveer Singh became one of the cofounders of D2C sexual wellness startup Bold Care after he invested  an undisclosed amount in the startup  in December 2023. Singh is also the face of the brand.\u00a0 Apart from Bold Care, the actor also serves as an investor for other startups. He recently invested in  Aman Gupta\u2019s bOAt  and Vineeta Singh\u2019s D2C brand Sugar Cosmetics in 2022.\u00a0 Samantha Ruth Prabhu, a well-known figure in the South Indian movie industry, began her entrepreneurial journey even before she gained fame as a leading actress in multiple Bollywood films. Her involvement in the Indian startup ecosystem started in September 2020, when she partnered with former Miss India contestant Sushruthi Krishna to launch the D2C fashion and lifestyle brand Saaki. Saaki specialises in Indian women\u2019s fashion, including kurtas and sarees. Prabhu serves as the cofounder and \u2018chief style editor\u2019 for the brand, which competes with other well-known names such as BIBA, Indya, Fabindia, Nykaa Fashion, and various D2C fashion brands. In addition to her role at Saaki, Prabhu is also an investor in the ecommerce marketplace SustainKart and the D2C superfoods brand Nourish You. From donning heavy jewellery onscreen to taking up the cofounder office in a prominent jewellery startup, actress Shraddha Kapoor took the entrepreneurial leap of faith earlier this year.\u00a0 Pune-based jewellery startup  Palmonas roped in Kapoor as its new cofounder  in March 2024. Incorporated by Pallavi Mohadikar and Amol Patwari in 2021, the startup sells affordable premium quality jewellery to their users.\u00a0 Their range of jewellery options, including necklaces, rings, bracelets, and earrings, are priced between INR 800 and INR 5,500 and sold with a one-year warranty. It is pertinent to note that Kapoor made headlines last year when she appeared in a TV commercial of Melorra, which is Palmonas competitor in the jewellery space. Post this, Kapoor commented on one of Palmonas\u2019 posts on Instagram and said she \u201cwas just blown away by their products\u201d. With Kapoor on board, Palmonas\u2019 founders aim to leverage her popularity to expand the reach. The startup has launched a collection called Shraddha\u2019s Stack, which includes necklaces, rings, and earrings.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t Kapoor\u2019s first jaunt in the Indian startup ecosystem though. She turned into an investor for beauty commerce unicorn The Good Glamm Group in 2021. She also invested in startups Shunya and Chargeup in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Having garnered a reputation for being an accomplished actor as well as a philanthropist, Sonu Sood is also well known for his entrepreneurial ventures outside of the spotlight. Sood launched Pravasi Rojgar, a job portal for migrant workers, in collaboration with Schoolnet India in July 2020.\u00a0 The aim to help millions of migrant workers find jobs & a steady source of income. The startup also trains workers with the requisite skills to increase their chances of obtaining good jobs. The startup secured  INR 250 Cr in funding  from Temasek Holding-backed Goodworker. Apart from Pravasi Rojgar, Sood launched an AI-enabled social media app Explurger in 2022. Explurger, which is a freemium app, helps users interact with their friends and family. It creates automatic travelogues using artificial intelligence (AI), gamifies the user experience, and rewards users for being socially active on the app. Earlier this year, the  startup raised $4.5 Mn  in its Series A funding round led by Affle (India) Ltd.\u00a0 Apart from his entrepreneurial ventures, Sood also turned an investor in 2020. Through his company Sood Informatics LLP (SIL), he purchased over 8.69 Lakh shares of rural  fintech firm Spice Money  at a price of INR 10 per share. With the investment, he turned brand ambassador and a non-executive board member for the startup.",

        "Article Content": "India\u2019s private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) landscape is already bracing itself for a slew of changes \u2014 from  skill-based certification for key personnel  at AIFs to more transparency in how  their funds are being liquidated . Many of these, of course, don\u2019t affect Indian VC firms run by professional fund managers, but the latest demand by SEBI is likely to change that. According to an ET  report , SEBI recently asked AIFs or Indian VC firms to reveal which of their investors or limited partners (LPs) have entered into deals with preferential terms or a bigger say in the deal making process. Of course, this has opened up concerns about whether VC funds are being fair and equal in courting the interest of HNIs, family offices, corporate funds and institutional investors alike. As per SEBI data, India is home to over 1,200 AIFs and many of these have launched multiple schemes or funds over the years, and much of the investment in Indian startups happens through these AIFs, which raise capital through LPs across classes as mentioned above. Sources in the industry tell us that SEBI has received complaints from some influential LPs about preferential treatment to other limited partners. The practice in question is called a side letter or a contribution agreement, and in many cases, it governs terms for preferential returns timelines as well as exposure of the LP to certain kinds of assets. In some cases, limited partners want to pay lower fees, which could be the case for corporate LPs or institutional funds, whereas HNIs and family offices might be asked to pay more. Fund managers claim this is typical practice because the former class of LPs contributes more to a corpus, whereas the latter are more in number. So consider the example of some Indian VC firms which have existed for well over a decade. In these cases, the corpus size typically grows significantly from one fund to another. In these cases, the increase in the corpus is more likely to come from institutional or corporate LPs rather than several dozens of HNIs. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that SEBI is asking now about LPs and the private placement memorandum (PPM). PPM should be standard for everyone, but we all know that\u2019s not the case. In fact, even those LPs that may be complaining now knew about it,\u201c says a Bengaluru-based early stage fund manager. It\u2019s very possible that such side letters were allowed by SEBI when startup investments and AIFs were not everywhere. But that\u2019s not the case anymore. The biggest example is  Shark Tank India , which will soon go into production for its fourth season. The show was well-timed, coming at the tail end of 2021, when the pandemic had turned many Indian startups such as into household brands. And it garnered plenty of attention due to bombastic angel investors or sharks. And this is just my opinion \u2014 since then Shark Tank India has matured and it\u2019s no longer a shouty reality show. Its third season actually merited some praise for how it dealt with critical aspects of building a brand or startup. But that\u2019s just one example. We have also seen a  proliferation of micro VC firms  \u2014 a trend we covered a couple of weeks ago \u2014 and family offices looking to diversify. It\u2019s only right that some of these family offices backed by traditional and legacy businesses might have some concerns about how AIFs and VC funds invest their money. One multi-family office fund manager told Inc42 that typically large institutional LPs get a 25% discount on management fees, 1.5% vs the 2% that other LPs pay. To compensate for those LPs that backed a fund during its first close, investors in subsequent round closes are charged an equalisation premium. Larger conglomerates such as Reliance and Tata are also LPs in funds, and such large corporate venture funds tend to get favourable terms in the market from funds, especially those run by pedigreed fund managers. \u00a0\u201cHaving a large CVC as a corporate LP means your portfolio gets direct exposure to the LP\u2019s network, which then allows them to scale up and grow faster. It\u2019s a win-win for the fund manager and the other LPs. But it\u2019s a problem when large corporate giants become acquisitive and acquire companies in the fund\u2019s portfolio in distress situations.\u201d This leaves other LPs holding the bag of losses. Such a case gained prominence in 2021 when Reliance  invested in Kalaari Capital  on the heels of acquiring four companies in Kalaari\u2019s portfolio, with Urban Ladder acquired at a 75% discount to its last valuation. \u201cAsking for more transparency from the entities it regulates is SEBI\u2019s prerogative. But as an investor I also want to have the right kind of diversification in my portfolio, so now it will become tricky for me to invest in pooled funds if SEBI bars side letters,\u201d according to a principal at a Mumbai-based private equity firm. This is where side letters are used as leverage by fund managers to bring on large LPs. These LPs may have investment policies that forbid investments in certain business sectors, so fund managers have to accommodate their requests if they want their capital. All the capital raised ends up in a blind pool, but with side letters in play, the pool is not so blind. It means fund managers have enough visibility of the pool to know which LPs to draw down or basically call in the commitment. So when the fund is investing in an EV startup but the large automobile OEM that is a major LP does not want that exposure, the fund is forced to ask for a bigger drawdown from its other LPs to fulfil the round. The argument can be extended to any disruptive startup that is seeking capital from funds that have incumbents as LPs. If SEBI bars side letters, many of these rounds might indeed fall through the cracks as the fund will be unable to meet the commitment. In recent times it has become clear that SEBI has looked to standardise AIFs and startup investments. Side letters and special deals run contrary to this direction. Since side letters govern terms related to management fees at times, many LPs feel short changed when there is disparity in these terms. It can lead to friction between LPs and this could lead to reputational damage to the VC firm and the fund manager. More importantly SEBI\u2019s rules are likely to be harder on existing large funds since they have a longer track record and have the potential to have the same LPs over multiple funds and therefore a higher likelihood of side letters. While AIFs might find it easier to manage all LPs with one agreement, it does make it harder to raise large corpuses. Will SEBI bar side letters? That\u2019s unlikely to happen, according to some of the fund managers that we spoke to, because that will severely impact fundraising. \u201cSEBI will probably want more transparency. It has asked for performance reporting to some degree so now next it wants LP reports. Some clauses may be targetted but it\u2019s not likely that the practice will be disallowed,\u201d the PE investor quoted above added. But SEBI has a track record of doing that with public markets, even though these were not really side letters. Before July this year, stock exchanges offered brokers discounts on fees based on their trading volume. Simply put, higher trade volumes for a broker meant lower fee costs and more profits. But SEBI introduced uniform charges in July, to effectively end volume-based discounts. That is quite different from standardising the PE and VC world, since their structures are so different and they cater to investors with longer horizons. A crackdown on side letters means large institutional investors \u2014 particularly those that want to avoid exposure to particular sectors \u2014 might park their money elsewhere. And that doesn\u2019t help Indian VC funds or startups.",

        "Article Content": "Lending tech unicorn Moneyview has bought Mumbai-based fintech platform Jify in a share swap deal to expand its offerings. However, the company did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. As part of the deal, Jify\u2019s existing backers Accel and Nexus Venture Partners were allotted shares of Moneyview. This comes on the back of Moneyview entering the coveted  unicorn club after raking in INR 38.6 Cr  (about $4.6 Mn) in an equity funding round from Accel India and Nexus Ventures.\u00a0 As per Inc42 calculations, the startup was valued at $1.2 Bn in the funding round. Earlier this month, the startup\u2019s board of directors approved issuance and allotment of 60.23 Lakh equity shares to Accel and Nexus Ventures at INR 64.15 apiece. While Accel invested INR 19.5 Cr in the startup, Nexus invested INR 19.1 Cr, as per its filings with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. This comes shortly after the startup\u2019s board passed a special resolution  to raise INR 250 Cr (around $29.8 Mn)  debt from unidentified investors through private placement of non-convertible debentures.\u00a0 Moneyview said in a statement that the buyout will help it strengthen its financial offerings and scale up user base, while also facilitating Jify to expand its offerings to more customers and enterprises. \u201cThe acquisition also marks a significant milestone in Moneyview\u2019s ongoing expansion into a diverse range of financial products ranging from credit to savings and investment products catering to every Indian with a smartphone,\u201d the statement added. Moneyview\u2019s CEO Puneet Agarwal said, \u201cWe are eager to use this collaboration as a way to strengthen and grow the strong customer base that Jify caters to and take it to new heights. As we move ahead, we will continue to bring more such solutions that will enable our current and prospective users to manage all their financial needs under one roof.\u201d \u201cMoneyview, with it\u2019s range of financial solutions spanning credit, personal finance, insurance, and savings products, will enable Jify to serve over 10 million employees within the next two years and establish ourselves as the premier employee financial wellness platform for salaried individuals,\u201d said Jify\u2019s cofounder and CEO Anisha Dossa. Founded in 2014 by Puneet Agarwal and Sanjay Aggarwal, Moneyview offers personal loans, personal finance management solutions, and credit trackers. It competes with the likes of Flexiloans, Fibe, among others.\u00a0\u00a0 Prior to this funding, Moneyview raised  $75 Mn in its Series E funding round  led by Apis Partners at a valuation of $900 Mn in December 2022.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Jify, founded in 2021 by Dossa, Aditya Mehta and Anusha Ramakrishnan, is an employee financial management platform that claims to offer financial wellness through earned salary access and better money management tools. In 2022, it raised  $10 Mn from Accel and Nexus Venture Partners  as part of its Series A funding round. Following the latest funding round, Moneyview has become the sixth startup to enter the unicorn club this year after Krutrim, Perfios, RateGain, Ather Energy, and Rapido. Earlier this month,  Rapido raised $200 Mn  in a Series E funding round led by existing investor WestBridge Capital at a valuation of $1.1 Bn. \u00a0",

Accel also claims that 70% of its portfolio comprises founders building their startups in AI.\u00a0 In March, the VC firm  selected eight startups,  including Spintly, Asets and Tune AI, among others, for  its six-month pre-seed accelerator programme Atoms 3.0. The programme focused on startups building in AI and Industry 5.0 domains. As per the company,  in the first three Accel Atoms cohorts,  over 32 startups have  collectively raised over $200M from global investors so far . Yesterday, Accel-backed lending tech startup Moneyview  entered the unicorn club   after raising INR 38.6 Cr (about $4.6 Mn) in an equity funding round, escalating the company\u2019s valuation to $1.2 Bn. \u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Shares of Mamaearth\u2019s parent entity Honasa Consumer Ltd fell over 6% to a low of INR 490 apiece on the NSE during early trading today (September 12) after a 10.9% stake in the company changed hands via a block deal estimated at INR 1,763.3 Cr. About 3.5 Cr shares of Honasa were traded in the transaction at a floor price of INR 500, a discount of over 4% from the previous close, CNBC-TV18 reported. However, identities of the buyers and sellers have not been disclosed. Earlier, it was reported that Peak XV Partners, Sequoia Capital, Redwood Trust, Fireside Ventures, Stellaris Ventures and Sofina Ventures planned to divest up to 8.1% stake in Honasa through block deals. The deal size was likely increased to 10.9% today. As of the quarter ended June 2024, Peak XV Partners held a 18.69% equity stake in Honasa. The stock hit its  record high of INR 547 apiece  on the NSE on Tuesday (September 10). However, it succumbed to selling pressure in the first half of today\u2019s trading session and was trading 5% lower at INR 495.7 apiece on the NSE at 10:43 AM. The block deal follows an earlier one in June, when Fireside Ventures and Sofina Ventures likely  sold a 2% stake in Honasa  for INR 291 Cr. Founded in 2016 by the husband-wife duo of Varun and Ghazal Alagh, Honasa\u2019s product portfolio comprises six beauty and personal care brands which include Mamaearth, The Derma Co., Aqualogica, Ayuga, BBlunt and Dr. Sheth\u2019s. Honasa  posted a 62.9% jump in its profit after tax (PAT) to INR 40.2 Cr  in the June quarter (Q1) of the financial year 2024-25 (FY25) from INR 24.7 Cr in the same quarter of previous year. Mamaearth\u2019s operating revenue witnessed a strong growth of 19.3% on a year-on-year (YoY) basis and 17.3% sequentially to increase to INR 554 Cr in the reported quarter. \u00a0",

        "Article Content": "In a major setback for Rapido, the Karnataka Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) has reportedly held that the ride hailing unicorn is liable to pay goods and service tax for its cab services. \u201cThe applicant (Rapido\u2019s parent company Roppen Transportation) is liable to pay GST on the supply of services provided by the independent four-wheeler cab service provider (person who has subscribed to the applicant\u2019s  Rapido  app) to his passengers on the applicant\u2019s app platform, being an ecommerce operator, in terms of Section 9 (5) of the CGST Act 2017,\u201d the ARR order was quoted as saying by ET. As part of the hearing, Rapido submitted that it charges its drivers a subscription instead of a commission, without making any revenue on the fare. It is pertinent to note that the retrospective ruling will open Rapido to previous tax dues on its cab services.\u00a0 This also comes at a time when Rapido turned unicorn after raising a funding of $120 Mn from its existing investor WestBridge Capital at a post-money valuation of  a little over $1 Bn. \u00a0 Last year in December, it entered th e cab booking services  category with the launch of Rapido Cabs. The Swiggy-backed company then said it had a fleet of around 1 Lakh cabs on its platform and the service is currently operational across Delhi NCR, Hyderabad and Bengaluru.\u00a0 Inc42 has reached out to Rapido for comments on the development. The story will be updated based on the response.\u00a0 This Karnataka ARR further adds to the ambiguity regarding the GST applicability on the ride-hailing companies operating via a subscription model with their drivers and service providers.\u00a0 Contrary to this ruling, the Karnataka ARR ruled in favour of\u00a0 Namma Yatri which offers a subscription-based model to its driver-partners, allowing it to not pay GST. In the case involving Juspay Technologies, the company behind the Namma Yatri mobility platform, the AAR relied on the dictionary definition of the word \u201cthrough.\u201d It concluded that merely linking service providers with customers via a digital platform does not constitute a supply of service and is thus not subject to tax. The same Karnataka authority had previously issued an opposite ruling in the case of Opta Cabs Pvt Ltd. Additionally, the Tamil Nadu Advance Ruling Authority, in a recent decision regarding Balat Enterprises Pvt Ltd, held that the company, which provides a platform for small business owners to connect with customers, is liable to discharge tax under Section 9(5) of the CGST law for specified services. Not to mention, these ride-hailing platforms incur a 5% GST on the fair for rides they facilitate through the commission model. However, under the subscription model, these platforms charge a daily or weekly fee to driver partners to avail of the offerings given by ride-hailing platforms like getting recognised by customers.\u00a0 This development comes against the backdrop of other major players like Ola and Uber introducing their subscription-based models for their three-wheeler booking services. Meanwhile, earlier this month it was also reported that platforms such as Uber have approached the finance ministry  seeking clarity on if their business  was liable to incur indirect tax or not.\u00a0 Earlier this year, the  Karnataka transport department fixed uniform fares  for all taxis plying in the state, including metre-based taxis. Under the new regime, the app-based cab aggregators will not be able to levy surge charges to customers during peak hours. These app-based cab services have also been scrutinised by other state governments, like those in Delhi and Maharashtra, for various reasons",

        "Article Content": "Beauty and fashion ecommerce startup  Nykaa  has allocated 7.65 Lakh equity shares under its employee stock option (ESOP) schemes.\u00a0 In an exchange filing, the startup said, \u201cWe wish to inform you that the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of FSN E-Commerce Ventures Limited (\u2018Company\u2019) on September 12, 2024 has allotted 7,65,086 equity shares.\u201d\u00a0 The company said that the equity shares were allotted pursuant to the exercise of vested stock options under ESOP schemes.\u00a0 As per the closing price of Nykaa shares today, the total value of these 7.65 Lakh equity shares is about INR 15.9 Cr. The company\u2019s shares ended today\u2019s trading session 1.9% lower at INR 207.65 on the BSE. Prior to this, Nykaa allotted  INR 3.13 Cr worth of 1.73 Lakh equity shares  in July. It also allotted  4.73 Lakh  shares in June.\u00a0 Earlier today, Kotak Institutional Equities  downgraded Nykaa  to \u2018sell\u2019 from the earlier \u2018add\u2019 rating. The brokerage said that the startup\u2019s focus on faster deliveries may negatively impact its EBITDA margin. Kotak also cut its fair value of the stock to INR 190 from INR 195 earlier. Notably, Nykaa reported an operating revenue of INR 1,746.1 Cr and a net profit of INR 13.6 Cr in Q1 FY25. Its total gross merchandise value (GMV)  increased 25% year-on-year (YoY)  to INR 3,320.9 Cr. The company\u2019s EBITDA margin improved 34 basis points YoY to 5.5% during the quarter. The latest development comes at the time when more than half of the founders are  banking on ESOPs  to attract employees to the startup ecosystem in 2024. As a result, an increasing number of new-age tech startups are offering ESOPs to their employees. For instance, Tracxn allotted 1.8 Lakh equity shares earlier this month under its ESOP schemes, while Delhivery allotted 6.15 Lakh equity shares on Tuesday (10 September). ",

The brokerage said Nykaa might witness higher fulfillment costs due to quicker deliveries, adversely impacting its EBITDA margin.\u00a0 \u201cAlready, it is making efforts to extend same-day/next-day delivery across 63 cities; this may need to become even faster in the current quick commerce-driven delivery environment. We trim our FY2025-27 EBITDA estimates by 3-7%, as we model lower margins in BPC and eB2B,\u201d said Kotak analysts. Shares of Nykaa, which fell in two previous consecutive sessions this week, fell almost 2% during the intraday trading sessions today (September 12). By 1.15 PM IST, Nykaa shares were trading 1.9% lower at INR 207.7 on the BSE. Despite its slightly negative view, Kotak also noted that Nykaa\u2019s wider assortment, content-based marketing and increasing personalisation will help the company counter the increasing assortment and city reach of quick commerce companies. \u201c \u2026we believe Nykaa\u2019s discovery-driven BPC experience remains differentiated,\u201d the analysts said.\u00a0 Kotak expects Nykaa to continue adding to its already large SKU count, curating better offerings for customers and utilising its longer customer history to offer superior recommendations and content. \u201cA detailed analysis of BPC product offerings on quick commerce platforms reveals that the assortment in a few key categories is increasing on these platforms. Overall, we found these platforms carry 4-8% of the number of SKUs available on Nykaa\u2019s platform across categories such as colour cosmetics, skincare, haircare, bath and body. The overall difference in assortment is still stark, with our analysis totalling to about 76K SKUs for Nykaa across these categories compared with 4-6K SKUs for quick-commerce,\u201d said Kotak. In the last reported quarter,  Q1 FY25 , the GMV of Nykaa\u2019s BPC business rose 28% YoY to INR 2,542.9 Cr. Its total GMV stood at INR 3,320.9 Cr in the quarter. The company\u2019s EBITDA margin stood at 5.5%, which grew 34 basis points YoY. Nykaa posted a net profit of INR 13.6 Cr on an operating revenue of INR 1,746.1 Cr in Q1.",

        "Article Content": "The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has reportedly found ecommerce giants Amazon and Walmart-backed Flipkart guilty of violating competition laws.\u00a0 As per two separate internal antitrust reports seen by Reuters, the competition watchdog found that both Amazon India and Flipkart flouted antitrust guidelines by giving preference to select sellers on their platforms.\u00a0 \u201cEach of the anti-competitive practices alleged\u2026 were investigated and found to be true\u2026 Ordinary sellers remained as mere database entries,\u201d read identical conclusions in both the reports. While the two companies have previously denied any wrongdoings, both Amazon and Flipkart will now have time to review the report and file any objections before the CCI decides on the potential fines against them.\u00a0 In its report on Amazon, CCI reportedly alleged that preferred sellers on the ecommerce platform received \u201cadvantage in the (online) listing\u201d, adding that a customer\u2019s \u201cattention\u201d was drawn towards the listing when he/she searches for any product. The watchdog also noted that the practice of preferential listings and deep discounting tactics employed by Amazon, especially with regards to sale of mobile phones, was causing a \u201ccatastrophic impact on the existing competition in the market\u201d. Meanwhile, with regards to Flipkart, the Commission said that preferred sellers were provided various services such as marketing and delivery at a \u201cminiscule cost\u201d. The watchdog added that such sellers were also \u201cenabled\u201d by Flipkart to sell phones with deep discounts, thereby foreclosing competition and leading to \u201cpredatory pricing\u201d. \u201cThe anti-competitive practices are not limited to sales of mobile phones. They are equally prevalent in other categories of goods,\u201d both the reports said.\u00a0 This comes three years after the  CCI, in 2020, ordered a probe against Amazon and Flipkart  after receiving complaints from trade body Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh. The watchdog probed allegations that both the ecommerce platforms prioritised certain listings and promoted certain sellers with which the two companies had business arrangements. The two companies legally challenged the probe multiple times, but the Supreme Court rejected their pleas to put the investigations on hold in 2021. Subsequently in 2022, the CCI conducted raids at the offices of the sellers of Amazon India and Flipkart. At the time, the CCI investigators reportedly collected emails, documents and data from computers at these premises. The report comes close on the heels of union commerce minister Piyush Goyal lashing out at Amazon India over \u201cpredatory pricing policies\u201d last month. Noting that the ecommerce major\u2019s plans to invest billions of dollars in India were only to offset its losses, Goyal said that the funds were not \u201ccoming for any great service\u201d. However, right afterwards, he clarified that the government is not against online marketplaces but wants them to operate fairly. With this, Amazon India and Flipkart have become the latest companies to come under the radar of antitrust authorities. While Google has had to pay hefty fines and undertake sweeping changes to its India operations in response to CCI\u2019s crackdown, Apple too has been pulled up by authorities for abusing its dominance in the app marketplace segment.\u00a0",

The infusion also aligns Proparco\u2019s key pillars in India, reducing inequality and adapting to climate change, according to a statement. Founded in 2011 by Mark Kahn and Jinesh Shah, Omnivore funds Indian startups in agritech and food systems. The VC firm has backed more than 40 startups, including DeHaat, Arya, Stellapps, Reshamandi, Ecozen, Aquaconnect and Pixxel. Meanwhile, Proparco is a private sector financing subsidiary of AFD Group. It provides funding and support to both businesses and financial institutions in Africa, Middle East Asia and Latin America. \u201cOmnivore empowers entrepreneurs revolutionising agriculture, rural economies, and climate solutions. Proparco\u2019s support will help these innovations scale globally, fostering resilient and equitable communities worldwide,\u201d said Jinesh Shah, managing partner of Omnivore. \u201cThis project is perfectly in line with our three strategic objectives in favour of a sustainable and resilient economy, for the protection of the planet and for the reduction of inequalities. By committing to climate-friendly investments that empower small-scale farmers to strengthen their resilience, Omnivore is pivotal in supporting sustainable development in India,\u201d said Diane Jegam, South-Asia director of Proparco.\u00a0 Omnivore announced the first close of its third fund at  $150 Mn in June 2023 . Its portfolio companies have shown progress in 2024. Sid\u2019s Farm, a dairy brand,  raised $10 Mn  in June.  DeHaat expanded  its services to new regions, while Arya launched fintech solutions for farmers. The agritech and climate tech sectors in India have seen increased activity. In the agritech space, Superplum, a fruit supply chain company, raised  $15 Mn in a Series A  round in May, while ONO raised  INR 11 Cr in seed funding  in April. On the climate tech front,  Varaha, an environmental consulting startup , secured $8.7 Mn in funding in February. India\u2019s climate-tech sector attracted $2,853 million in investments by November 30, 2023, according to the FSG report.",

        "Article Content": "A decade ago, Flipkart transformed India\u2019s shopping landscape with the launch of its flagship Big Billion Day Sale, quickly followed by Amazon\u2019s Great Indian Festival in 2015. These two sales fundamentally transformed the festive season economy, steering consumers away from traditional brick-and-mortar stores and toward the convenience of online shopping. What began as a trend has now become a phenomenon, with ecommerce platforms offering irresistible deals and discounts. In just the first week of last year\u2019s festive season, ecommerce platforms recorded an impressive  19% year-on-year (YoY) rise in gross merchandise value (GMV) to INR 47,000 Cr . However, with growing competition from quick commerce platforms, what will this year\u2019s festive season sales look like? Once doubted for their sustainability and relevance beyond metro cities, these platforms have proven the naysayers wrong, witnessing rapid growth over the past year. Now, industry experts predict that these platforms will take a significant portion of the festive season market, cutting into the market share of traditional ecommerce platforms. As far as Karan Taurani\u2019s, SVP of Elara Capital, anticipation goes, a significant portion of consumption, including purchases typically made at local kirana stores, will shift to quick commerce. \u201cThis is because customers today prefer the convenience of having products delivered rather than going out to buy them, especially given traffic constraints and the time and effort involved in shopping during the festive season,\u201d Taurani said. It is on the back of this convenience-led shopping that he sees same-store sales (SSG) growing by around 40-50%, with an additional 20-40% growth from new store openings. Overall, as per Taurani, the industry could see a growth rate of 70-80% this quarter. While speaking with industry experts, we learnt that the demand for convenient, on-demand shopping solutions is at an all-time high. According to Sudeep Sen, VP of GI Group Holding, the Indian customer today seeks instant gratification, which means they expect everything to happen as quickly as possible. Quick commerce platforms initially introduced the habit of delivering groceries within 10-20 minutes, but they have since expanded their offerings to include beauty and personal care, home decor, gifting, electronics, and toys. This diversification is expected to significantly boost their performance during the festive season. Furthermore, the Indian quick commerce platforms also seem to be excelling at analysing customer purchasing behaviour. This has allowed these platforms to tailor their product offerings and shopping experience to meet the growing demand for convenience shopping, an industry analyst said. The expert added that these platforms have evolved to capitalise on key moments, delivering exactly what consumers want. For example, many quick commerce platforms have reported record sales on occasions like the Cricket World Cup Final, New Year\u2019s Eve, Valentine\u2019s Day, and Raksha Bandhan. Although groceries currently account for the largest share of orders on quick commerce platforms, categories like home decor, gifting, and pooja essentials are expected to gain more traction during the upcoming festive season. Taurani observed that each festival sees an uptick in sales of specific categories. For example, apparel does well around the Onam season, while FMCG products, especially in the gifting segment, see a boost during Diwali. \u201cGifting, in particular, has become a major focus for quick commerce platforms. Products like flowers and other niche categories are also gaining traction during festive periods, contributing to the overall growth of these platforms,\u201d he said, adding that items like sweets, chocolates, and even cold drinks see increased sales due to more social gatherings during the festive period. Echoing the sentiment, Sen said that apart from perishable goods, like fruits, vegetables, and milk, food items with slightly longer shelf life also see high levels of engagement and shopping activity on these platforms, especially during the festive season. During Ganesh Chaturthi, for instance, quick commerce platforms dedicated special sections for pooja items, decorations, prasad, and gifts. Many even included Ganesha idols as part of their offerings. A day before Ganesh Chaturthi, Zepto cofounder Aadit Palicha shared that the platform delivered over 4,000 Ganesh idols. In addition, 530 modak molds were being sold per hour on Zepto, surpassing the sales of ready-made  modaks . Similarly, Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto reported a significant surge in demand for festive essentials like rakhis, sweets, snacks, and gifts during Raksha Bandhan this year. Pertinent to mention that quick commerce platforms have also expanded their offerings to include high-ticket items like electronics. Earlier this year, Blinkit even launched PlayStation 5 on its platform. However, according to the founder of a D2C wearables brand, the sale of smartphones and other expensive items is more of a marketing gimmick than a scalable business model. Meanwhile, the surge in festive orders is expected to boost the demand for labour, with workforce needs projected to increase by 25 to 30%. Consequently, large companies are responding to this need by hiring more staff and implementing \u201cscale-up training\u201d programmes to enhance productivity and manage increased volumes. According to Sen, there are two key aspects of the festive season \u2014 while many focus on delivery personnel, the crucial behind-the-scenes roles, like order processing, are often overlooked. \u201cThese tasks require substantial staffing increases, even though these workers are not customer-facing. With the potential for refunds or refusals in every order, extra customer care executives are needed. Additional personnel are also required for mid-mile delivery and sorting products in warehouses,\u201d Sen said. This season, many new players have entered the Indian quick commerce sector. While  Zepto, Blinkit, and Swiggy Instamart  have firmly established themselves in the quick commerce segment, a brigade of new players, including Flipkart Minutes, JioMart, and BigBasket, are looking to dethrone the existing dominance in the Indian quick commerce realm. Notably, Flipkart has recently introduced its quick delivery service, Flipkart Minutes, and BigBasket is transitioning to a full quick delivery model. Meanwhile, Reliance Retail has also begun piloting an immediate delivery service for groceries and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) in select areas of Mumbai and Navi Mumbai. Then there are players like FroGo, which focus on providing 30 to 90-minute deliveries, creating a niche in the ecommerce market that fosters 10 to 20-minute, next-day, or 2-3 day delivery options. However, per sectoral experts, the key competitive advantage of quick commerce platforms will rest in their ability to offer faster delivery compared to traditional ecommerce. For now, the upcoming festive season will be a crucial test for many players to prove their viability in a world where delivery times are shrinking and the list of consumer demands is getting longer.

        "Article Content": "With the festive season just around the corner, Amazon India said it has created more than 1.1 Lakh seasonal \u201cjob opportunities\u201d in the country.\u00a0 In a statement on Thursday (September 12), the ecommerce major said that direct and indirect jobs have been created in Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Chennai, among others.\u00a0 As part of the hiring spree, the company claimed to have hired \u201cthousands of women associates\u201d and an additional 1,900 persons with disabilities. \u201cWe are committed to providing customers across every serviceable pincode in India with fast and reliable deliveries this festive season. To meet this goal, we have hired over 1.1 Lakh additional people to strengthen our fulfilment and logistics network and ensure we can handle the increased demand seamlessly\u2026,\u201d said Abhinav Singh, vice-president of operations at Amazon India. Commenting on the development, union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya said, \u201cAmazon\u2019s commitment to create over 1 Lakh seasonal employment opportunities across India is a commendable step towards bolstering the nation\u2019s workforce during the festive period\u2026\u201d. Meanwhile, as per a report, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has found Amazon India, along with Flipkart, guilty of flouting antitrust regulations and pushing certain listings and sellers. However, this is not the first time that Amazon India has landed in the crosshairs of regulators. Earlier this year, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) took suo motu cognisance of a news report that detailed allegations of labour law violations at Amazon India\u2019s warehouse in Manesar.\u00a0 The report, citing factory workers, claimed that female employees were made to stand duty for nine hours a day, and added that there were no restroom facilities available for women employees at the Manesar unit. Another worker reportedly claimed that he was asked to take a pledge that he would not take toilet or water breaks till the unloading of packages from six trucks was completed. Subsequently, the ecommerce major acknowledged lapses in workplace safety at the warehouse and said that it would take immediate corrective measures to fix the issues. Meanwhile, the ecommerce giant has onboarded employees as it gears for the upcoming festive season, during which ecommerce firms witness a major uptick in online sales. However, with the rising popularity of quick commerce, Amazon will not only compete with the likes of Flipkart and Meesho but also  Swiggy Instamart, Zomato-owned Blinkit, and Zepto this festive season . Amazon India claims to have 1.4 Mn sellers on its platform and operates multiple fulfilment centres spanning 15 states and 43 Mn cubic feet of storage.",

        "Article Content": "Amid a broader rally in D2C unicorn Honasa Consumer\u2019s share prices, investors Peak XV Partners, Fireside Ventures, Stellaris Venture Partners, among others, sold its shares worth INR 1,601.68 Cr via bulk deals.\u00a0 While Peak XV (formerly Sequoia India) sold 1.23 Cr shares worth INR 610.98 Cr, Sequoia Capital Global offloaded 28.71 Lakh shares worth INR 142.12 Cr.\u00a0 Fireside Ventures sold 65.83 Lakh shares for INR 326.05 Cr, while Sofina and Stellaris dumped shares worth INR 297.79 Cr and INR 224.74 Cr, respectively.\u00a0 The shares that flooded the market were lapped up by Morgan Stanley and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company. While Morgan Stanley Asia Singapore Pte bought 24.17 Lakh shares for INR 119.67 Cr, ICICI Prudential bought 28.78 Lakh shares for INR 142.49 Cr.\u00a0 The bulk deals come at a time when the shares of the Varun and Ghazal Alagh-led company are on a bull run. The stock has been seeing an  upward movement  since the company disclosed its financial numbers for the first quarter of financial year 2024-25 (Q1 FY25). The startup\u2019s  profit after tax jumped 62.9%  to INR 40.2 Cr during the quarter from INR 24.7 Cr in the same quarter of previous year on the back of increase in the sales of its beauty products. Operating revenue grew 19.3% on a year-on-year (YoY) basis to INR 554 Cr in the reported quarter. Meanwhile, brokerages have been  bullish on Honasa\u2019s house of brands strateg y. Earlier in July, Emkay gave the company a price target of INR 525 by June 2025.\u00a0 \u201cOur ground checks suggest faster scale up of new brands like The Derma Co and Aqualogica. We foresee a distribution shift in the top-50 towns aiding the  Mamaearth  brand, where repeats are ensuring. We expect enhanced profitability in hero SKUs, where Honasa is likely to reduce trade margin, given healthy repeats,\u201d it said. After touching a record high of INR 546.5 earlier in the week, the shares of the startup slumped 5.48% on the BSE on Thursday (September 12) amid the bulk deals and closed the session at INR 493.40 apiece. At the end of the trading on Thursday, the market cap of the D2C unicorn stood INR 16,026 Cr (about $1.90 Bn).",

        "Article Content": "Just over three months after signing a letter of intent to join the government-backed Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), online travel aggregator  Easemytrip  has now rolled out a marketplace, ScanMyTrip.com, to offer travel services on the network. With this, EaseMyTrip also became the first OTA to both offer and purchase travel services via ONDC, the company said in a statement. It further said that ScanMyTrip will serve as a platform where OTAs, MSMEs, travel agents and homestays can list services such as flights, hotels and accommodations on the network, expanding their reach within the digital marketplace. EaseMyTrip added that its partnership with ONDC will benefit businesses in the travel and tourism sector from the digital infrastructure provided by the network. Additionally, ScanMyTrip simplifies the onboarding process, making it easier for businesses to connect with travellers and compete in the online marketplace, the company further said in a statement. In May, EaseMyTrip, along with a few other Indian unicorns such as OfBusiness, Zerodha, PhysicsWallah,  signed  a letter of intent to join ONDC. This development comes at a time when EaseMyTrip has been consistently taking efforts to expand its footprint into wider markets and various other business sectors. For instance, the online travel agency incorporated a wholly owned  subsidiary  Easy Green Mobility to manufacture ebuses and operate via EaseMyTrip\u2019s other subsidiary YoloBus, in September. Additionally, the company also  acquired  a 4.94% stake in ETrav Tech Limited, which is expected to diversify the startup\u2019s service portfolio and enhance its offerings for corporate clients. Earlier this year, EaseMyTrip announced its foray into the  insurtech  sector with the launch of its new insurance arm, called EaseMyTrip Insurance Broker to offer insurance brokerage services to Indian customers. In 2023, the traveltech major  acquired  a non-controlling stake of about 13% in Eco Hotels and Resorts Ltd in a share swap deal to enter the hotel and hospitality industry. Also, EaseMyTrip cofounder Prashant Pitti was considering to  launch  its co-lending platform and NBFC to serve the underserved MSME market. Rikant Pittie, cofounder of EaseMyTrip said, \u201cBy integrating ScanMyTrip.com with ONDC  Network, we are ensuring that every travel service provider in the ecosystem, from homestays to MSMEs, has the opportunity to thrive in a competitive digital market.\u201d \u201cOur goal is to provide access to advanced digital tools for businesses of all sizes, helping them scale and reach new customers,\u201d added Pittie. Recently, the traveltech major  reported  a net profit of INR 33.9 Cr posted in the June quarter (Q1) of the financial year 2024-25 (FY25), compared to 31% YoY from INR 25.9 Cr.\u00a0 Meanwhile, its quarterly revenue zoomed 23% to INR 152.6 Cr, from INR 124 Cr posted in Q1 FY24, boosted by air tickets. Shares of EaseMyTrip closed at INR 41.08 on the BSE, in the intraday trading today (September 12), marking a 1.8% decline compared to the previous close of INR 41.83.",

        "Author URL": "https://inc42.com/author/akshit-pushkarna/",
        "Article Content": "Logistics major  Delhivery  alleged that its rival Ecom Express used incorrect information about the former multiple times in its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Delhivery made these allegations in an investor presentation under a section titled \u201cBenchmarking in Peer DRHP\u201d. While Delhivery didn\u2019t name Ecom Express, it was clear from the numbers it provided that it was referring to Ecom Express. As per Ecom Express\u2019 DRHP, its shipment count stood at 514.41 Mn in the financial year 2023-24 (FY24) compared to Delhivery\u2019s 740 Mn. However, Delhivery alleged that the shipments of Ecom Express stood at about 450 Mn when adjusted for return to origin (RTO) shipments. The listed logistics major said while it counts forward leg (movement of goods from the manufacturer to the customer) and undelivered or RTO leg as one shipment, Ecom Express counts it as two shipments. Considering the RTO industry average of 14-18%, Delhivery estimated that Ecom Express\u2019 shipments stood at about 450 Mn in FY24. \u201cShipment volume used in the denominator of CPS (cost per shipment) calculation is not like-to-like \u2013 peer likely double-counts RTO shipments, thereby overstating volumes and understating CPS. Peer\u2019s CPS will increase by INR 7 (about 15%) when adjusted for shipment volumes comparable to Delhivery,\u201d the startup alleged. As per Ecom Express\u2019 DRHP, its CPS reduced to INR 39.65 in FY24 from INR 45.40 in FY23 and INR 47.33 in FY22.\u00a0 Delhivery also said that \u2018service EBITDA\u2019 and \u2018corporate costs\u2019 comparisons made in Ecom Express\u2019 DRHP are not necessarily correct due to lack of clarity on \u201cconsistent definition\u201d of \u201ccorporate costs\u201d. Further, it said that CPS comparison is \u201cproblematic on several counts\u201d. It said that per shipment metrics vary depending on shipment\u2019s weight. Hence, Delhivery and Ecom Express\u2019 CPS will be different due to different client mix.\u00a0 \u201cPeer has top customer concentration of 52% of revenue (vs. 16% for Delhivery) resulting in Delhivery\u2019s avg weight per parcel being ~2x of the peer,\u201d it said. Interestingly, Delhivery also pointed out its reach within the country in its investor presentation. With this, it subtly pointed out another inaccuracy in Ecom Express\u2019 DRHP. \u201cDelhivery delivers pan India and covered 18,793 pin codes as of March 31, 2024. As per Government of India, there are 19,300 unique pin codes in India,\u201d it said. Meanwhile, Ecom Express said in its DRHP that as per MapMyIndia it serves over 27,000 pin codes covering about 97% of the population. \u201cThis extensive coverage enables Ecom Express to serve over 25,000 tier 2+ pin codes in FY 2024, positioning it uniquely to capitalise on the growing B2C ecommerce GMV from these regions,\u201d the DRHP read. Inc42 has reached out to Ecom Express for its comments on Delhivery\u2019s allegations. The story will be updated on receiving a response.\u00a0 The development comes almost a month after Ecom Express filed its draft papers for up to INR 2,600 Cr IPO. The startup  filed its DRHP on August 16  for an IPO which will comprise a fresh issue of INR 1,284.5 Cr and an offer for sale component of INR 1,315.5 Cr.\u00a0 Ecom Express plans to use the IPO proceeds to set up new processing centres with automation and new fulfilment machineries (estimated investment of INR 387.44 Cr), invest in IT equipment (INR 73.71 Cr), and strengthen its cloud infrastructure (INR 239.23 Cr).\u00a0 Ecom Express primarily competes with Delhivery, Bluedart, Xpressbees, Shadowfax in the B2C ecommerce express deliveries segment in India. While it mentions that Delhivery commands the most revenue in the market, it also said that it trails Blue Dart in terms of net income.\u00a0 It is heading into the public market at a time when it continues to be a loss-making entity. Its consolidated net loss stood at  I NR 255.8 Cr in FY24, down 67%  from INR 428.1 Cr in FY23. Meanwhile, revenue from operations saw a marginal 2.15% increase to INR 2,609 Cr in FY24 from INR 2,553.9 Cr in the previous fiscal year.",

        "Article Content": "Adtech startup InMobi has secured $100 Mn (around INR 840 Cr) in debt funding from Mars Growth Capital, a joint venture between MUFG and Liquidity Group, as India\u2019s first unicorn prepares for its initial public offering (IPO). The SoftBank-backed startup plans to deploy the fresh capital towards strengthening its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and potential AI-focused acquisitions. Founded in 2007 by Naveen Tewari, Piyush Shah, Mohit Saxena and Abhay Singhal, InMobi provides marketing and monetisation technology to app developers worldwide. In 2019, it diversified from its core adtech business with Glance, an AI-based unicorn startup that operates an Android lockscreen platform. InMobi\u2019s  subsidiary, Roposo, is also transitioning  from an influencer-led commerce model to a broader social commerce platform. The new model will allow users to set up their own stores and leverage GenAI tools to sell products online. Commenting on the funding, InMobi CEO Tewari said, \u201cAI is the bedrock of both InMobi\u2019s consumer and enterprise businesses, and we are using it to power the revolutionary lock screen experiences and InMobi Advertising\u2019s platforms. We are reimagining how ads can be made truly native by driving superior engagement and outcomes for consumers, advertisers and publishers.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to have the confidence and funding from MARS Growth Capital to further accelerate our growth trajectory,\u201d Tewari added. The funding comes at a time when InMobi is gearing up for its public listing. The 17-year old company plans to file its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with market regulator SEBI this year or next year for a public listing in 2025-26. It was earlier reported that InMobi was   eyeing a $10 Bn valuation for its IPO  and expects to clock a revenue of $700 Mn by the end of March. It is pertinent to note that InMobi earns 70-80% of its revenue from North America. In the run up to its IPO, InMobi is planning to shift its domicile back to India from Singapore. According to Inc42 data, InMobi has raised $320.1 Mn in funding till date and counts Sherpalo Ventures, SoftBank Vision Fund and Kleiner Perkins among its investors. It competes with giants like Google, Meta, Yahoo in the adtech market. In India, it competes with Dailyhunt parent VerSe and Crackle among others. The Indian ad tech market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 25.7% from 2024 to 2030, as per a report by Grand View Research.",

        "Article Content": "Sportswear and athleisure startup  Agilitas Sports  has raised funding from Mumbai-based Spring Marketing Capital. However, the startup declined to disclose the funding amount or the valuation. Agilitas will use the fresh funds to expand its brand portfolio, strengthen its presence in India and enter international markets.\u00a0 Founded in 2023, by former Puma executives Abhishek Ganguly, Atul Bajaj and Amit Prabhu, Agilitas is building an entire value chain from manufacturing to retail for sports footwear. It has  raised INR 537 Cr in funding till date  from the likes of Convergent Finance and Nexus Venture Partners. In April this year, the Bengaluru-based startup  bagged exclusive rights for Italian sports brand Lotto . Agilitas plans to design, manufacture and sell Lotto products in categories such as footwear, apparel, accessories, and sports equipment in India, Australia and South Africa.\u00a0 The deal with Spring Marketing Capital is particularly significant as Agilitas is eyeing an entry into the consumer space by 2025. Commenting on the funding, Agilitas cofounder and CEO Ganguly said in a statement that the startup is on track with its initial goal of strengthening its core team and scaling up operations and is now looking to further its marketing capabilities with the partnership with Spring Marketing Capital.\u00a0 \u201c\u2026 we are now well placed to build multiple brands with a deep focus on brand-building within our category. Our aim is for a global reach, driven by a commitment to creating meaningful, long-lasting consumer connections,\u201d he added. While Agilitas is yet to make inroads into the consumer space, it forayed into the business-to-business (B2B) space last year with the  acquisition of Mochiko Shoes  \u2014 the largest sports footwear manufacturer in India. Mochiko caters to several big clients, manufacturing shoes for the likes of Adidas, Puma, New Balance, Skechers, Reebok, Asics, Crocs, Decathlon, Clarks and US Polo in the country. Ganguly told Inc42 earlier that Mochiko is poised to attain a market valuation of INR 1,000 Cr by FY25 and he expected this number to double over the next four years. At the heart of Agilitas\u2019 expansion plans is the country\u2019s rapidly growing footwear and athleisure wear market, which is expected to become an INR 1.91 Lakh Cr opportunity by FY28, on the back of rising household disposable income and middle class boom. \u00a0",

The option is currently available in a few localities in Bengaluru.\u00a0 Swiggy Cafe has curated a few beverage options such as coffee, milkshakes, and protein bars from brands like Blue Tokai and The Whole Truth under the new offering. Meanwhile, there are also some snacks and fries available without a brand name. Zepto Cafe, launched in 2022 and currently available in Mumbai, also has a hybrid approach, with a mix of branded pre-made food and non-branded food items.\u00a0 This is Swiggy\u2019s second experiment with quick deliveries of snacks. In early 2023,\u00a0 Swiggy Instamart piloted Instacafe  to deliver pre-made food and snacks along with groceries through its dark stores in certain pockets of Bengaluru.\u00a0 However, the new Cafe option is available under the food delivery option on the Swiggy app and not under Instamart. The new offering seems to be in the pilot stage. An email sent to Swiggy seeking details about Cafe didn\u2019t elicit any response till the time of publishing this story.\u00a0 The development comes at a time when Swiggy is preparing for its IPO. As per a recent report, the food delivery and quick commerce startup plans to get shareholders\u2019 approval to raise INR 5,000 Cr through fresh issuance of shares in its IPO as against previously planned amount of INR 3,750 Cr. Swiggy is also said to be targeting a valuation of $15 Bn for the IPO. It was last valued at $10.7 Bn. Besides, it also continues to be a loss-making entity. Swiggy\u2019s revenue grew 36% year-on-year (YoY) to INR 11,247 Cr in FY24 while net loss narrowed 44% YoY to INR 2,350 Cr.\u00a0 Last week, Inc42 reported that  Swiggy is also piloting a large order flee t in the Delhi NCR region. Besides, the startup also launched several new features on its app recently, including a group ordering option and  \u2018incognito mode\u2019  for private ordering. Pertinent to note that besides Swiggy, Zomato has also tried its hand at quick deliveries of snacks in the past with \u2018Zomato Instant\u2019. Besides,  Swish also launched its 10-minute food delivery service  last month. The startup delivers a range of fast food offerings in 10 to 15 minutes via its app in select locations of Bengaluru.",

        "Article Content": "Electric two-wheeler maker  Ather Energy  has filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with capital markets regulator SEBI to raise more than INR 3,100 Cr through its initial public offering (IPO). The proposed IPO is a combination of fresh issue of equity shares worth INR 3,100 Cr and an offer-for-sale (OFS) of up to 2.2 Cr equity shares with a face value of INR 1 each. Ather Energy also plans to raise INR 620 Cr through a pre-IPO placement. If such placement is undertaken, the amount will be deducted from the total fresh issue size. It was reported earlier that the emobility unicorn is eyeing a valuation of around $2.5 Bn for its IPO. Caladium Investments, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund II, Internet Fund III, 3State Ventures and cofounders Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain are among investors who will offload their shares via OFS.  Meanwhile, automobile giant Hero MotoCorp, the biggest shareholder in Ather Energy with a 37.2% stake, will not sell shares in the IPO. Proceeds to the tune of INR 927.2 Cr from the IPO will be used for phase I of the manufacturing facility that Ather Energy plans to set up in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Maharashtra, to manufacture and assemble electric two-wheelers and batteries, as per the DRHP. The company plans to commence production in a phased manner at the facility by May 2026 with a targeted capacity of 0.5 Mn E2Ws. A portion of the funds raised through the IPO will also be allocated towards research and development (R&D), marketing initiatives, infrastructure, production initiative and other general corporate purposes. It is pertinent to note that Ather joined the unicorn club recently after raising INR 600 Cr ($71 Mn) \u00a0from its existing investor National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) at a post-money valuation of\u00a0 $1.3 Bn. Founded in 2013 by Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain, Ather Energy manufactures EV two-wheelers and battery packs and also has its own charging infrastructure. After building its market on its 450 series of escooters, the startup recently launched a family escooter series Rizta and forayed into the smart helmet category. In terms of escooter sales, Ather is the fourth biggest player in the Indian market, behind Ola Electric, TVS Motor, and Bajaj Auto. Ather\u2019s total vehicle registration in August stood at 10,873 units, up almost 52% year-on-year (YoY). As per its DRHP, Ather Energy widened its consolidated net loss by over 22% to INR 1,059.7 Cr in the financial year 2023-24 (FY24) from INR 864.5 Cr in the preceding fiscal year. Revenue from operations also fell 1.5% year-on-year to INR 1753.8 Cr. Ather\u2019s DRHP comes at a time when its competitor Ola Electric has already gone public by raising over INR 6,145.6 Cr through its IPO. The Bhavish Aggarwal-led startup went public at a valuation of $4 Bn. However, the company made a muted stock market debut, with its shares listing at INR 75.99 apiece on the BSE as against its IPO issue price of INR 76. \u00a0 \u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari has said that he doesn\u2019t have any objection to subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs) from the finance and heavy industries ministers. Addressing the 64th ACMA annual session, the minister highlighted how the costs of EVs are expected to align with those of petrol and diesel vehicles in two years, making additional financial incentives redundant.\u00a0 This comes a few days after Gadkari suggested that subsidies to EV makers are no longer needed. He cited reduced prices of lithium ion batteries and the increase in the number of EV manufacturing as the reasons for the same. \u201cInitially costs of manufacturing electric vehicles were high, but as demand has increased, production costs have dropped, making further subsidies unnecessary,\u201d the minister said. \u201cConsumers are now choosing electric and compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles on their own and I do not think we need to provide much subsidy for electric vehicles,\u201d he said, pointing out the lower rate of GST on electric vehicles (5%) compared to petrol and diesel vehicles (28%). Even with the government aiming for EV penetration to reach 30% by 2030, EV adoption for both two- and four-wheelers has rather remained sluggish.\u00a0 On the broader EV adoption front, the cumulative EV sales in India reached 41,35,077 units by the end of FY2024, as per a report by  JMK Research and Analysis.\u00a0 In FY24, the  EV sales surpassed the 1.7 Mn mark with over 55% of the share  coming from registered e2Ws, followed by passenger electric three-wheelers (E3W P) with 32% market share. Total EV two-wheeler registrations also fell to 88,473 units last month from over 1.07 Lakh units registered in July, as per Vahan data as of September 2. However, the registrations rose 41% compared to 62,782 units in August 2023. Amid all these, the government has been introducing several initiatives to boost EV sales. Earlier this year, the Ministry of Heavy Industries introduced the INR 500 Cr EMPS 2024. It is a stopgap scheme aimed at helping the EV industry with demand subsidies following the end of the FAME-II scheme and before the launch of the FAME-III scheme. Moreover, startups in the EV segment are either planning to or have entered the brouses recently. While Ola Electric made its EV debut in August this year, its counterpart Ather Energy is also reported to be gearing up for its IPO.",

        "Article Content": "How often do we see a new sport entering India? The answer is, not very often. It\u2019s because any new sport takes quite a while to establish itself and gain traction to finally create headlines.\u00a0 Similar has been the journey of pickleball in India. For the uninitiated, the sport operates at the intersection of tennis, table tennis, and badminton and is played with a hard plastic wiffle ball on an arena similar to a badminton court (also in dimensions). While the sport (pickleball) originated in Washington in 1965, it was introduced in India in 2008 by Sunil Valavalkar. The sport even has a governing body in India \u2014 The All India Pickleball Association (AIPA). Meanwhile, many may not know the popularity of pickleball has been pivotal in aiding the growth of its distant cousin, Padel, which is also a racket sport but a hybrid of tennis and squash. Padel has been played in India with the formation of the Indian Padel Federation (IPF) and since the set up of  the first padel court in Bengaluru in 2017 . The country today has over 100 padel courts. \n \n While it took several years for pickleball to gain prominence in a nation deeply devoted to cricket, padel achieved the same popularity in just a few years. All in all, Hudle, a sportstech platform, has seen  a 159% increase  in the growth of Pickleball and Padel between 2019 and 2022.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It was precisely the period during which Nikhil Sachdev, Ronak Daftary, and brothers Jigar Doshi and Pratik Doshi pivoted from their original turf and court construction and leasing business to get the most out of the growing popularity of padel, a sport that finds its roots in Mexico. Incorporated in 2020,  Padel Park  aims to foster the sports of padel in the country by building a complete ecosystem around it \u2014 ranging from constructing courts to teaching the sport and organising championships.\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking with Inc42, the cofounders said that the startup, Padel Park, is the by-product of their first interaction with the sport during the pandemic.\u00a0 When the pandemic hit, Sachdev and the Doshi brothers were running Astro Park, a company specialising in developing turfs for futsal and box cricket. Meanwhile, Daftery was in the same field, operating his own business, TurfPark. Sharing a common line of work, the four founders connected and envisioned collaborating on a project when the right opportunity arose. The opportunity came when the Astro Park team sought to build a sports booking app to boost their revenues. However, their plans came to a standstill when both turf businesses were forced to shut down during the government-imposed lockdown. As they looked for ways to stay in the sports business post-pandemic, Sachdev and his team began exploring the global landscape of turf-based sports. At the time, padel tennis was making waves in Europe, attracting a lot of attention from both athletes and celebrities. Once the founders experienced the game themselves and were captivated by it, their plans for a booking app were set aside. Their new focus became making padel more accessible to Indians. \u201cWe were intrigued by the ease of the game even though it was just a combination of tennis, squash and badminton. It just made sense for India, as the very social nature of the game was exactly what we needed after being locked up for almost two years,\u201d Sachdev said.\u00a0\u00a0 He added, \u201cIt was also an opportunity, as India had only a few padel courts at the time.\u201d Towards the end of 2022, the cofounder squad started working on constructing their first padel court in Mumbai city.\u00a0\u00a0 In a matter of weeks, the facility was fully booked, and by 2023, Padel Park\u2019s first turf was sitting on a waiting list of more than three weeks. Inspired by the overwhelming reception, especially from Mumbai\u2019s affluent areas, the founders started laying out plans to establish a comprehensive padel ecosystem in India. At the time, Sachdev noticed that there wasn\u2019t much competition in the space, and they could get the first-mover advantage with the sport only if they were able to cover all aspects of the padel sport in the country. Therefore, with a vision to build padel courts, establish an academy for aspiring athletes, and offer self-managed \u201cpay and play\u201d facilities, Padel Park began its journey.\u00a0 This has helped the startup harvest INR 2.5 Cr in FY24 revenues, and the company is EBITDA positive, the cofounder (Sachdev) said. He added that the startup is witnessing a 20% month-on-month (MoM) rise in revenues.\u00a0 One of the early hiccoughs in Padel Park\u2019s journey has been concerns related to its cost. For instance, Padel Magazine UK finds that the average cost of playing the sport is about 33% higher than tennis. \u201cPadel is viewed as a premium sport when compared to other sports. Padel requires special infrastructure, a high-quality turf, and its equipment is also expensive. Hence, there was always a doubt if the game would be a hit in the long term,\u201d Sachdev said.\u00a0\u00a0 But, as luck favours the brave, the founders now run a grid of ten padel courts at four locations in Mumbai, namely Bandra, Malabar Hills, Cooperage, and Worli. In the short term, largely by the end of this year, Padel Park has set its eyes on running a cluster of 35 more courts across India.\u00a0 As of now, about 60% of the startup\u2019s revenue is driven by people booking courts in the city. Sachdev asserts that the 10 courts that are operational in the city see bookings 2-3 weeks in advance. Padel Park\u2019s courts see an average footfall of 5K users per month.\u00a0 Moving on, the company runs a Padel academy, which is headed by a Spanish player, Victor Perez, who brings in over 15 years of experience. Perez, who has joined Padel Park as a full-time technical director, is also in-charge of training other coaches.\u00a0 The training sessions are divided into three categories: beginners, pro, and kids. Coaches can be booked on-site. The startup charges between INR 8,000 and INR 9,000 per month from coaches. However, private lessons cost more. As the business is still in its early stages, training currently accounts for about 10% of the startup\u2019s total revenue. \u201cWe are looking to train over 250 players before the end of the year. Also, we are in the process of creating a player pool in India with participation in an international tournament in September,\u201d Sachdev said.\u00a0 As the startup continues to train more players, the real driver of interest in any sport is spectator attention. According to the founders, for a sport to gain traction, competitive events at the amateur level are crucial to building excitement. With this in mind, the startup has been actively working on creating more IPs for tournaments.\u00a0\u00a0 On the back of the sport\u2019s growing popularity, especially after its first tournament last month, the startup is receiving increasing advertising interest from several new-age, premium brands. Consequently, the events business now contributes around 30% of Padel Park\u2019s overall revenue. \u201cOur last tournament, held on August 24, saw participation from over 88 teams. We\u2019re also attracting more premium brands eager to engage directly with their target audience through these events. For example, luxury vehicle dealership Infinity Cars was our title sponsor for the last tournament. Looking ahead, we\u2019re on track to establish a pan-India league as we continue expanding our court network,\u201d said Sachdev. The cofounders added that several companies, like Fast & Up Reload, Babolai, Plant Power, Stay Vista, Craycol, S Raheja Realty and OG Samosa, have sponsored its events so far. Padel Park is also engaged in the construction, leasing, and selling of Padel courts via its subsidiary, Sky Padel India. Earlier last year, it entered into a joint venture with Sky Padel Spain for manufacturing (in India) and selling high-quality Padel courts in India and Asia to hotels, housing societies, sports clubs, and schools, among others.\u00a0 \u201cWe are manufacturing under the guidance of Sky Padel and hope to cater to orders coming in from around Asia soon. For Padel courts, we engage in building the infrastructure via the procurement of raw materials (steel, glass and lightning) locally. The turfs are still imported but we look to indigenise that process soon,\u201d Sachdev said.\u00a0 Sachdev said that the court segment of the business was what drew JSW Sports\u2019 founder, Parth Jindal, to invest an undisclosed amount in the startup in August.\u00a0\u00a0 Beyond court sales, the cofounders\u2019 ambitious plan to expand its court count to 200 in the next 2-3 years heavily involves franchise-operated centres. On the company\u2019s growth outlook, Sachdev emphasised his interest in exploring non-metro regions of India. He believes that expanding beyond the traditional Tier I cities is more appealing due to lower land costs and a stronger propensity for people in these areas to spend on value-for-money experiences.\u00a0 The cofounder said that the company sees 30% of its franchise inquiries come from such cities, and cities like Chandigarh, Ahmedabad, Kochi, Surat, and Jaipur are already on their radar.\u00a0 While the sport has gained some traction in the country, Sachdev remains cautious due to the fast-paced nature of trends, which could change overnight. For now, as per Sachdev, a major hurdle for padel\u2019s growth in the country is gaining recognition from the government, which he believes will be pivotal for driving the adoption of this sport.\u00a0\u00a0 Once padel is recognised as an amateur sport, the startup anticipates schools and other sports facilities upgrading their infrastructure to include padel courts. Though recent trends have provided a tailwind for the startup, it remains uncertain whether padel will evolve beyond a fad and achieve widespread popularity across India.

        "Author URL": "https://inc42.com/author/tapanjana-rudra/",
        "Article Content": "In the last one year, the EV sector in India has faced significant challenges on the subsidy front. The  reduction in subsidies has hurt many electric two-wheeler companies  and slowed down the overall EV adoption in the country. While it\u2019s debatable if it was the government\u2019s ambiguity while issuing subsidies or the EV makers\u2019 failure to comply with the localisation norms, the country needs to come out of this turmoil at the earliest to lead the global EV revolution. Nevertheless, this upheaval might be leading to a new phase in vehicle electrification for the country. For starters, talks around the importance of EV financing have started getting increased focus, and new startups are entering this space to ensure a seamless adoption of EVs, especially for commercial use cases.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the sector is also making noteworthy improvements in battery technology, faster charging, and solutions for B2B needs like last-mile delivery have been driving adoption \u2014 all thanks to the electrification happening at a mass scale. As of now, with FAME-III yet to be announced and industry leaders already standing divided on the need for subsidies, it is vital to note that demand subsidies have played a crucial role in giving a boost to the country\u2019s EV adoption journey. To get better clarity into the current state of the Indian EV space on World EV Day, we spoke with Kunal Khattar, founding partner, AdvantEdge, a mobility-focussed early-stage VC firm. It has also backed EV startups, including Exponent Energy, Baaz Bikes, Park+, and Electrifi Mobility. Not to mention, Khattar helped us decode the current challenges, complexities, and opportunities for the Indian EV industry. Notably, the industry leader believes that 100% EV adoption is inevitable because of the rising costs of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and the deflationary nature of EVs.\u00a0 However, while the 100% EV adoption dream currently feels far-fetched, where do we stand on the global pulpit? What kind of gaps need to be plugged in at the earliest? And most importantly, will subsidising users really help the Indian EV ecosystem in the long run? If not, then what will?\u00a0\u00a0 Here are the edited excerpts\u2026 Inc42: As one of the top investors in the EV industry, how do you see the sector right now? Has some of the initial excitement died down? How are you assessing the current progress within the EV ecosystem? Kunal Khattar:  People have largely focussed on personal mobility, like Ather and Ola Electric, Tata Motors, MG, or BYDs. I think personal mobility (personal vehicles), or electrification of personal form factors, has always received more media attention because the readers are often potential customers. Now, with the FAME subsidy reducing dramatically, the numbers are fluctuating, and we are witnessing inconsistent growth. As a fund, we have always believed that as EV adoption happens at a mass scale, the transition from ICE to EV will happen faster in B2B or commercial areas than personal mobility.\u00a0 Our thesis is simple \u2014 let\u2019s electrify the 10% commercial B2B vehicles, as it will save the largest portion of the $140-$150 Bn a year spent on importing crude oil. To share an interesting data point, in India, we have about 380 Mn-400 Mn vehicles on the road. Of these, only 10% are commercial B2B form factors. However, they consume 70% of the country\u2019s total energy. This category includes public transportation, vehicles used in logistics, last-mile deliveries, food delivery, quick commerce, trucks, and intercity buses, among others.\u00a0 Unlike personal EVs where the payback period in comparison to the cost paid upfront is higher, EVs are 30%-40% cheaper for B2B commercial use cases from day one. However, when I speak to the likes of Uber, Ola, Amazon or Flipkart, they say that they want to be 100% electric. But the issue is that there is no solid energy solution. The vehicles available are either low-speed food deliveries or too high-end. And then there is the challenge of high financing and insurance costs. So, we are currently hearing about all of these missing pieces that are preventing an accelerated adoption of EVs for commercial B2B use. That\u2019s the area we are broadly focussing on. The good part is that the change in this direction is happening but this is not an aspect the mass is interested in. Inc42: When you talk about these form factors that are missing, how do you think the existing players in the market \u2013 be it in battery or vehicle manufacturing \u2014 can play a role? Kunal Khattar:  Let\u2019s break it down into three to four categories. If I start with three-wheelers, it\u2019s largely a 100% B2B use case. Since it\u2019s already 100% B2B, if you electrify it, it meets the needs of the end users. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve seen companies like Euler, Altigreen and Omega Seiki Mobility come up fast. Now, the legacy guys are catching up. The Murugappa group is coming, Mahindra and Bajaj are entering this category. Hero MotoCorp is trying to enter the space by investing in Altigreen. In the two-wheeler category, a majority of the funding and capital has gone towards consumer-focussed players like Ather and Ola Electric, and TVS. Very little capital has gone to companies that are solving for commercial use cases. Hence, a majority of the vehicles in the B2B space are typically Completely Knocked Down (CKD) kits coming from China and being assembled here in India.\u00a0 In fact, many players solving for logistics did this as they wanted the cheapest options available but these vehicles fail to function well as per Indian conditions, including roads, infrastructure, and temperature, etc. That\u2019s where the likes of Yulu and Baaz have become the leaders in building local two-wheelers for last-mile delivery and logistics. However, these vehicles in commercial use cases require swapping or rapid charging solutions. Now, the battery-swapping technology that Sun Mobility or Baaz are providing is solving this problem to an extent. Meanwhile, Exponent Energy\u2019s 15-minute charging is a game changer for three-wheeler cargos.\u00a0 Coming to ebuses, the rapid adoption of EVs has mostly been at airports. For bus companies, like ZingBus or FreshBus, that need to ply their vehicles 600-800 km a day for intercity travel, it isn\u2019t feasible if the buses take six hours to charge after every 300 km. This is where  Exponent has now come up with 15-minute charging for ebuses . In the electric car category, while players like BluSmart and Everest have emerged, the problem is they use EVs made by traditional OEMs like Tata Motors, which are made for consumer use cases, or are retrofitting traditional ICE vehicles to electric. So, we need players who would build EVs only for BluSmart or Everest. The biggest gap right now is in heavy-duty commercial EVs for long distances. There is a need for strong energy distribution facilities on national highways, which will first be set up to cater to the needs of buses. Once they are set up, you\u2019ll start seeing etrucks joining the fray. Inc42: Does charging infra continue to be a major challenge? How do you think India is doing in terms of charging infrastructure and government policies?\u00a0 Kunal Khattar:  In many Western countries, 70-80% of EV charging is done at home or at work. The challenge with India is that our cities were not planned keeping EVs in mind, and garages at Indian homes are not a common sight.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, our dependence on public charging increases. Also, we don\u2019t see a lot of charging options at work because real estate is too expensive. A way to crack this is to increase battery swapping infra, which takes less space. This is also the reason why is why swapping is becoming increasingly popular among smaller form factors like two-wheelers and three-wheelers. The real breakthrough will happen when an Indian Oil petrol pump has 10 electric charging points, along with diesel, petrol and CNG filling pumps. But I see this happening 20 years from now. As far as the Indian government\u2019s stand on EVs is concerned, it has been very supportive in trying to accelerate the adoption. However, in FAME-I and FAME-II, we\u2019ve roughly seen INR 10,000-12,000 Cr of subsidy given by the government to the overall EV sector, which is around $1.5 Bn. For comparison, China has invested $230 Bn in its EV sector to date. I understand that we have a limited budget, but we also aspire to become world leaders in EVs. Also, we would like to see more subsidies for manufacturing, which is why PLI is the true game changer over FAME which subsidises end consumers. We would like to see the taxpayers\u2019 money going into prioritising the infrastructure before end customers. If you build a robust charging network, infrastructure, build your own battery and cell technology, and set up a manufacturing plant that can manufacture at scale, the cost of EVs will automatically fall. Therefore, I feel that the country needs to prioritise better, and we need a lot more support. Inc42: Do you believe subsidies to end consumers via FAME are not needed anymore, especially since transport minister Nitin Gadkari recently said EV makers no longer need subsidies? Kunal Khattar:  While subsidies at the product level are fine, I believe we need capital inflow to make the manufacturing of EVs more competitive rather than continuously subsidising end users. This means I would like to see the charging infrastructure becoming more competitive, so the government should focus on that and bring down the cost of the hardware required for charging. It should encourage people to set up cell manufacturing plants through PLI, attract more global OEMs, encourage joint ventures, and support large-scale manufacturing funds for critical components like motors and controllers. Subsidies for land and energy will also help. I think investing in infrastructure or B2B players will have more benefits in the long run. Inc42: Are you planning to invest in any EV component makers or ESDM players building solutions, particularly for electric mobility? Kunal Khattar:  EVs require 70%-80% fewer parts than any internal combustion engine. Its four major components are the battery, battery management system (BMS), motor, and controller. The rest of the vehicle, comprising wheels, shock absorbers, and doors,\u00a0 is similar to ICE vehicles. So, the traditional suppliers will continue to be relevant even for EVs.\u00a0 Hence, we are interested in component manufacturing, but the number of products that we need to build is very few. Unless somebody has a proprietary technology that\u2019s mind-blowing, we will not invest. For instance, Exponent has impressed us with its innovative tech. We met almost all startups out there building different components. We are keeping an eye on them for possible investment opportunities.\u00a0 Further, semiconductors for electric mobility hasn\u2019t been our main focus area. However, we are more interested in exploring how AI is going to impact electrification.\u00a0 I think chips, autonomous driving, cell technology, battery warranty, alternate cell chemistries, expanding usage-based insurance, and usage-based finance have the potential to support the AI play in EVs.\u00a0 We keep talking about AI as our smartphones on wheels.\u00a0 So, if AI in smartphones can make smartphones 10x more efficient, we are trying to understand how the technology will make an EV more efficient. In addition to this, we are looking at autonomous vehicles, not necessarily EVs. Also, autonomous tractors make for a very interesting use case. We\u2019re actually in the process of investing in an e-tractor company. Autonomous tractors are also on our radar, but maybe two to three years from now.",

        "Article Content": "IPO-bound electric two-wheeler player Ather Energy\u2019s operating revenue declined 1.5% year-on-year (YoY) to INR 1,753.8 Cr in the financial year 2023-24 (FY24), while net loss widened over 22% to INR 1,059.7 Cr. As per the company\u2019s  DRHP filed with SEBI for more than INR 3,100 Cr IPO , Ather\u2019s top line was hurt by the reduction in FAME subsidy provided by the government. In FY23, Ather\u2019s operating revenue had seen a sharp 335% YoY jump to INR 1,780.9 Cr. In line with the EV startup\u2019s growth, its net loss also widened 2.5X YoY to INR 864.5 Cr. On the reduction in revenue, Ather said in the DRHP, \u201cGovernment of India has in the past recalled and scaled back, and may in the future recall or scale back, the benefits available to EV manufacturers under its schemes, increasing the costs borne by EV manufacturers. For example, pursuant to a notification dated May 19, 2023 from the Ministry of Heavy Industries, Government of India, the cap on incentives for the FAME scheme was scaled back from INR 15,000 per kWh to INR 10,000 per kWh, with effect from June 1, 2023. As a result of the reduced subsidy, our customers faced an increase in the retail price of our E2Ws ranging from INR 20,434 to INR 30,285. This contributed to a slight decrease in our revenue from operations.\u201d\u00a0 Founded in 2013 by Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain, Ather is one of the leading Indian two-wheeler EV manufacturers. It also manufactures its own battery packs and operates its own charging network. After building its market on its 450 series of escooters, which comprises Ather 450S, Ather 450X, and Ather 450 Apex, the startup recently launched a family escooter series Rizta and also forayed into the smart helmet category. Ather\u2019s first model, Ather 450X \u2013 with its three variants \u2013 was the biggest contributor to the revenue in FY24. The total revenue generated by this series of vehicles stood at INR 1,283.8 Cr. In that, Ather 450X with 2.9 kWh capacity contributed 9% to the total operating revenue and Ather 450X with 3.7 kWh capacity contributed 31%. Meanwhile, the startup generated INR 277.7 Cr in revenue from Ather 450S and INR 9.1 Cr from Ather 450 Apex. In FY24, Ather sold 22,712 units of its Ather 450S, 86,315 units of 450X and 550 units of Ather 450 Apex. Ather Rizta\u2019s deliveries began in the current fiscal year, from May 2024.\u00a0 While Ather\u2019s sale of finished goods, comprising its escooters, increased in FY24, the sale of its stock-in-trade, comprising EV-related accessories, spare parts and merchandise plummeted almost 76% YoY. The EV major\u2019s sale of services, which it primarily derives from the sales of Pro Pack, which consists of Atherstack features, three years of access to Ather Connect features and the extended battery warranty, saw almost a 15% YoY decline during the year under review. Ather\u2019s total expenses in FY24 stood at INR 2,674.2 Cr, rising marginally from INR 2,666.3 Cr in the previous year. Cost Of Materials Consumed:  The EV OEM spent the largest portion of its total expenses under this head, which increased 2.7% YoY to INR 1,579.2 Cr in FY24. It comprised raw materials and components Ather buys from its vendors for use in the manufacturing of scooters. Besides, it outsources manufacturing of components like chassis, battery management system (BMS), vehicle control unit, motor controller, and raw materials. Employee Cost:  Ather\u2019s total employee benefit expenses rose 10.3% to INR 369.2 Cr in FY24 from INR 334.8 Cr in the previous year. The company had 1,458 on-roll employees and 996 off-roll employees as on March 31, 2024. Advertisement & Marketing:  Ather\u2019s expenses under this bucket declined a massive 55% to INR 90.7 Cr during the year under review from INR 203.8 Cr in FY23. The startup said that this reduction in marketing efforts was mainly done to optimise  marketing spends, foreseeing a slowdown in consumer demand given the reduction of regulatory incentives under FAME-II. R&D Expenses:  Ather\u2019s expenditure here increased to INR 236.5 Cr in FY24 from INR 191.6 Cr in the previous fiscal year. As per Ather\u2019s DRHP submitted on Monday (September 9), its IPO will comprise INR 3,100 Cr worth of fresh issue and an OFS component of 2.2 Cr equity shares. Cofounders Mehta and Jain will be offloading 10 Lakh shares each as part of the OFS. Among the other selling shareholders are Caladium Investments, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund II, and Tiger Global\u2019s Internet Fund III. Hero MotoCorp, the biggest shareholder in Ather, will not sell any stake in the IPO. Ather\u2019s IPO comes on the heels of its competitor Ola Electric going public by raising over INR 6,145.6 Cr in total.\u00a0 Like Ola, Ather is also going public as a loss-making entity with no clear path projected to profitability.\u00a0 In fact, the recently turned unicorn said in its DRHP that its ability to achieve profitability, positive cash flows from operating activities and a net working capital surplus will depend on factors like cost control, increasing sales of escooters in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka and any other international markets. Recently, Ather expanded its business to Sri Lanka, marking its second overseas foray after Nepal. \u201cWe cannot assure you that our expansion into international markets will be profitable, nor can we guarantee that our products can be sold at favourable margins,\u201d the EV major said.",

        "Article Content": "Following Ola Electric\u2019s suit, IPO-bound electric two-wheeler (E2W) manufacturer  Ather Energy  is working on new platforms to foray into the electric motorcycle segment. In its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) filed with SEBI, Ather said it plans to expand its product portfolio with the launch of new vehicles that can cater to the broader E2W market with upgraded software features.\u00a0 \u201cWe are in the process of developing two new E2W platforms that are expected to further improve cost structures and enable us to launch products across a range of scooter and motorcycle segments,\u201d the startup\u2019s DRHP read.\u00a0 As of now, Ather\u2019s portfolio comprises seven electric scooters \u2013 Ather 450X (2.9 kWh), Ather 450X (3.7 kWh), Ather 450S, Ather 450 Apex, Ather Rizta S, Ather Rizta Z (2.9 kWh) and Ather Rizta Z (3.7 kWh).\u00a0 The variants of Ather 450X brought in the highest revenue for Ather in the financial year 2023-24 (FY24). Ather 450X contributed INR 590.5 Cr to the revenue. Revenue from Ather 450X with 2.9 kWh capacity stood at INR 157.8 Cr, while that of Ather 450X with 3.7 kWh capacity stood at INR 535.5 Cr. For the fiscal, the EV maker saw its  revenue decline 1.5% year-on-year (YoY)  to INR 1,753.8 Cr. Net loss zoomed over 22% YoY to INR 1,059.7 Cr in FY24.\u00a0 The startup  filed its IPO papers  earlier in the day and is looking to raise INR 3,100 Cr via a fresh issue of shares. The public issue will also comprise an offer-for-sale (OFS) of up to 2.2 Cr equity shares. Ather will use the IPO proceeds to finance its new factory in Maharashtra. As of now, it operates only one plant in the Hosur district of Tamil Nadu. Besides, the funds will also be used for investment in research and development, marketing initiatives and general corporate purposes.\u00a0 Last month, Ather\u2019s rival Ola Electric unveiled its  electric motorcycle portfolio . Its Roadster portfolio comprises Roadster X, Roadster, and Roadster Pro bikes. The deliveries of the motorcycles will commence from Q4 FY25. With the entry of Ola Electric and the proposed entry of Ather Energy, the competition in India\u2019s electric bike segment will intensify further. As of now, the segment is populated by the likes of Revolt, Pure EV, among others.\u00a0 According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the Indian ebike market is projected to grow to a size of $60.9 Mn by 2029, clocking a CAGR of 17.7% from $27 Mn in 2024.",

        "Article Content": "Tata Group-owned Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is reportedly working with group peer Tata Electronics to roll out first made-in-India chips by 2026. As per Mint\u2019s report, citing Sreenivasa Chakravarti, vice-president and global head of TCS\u2019 digital engineering business, TCS has numerous \u2018touch points\u2019 with chip fabrication where Tata Electronics has taken the lead. Inc42 has reached out to Chakravarti for comments on the development. The story will be updated based on his response. \u201cWe are part of the same group as Tata Electronics, and there are leverage points that we are working on together. The two companies sit at different parts of the value chain, so we are leveraging our core expertise in what we excel at for this,\u201d Chakravarti was quoted as saying in the report. This follows the approval of the country\u2019s first  semiconductor fab , in February, to be set up by the Tata Group in partnership with Taiwan\u2019s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (PSMC). Tata Semiconductor Assembly and Test Pvt Ltd (TSAT) set up a chip assembly and testing unit in Assam, alongside the first  semiconductor chip  from the new plant being built in partnership with Taiwan\u2019s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (PSMC) in Gujarat\u2019s Dholera which will be out by the end of 2026. On this note, Tata Electronics has been building partnerships with various companies and countries abroad for semiconductor chips through the year. For instance, Tesla has  inked  a strategic agreement with Tata Electronics to acquire semiconductor chips for its global operations, in April. Also, Tata Electronics has  signed  a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL) for semiconductor equipment infrastructure, a few days ago.\u00a0 The first chip from Assam will roll out by late 2025 or early 2026, according to the group, serving sectors including automotive, power, electronics, consumer and medical, based on the report. \u201cWe see so many companies come to India and set up shop here in order to build technologies and services for global markets, but there is an addressable market for semiconductors in India as well,\u201d the report quoted Chakravarti as saying. \u201cThe challenge, therefore, is to build for India, from within India.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "Transport minister Nitin Gadkari has said that annual electric vehicle (EV) sales in India will touch the 1 Cr mark by 2030.\u00a0 Gadkari also said that the boom in EV sales will create 5 Cr jobs in the country by the end of this decade, PTI reported. He added that the homegrown EV market will become an INR 20 Lakh Cr opportunity by 2030.\u00a0 Addressing the annual convention of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) on Tuesday (September 10), the minister also estimated that the Indian EV finance market will balloon to a size of INR 4 Lakh Cr in the next six years.\u00a0 Expressing hope that India will become the biggest global automotive manufacturing hub in the future, Gadkari said he expects the cost of lithium-ion batteries to come down further, enabling affordability and fueling mass adoption of EVs.\u00a0 Asserting confidence that Centre\u2019s production linked incentive (PLI) scheme will spur battery cell manufacturing in India, Gadkari said, \u201cIndia will be in a position to export our lithium-ion battery to different parts of the world going forward, as many companies are setting up their cell manufacturing facilities in the country\u201d. Meanwhile, in a written address at the event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called on the Indian automotive industry to build green and clean mobility solutions.\u00a0 \u201cWorking (on) greener and cleaner mobility is a vital step in this direction (country\u2019s progress). It is important that this climate-conscious and sustainable vision resonates with domestic and international partners,\u201d PM Modi said as per PTI.\u00a0 The comments came days after  Gadkari said that there was no need for EV subsidies . He later clarified that he had no objection towards subsidies for EVs from the finance and heavy industries ministers. It must be highlighted that EV sales have largely been on an upswing so far in 2024. After tanking by half month-on-month (MoM) in April, two-wheeler electric vehicle registrations grew 18% MoM in May and 3.3% MoM in June. The numbers further rose 34% MoM in July before  falling 18% MoM in August .\u00a0 Despite headwinds such as high prices, insufficient charging infrastructure and range anxiety among customers, sales of EVs have been on the rise owing to the sops being offered by the Centre and state governments.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the Centre is planning to  roll out the third version of the Faster Adoption & Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles  (FAME) scheme in the coming two months.\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "After months of speculations over the Centre\u2019s plans for the launch of the third iteration of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme, the union cabinet has approved \u2018PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) Scheme\u2019 for the promotion of electric vehicles in the country.\u00a0 PM E-DRIVE, which will effectively replace the FAME scheme, will have an outlay of INR 10,900 Cr for a period of two years. It is pertinent to note that this is higher than the INR 10,000 Cr initial outlay of the FAME- II scheme.\u00a0\u00a0 The new scheme will provide subsidies and demand incentives worth INR 3,679 Cr for electric two-wheelers (E2Ws), three-wheelers (E3Ws), ambulances, trucks and other emerging EVs. With this, the government aims to support 24.79 Lakh E2Ws, 3.16 Lakh E3Ws, and 14,028 ebuses. Under the scheme, the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) will launch e-vouchers for EV buyers to avail demand incentives. \u201c At the time of purchase of the EV, the scheme portal will generate an Aadhaar authenticated e-Voucher for the buyer. A link to download the e- voucher shall be sent to the registered mobile number of the buyer,\u201d a government statement said. Further, the government has earmarked INR 4,391 Cr for the purchase of 14,028 ebuses for public transport agencies. These buses will be deployed in nine cities \u2013 Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad. Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL) will be responsible for the demand aggregation.\u00a0\u00a0 PM E-DRIVE will also boost India\u2019s charging infrastructure by promoting installation of electric vehicle public charging stations (EVPCS). The government is targeting installation of 22,100 fast chargers for E4Ws, 1,800 fast chargers for ebuses and 48,400 fast chargers for E2Ws and E3Ws under the scheme. The budget allocation for the charging infrastructure is INR 2,000 Cr.\u00a0 \u201cThe primary objective of the PM E-DRIVE scheme is to expedite the adoption of EVs by providing upfront incentives for their purchase, as well as by facilitating the establishment of essential charging infrastructure for EVs,\u201d the Centre said.\u00a0 Besides, the scheme also has an outlay of INR 780 Cr for the upgradation of test agencies of MHI with new and emerging technologies. The upgradation of the testing capabilities might be a direct response to the gaps observed in vehicles under the FAME-II. Companies like Hero Electric, Okinawa Autotech, Ampere EV were also  fined for violations  of the norms of the scheme.\u00a0 The announcement comes a few days after it was reported that the government is considering expanding the  outlay for the third rendition  of the FAME scheme to INR 11,000 Cr.\u00a0 FAME-II was approved in 2019 with an outlay of INR 10,000 Cr for a period of three years. However, the deadline was extended by the government from March 31, 2022 to March 31, 2024. Following this, the Centre launched the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) with an allocation of INR 500 Cr as a stop-gap measure to promote EV adoption. Besides the launch of PM E-DRIVE, the union cabinet alson approved the \u2018 PM-eBus Sewa-Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) scheme \u2019 with an outlay of INR 3,435.33 Cr for procurement and operation of ebuses by public transport authorities (PTAs).",

        "Article Content": "The government-run Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) has appointed former chairman of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) R S Sharma as its non-executive chairperson. In his new role, Sharma will help in pacing up the network\u2019s adoption both in domestic and overseas markets. Sharma headed the TRAI from August 2015 to October 2020. \u201cAs the chairperson of ONDC, Sharma\u2019s leadership will be instrumental in driving the organization through its next phase of innovation and expansion. His deep understanding of implementation and ecosystem development in digital public infrastructure will be a cornerstone as ONDC continues to advance its mission and objectives,\u201d ONDC said in a statement. This isn\u2019t the first time that the 1978 IAS batch bureaucrat, Sharma, will be working with ONDC. He has been associated with ONDC since its inception and was a member of the ONDC Advisory Council and the ONDC Technology & Strategy Review Council. Sharma is said to be instrumental in the development and implementation of digital public infrastructure projects like Aadhaar, and CoWIN, among others. With over 40 years of experience, Sharma has held several key roles, including the director general and mission director of UIDAI, CEO of National Health Authority (NHA), secretary of the ministry of electronics and information technology, and the chief secretary for the government of Jharkhand, among others. During his tenure with NHA between February 2021 and January 2023, his leadership was instrumental in leveraging technology to address population-scale challenges in the COVID-19 pandemic. He led the implementation of Ayushman Bharat \u2013 Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) while also initiating the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), the statement added. He also led the design and implementation of the COVID-19 vaccination platform CoWIN. ONDC is an open protocol-based network to enable local commerce across multiple segments, including grocery and mobility among others. It was incorporated in 2021 as an initiative of DPIIT under the aegis of ministry of commerce and industry.\u00a0 The network claims to enable more than 1.2 Cr orders per month and has forayed into categories such as fintech, fashion, electronics in products, and ride-hailing, among others. ONDC claims to have over 6 Lakh sellers live on its network across the country. This comes at the heart of ONDC\u2019s diversifying its offerings and scaling up its presence.\u00a0 Last month, it was reported that ONDC is planning to  launch insurance and mutual fund  products in the coming months.\u00a0 In the same month, the network bolstered its fintech play with the  launch of credit offerings  in just six minutes.\u00a0 ONDC processed 12.5 Mn transactions in August, reflecting a 5% sequential increase. The majority of these transactions were from the mobility category, while the rest came from sectors such as retail purchases and logistics services, among others.",

        "Article Content": "As part of the Centre\u2019s push for promoting electric mobility, the union cabinet has approved the \u2018PM-eBus Sewa-Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) scheme\u2019 with an outlay of INR 3,435.33 Cr for procurement and operation of ebuses by public transport authorities (PTAs). The scheme aims to support the deployment of over 38,000 ebuses during FY25-FY29 period.\u00a0 In a statement, the government said that the scheme will support the operation of ebuses for a period of up to 12 years from the date of deployment. The statement said that a majority of the buses operated by PTAs currently run on diesel/CNG. While ebuses are environmentally friendly and have lower operational costs, the high upfront cost and lower realisation of revenue from operations could make it challenging for PTAs to procure and operate ebuses. \u201cTo address the high capital cost of ebuses, public transport authorities (PTAs) induct these buses through public private partnership on Gross Cost Contract (GCC) model. The PTAs are not required to pay the upfront cost of the bus under the GCC model, instead OEMs/operators procure and operate ebuses for PTAs with monthly payments. However, OEMs/operators are hesitant to engage in this model due to concerns about potential payment defaults,\u201d the statement added.\u00a0 The new scheme aims to address this concern by ensuring timely payments to OEMs/operators through a dedicated fund.\u00a0 In case of any default in payments by the PTAs, the implementing agency, Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL), would make the necessary payments from the funds under the new scheme, which could be later recouped by the PTAs and states and union territories. Besides the PSM scheme, the Cabinet also approved the much-awaited FAME-III scheme, albeit with a different name \u2014 PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) Scheme.\u00a0 The new scheme to boost EV adoption has a total outlay of INR 10,900 Cr. Over the next two years, the scheme aims to support 24.79 Lakh electric two-wheelers, 3.16 Lakh electric three-wheelers, and 14,028 ebuses via demand incentives.\u00a0 Besides, the scheme has also set aside various amounts for the installation of public charging stations, deployment of etrucks and eambulances, among others.",

His comments come at a time when the shares of listed companies in Info Edge\u2019s kitty have surged on the bourses and have grown multifold in the past one year. Speaking during the company\u2019s post-earnings call, Bikhchandani said, \u201cIf we believe there\u2019s substantial growth and consequent value creation left, we think it\u2019s better for long-term value creation for our shareholders. We\u2019ll probably stay. As of now, there is no plan to exit\u201d. Citing his \u201cpast experiences\u201d, he said it is prudent to stay invested for a long time before \u201ctruly\u201d getting the value of one\u2019s bets.\u00a0 \u201cPast experience and evidence tell us that in India, if you enter at an early stage, you need to be patient. When you look at Zomato, we entered in 2010, and with Policybazaar, we entered in 2008, and we are still there. The significant value has come in the last three or four years, which means that you need to stay invested for a long time before you truly get the value,\u201d he reportedly added.\u00a0 He also said, \u201cIf something blows up, you will obviously exit earlier. If there is a great acquisition offer that comes along and if the founder wants to take it, you can\u2019t really block that because you have to back the founder\u201d.

        "Article Content": "Instant messaging platform Telegram is reportedly being scrutinised by the government over allegations of extortion and gambling.\u00a0 A Moneycontrol report, citing a government official, said that the Centre could mull banning the Dubai based app in India on the basis of the probe\u2019s findings.\u00a0 The investigation is reportedly being led by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). \u201cThe I4C under MHA and MeitY have been looking into P2P communications on Telegram,\u201d a government official told the publication.\u00a0\u00a0 This isn\u2019t the first time that the company has ended up in regulatory troubles in India. Earlier this year in January, the Delhi High Court (Delhi HC) ordered the platform to remove or block access to  accounts allegedly used for cheating people  by using the name of private equity firms Peak XV Partners and Sequoia Capital. Its tenure in India has seen it land in multiple controversies throughout the year. For instance, reports back in 2019 highlighted that Telegram lacked proper cybersecurity against spyware and viruses for users.\u00a0 Besides, the platform is also a host to rampant piracy. In many such instances, the messaging app has escaped by evoking the Information Technology Act. Telegram has repeatedly claimed to be an intermediary and evaded any responsibility for the content being circulated. The probe comes at a time when Telegram\u2019s CEO Pavel Durov is also behind bars in France. Durov was arrested at the Paris airport over allegations that his messaging app facilitates criminality including money laundering and drug trafficking on August 25. \u201cIt is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform,\u201d Telegram said in a post on X after Durov\u2019s arrest.\u00a0 However, investigations on Telegram come at a time when the government has upped the ante for players engaged in illegal activities like gambling or extortion which often sees platforms like Telegram becoming a conduit for bad actors to spread social malice.\u00a0 For a user to get involved in betting on Telegram, they have to join groups and channels where tipsters share their predictions. These can range from free advice to premium tips, depending on the tipster\u2019s service About a week ago, the directorate of enforcement (ED) initiated a crackdown on gambling apps operating in India by handlers settled abroad. More than two dozen offshore gaming applications are  currently under ED\u2019s scanner  for remitting and round-tripping funds. These offshore gambling apps have caused gamblers to incur losses to the tunes of INR 1 Lakh Cr. Besides, on August 19, conducted searches at 20 premises across multiple cities in connection with a money laundering probe into  online betting platform \u201cmagicwin\u201d . Despite the Centre\u2019s efforts to clamp down on online betting, India\u2019s online gambling market is projected to touch the $5.49 Bn mark by 2032, as per a report by IMARC Group.",

        "Article Content": "The competition in the Indian electric two-wheeler landscape is heating up. Now, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India (HMSI) is reportedly planning to launch its first electric vehicle (EV) by March 2025.\u00a0 HMSI CEO Tsutsumu Otani told NDTV that the company plans to launch \u201cActiva Electric\u201d by the end of this fiscal year.  As per the report, the new EV will likely be an all-new product and as such Honda could use a different \u201cname plate\u201d for this vehicle.\u00a0 The report added that the company plans to leverage its battery swapping technology, Honda e:Swap, to power the escooter. Additionally, the EV could also be equipped with features such as a touchscreen infotainment unit, connected features, keyless operation, among others. Confirming the development, HMSI\u2019s director of sales and marketing, Yogesh Mathur, told\u00a0 PTI that the company plans to foray into the EV segment in the current fiscal itself, adding that it is eyeing one-third of its overall sales from the EV segment by 2030.\u00a0 \u201cAnd what we understand is that by 2030 there will be a major shift towards EVs and we have announced that by 2030 in our lineup also..one-third at least will be coming only from EV models,\u201d Mathur reportedly added.\u00a0 As per the PTI report, the new EV model is being developed jointly by HMSI in partnership with Honda teams. He also reiterated that the contribution of electric vehicles to the overall two-wheeler sales was continuing to grow.\u00a0 The comments come as EV vehicles continue to see rapid adoption across the country. Buoyed by government subsidies and sops, the ecosystem has seen the emergence of multiple new-age tech companies such as listed Ola Electric and IPO-bound Ather Energy and Pure EV.\u00a0 Sensing an opportunity, even legacy players such as TVS, Hero Motocorp and others also have unveiled their electric offerings to woo customers. With this, HSIL has become the latest to jump into the EV fray and capitalise on the growing demand for such vehicles.\u00a0 On September 10, union transport minister  Nitin Gadkari said that India will clock 1 Cr annual EV sales by 2030 , adding that the EV boom will create 5 Cr jobs in the country by the end of this decade. He added that the homegrown EV market will become an INR 20 Lakh Cr opportunity by 2030 while the EV financing market will soar to a size of INR 4 Lakh Cr by the same year.\u00a0 This comes as the  Centre is all set to roll out the third iteration of the Faster Adoption & Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles  (FAME) scheme in the coming two months.\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Geotech company MapmyIndia\u2019s consolidated profit after tax (PAT) declined 6% on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis to INR 35.9 Cr in the June quarter (Q1) of the financial year 2024-25 (FY25) amid a ramp down of some old auto original equipment (OE) customers and some other changes in its IoT-led business during the period. MapmyIndia  posted a PAT of INR 38.2 Cr on an operating revenue of INR 106.9 Cr in the preceding March quarter of the previous fiscal year. In Q1 FY25, the startup\u2019s operating revenue also declined 5.1% QoQ to INR 101.5 Cr. However, on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, MapmyIndia\u2019s PAT increased 12.1% from INR 32 Cr and operating revenue increased 13.5% from INR 89.4 Cr. The startup said in a statement, \u201cDuring Q1 FY25, there were known ramp down of some old Auto OE programs. (The) ramp-up of new programs has begun in Q2.\u201d \u201cAlso, IoT-led business prioritised higher-margin SaaS instead of new hardware sales,\u201d the statement added. MapmyIndia divides its market-wise revenue into two categories \u2013 automotive & mobility tech business (A&M) and consumer tech & enterprise digital transformation (C&E). It divides its product-wise revenue into two segments \u2013 map & data and platform & IoT.\u00a0 Commenting on the Q1 performance, Rakesh Verma, chairman and MD of the company, said, \u201cOur map-led business demonstrated strong growth of 17.2% and EBITDA margins of 50.1%. Our IoT-led business, as per our focus, showed tremendous growth of 89.6% in its high-margin SaaS revenue. During Q1 FY25, we also expanded the capabilities and addressable market for MapmyIndia to cover AI-driven data analytics and consulting needs of customers across industry verticals, and this will be beneficial to MapmyIndia in the time to come.\u201d\u00a0 Meanwhile, during the quarter, MapmyIndia\u2019s A&M revenue grew 9.5% YoY to INR 45 Cr and C&E revenue jumped 16.9% YoY to INR 56.5 Cr. In the C&E segment, its major go-lives included the UP Police\u2019s Dial 112 GenNext project and a project for the Indian army. Besides, the startup said that it had multiple wins in ecommerce, quick service restaurant, and delivery and mobility space for use cases such as location-based app personalisation and accurate address capture for delivery efficiency. In A&E, its key go-lives included Mahindra XUV3XO, Ampere Greaves Nexus, Ultraviolet F77 Mach 2 electric Bike, and BYD Atto 3. \u201cNew customer acquisition as well as up-sell and cross-sell of newer use cases and solutions to existing customers were on track, with key wins and go-lives across all our customer segments including automotive, fleets, new-age tech companies and traditional corporates, and the government, including defence,\u201d said company CEO Rohan Verma, commenting on the Q1 earnings. MapmyIndia said that its growth focus and outlook for all areas of business remain strong, and its long-term achievement goals are on track. It is also pertinent to note that apart from its own books, the share of loss from  KOGO , in which MapmyIndia holds a majority stake, stood at INR 38 Lakh in Q1 FY25, widening from a loss of INR 15 Lakh in the year-ago period. Similarly, the share of loss from  Indrones  stood at INR 18 Lakh in the reported quarter. MapmyIndia\u2019s total expenses increased 14.4% YoY but fell almost 12% QoQ to INR 63.9 Cr in Q1 FY25, with employee benefit expenses being the biggest cost head during the quarter. Employee Cost:  The startup\u2019s cost under the head jumped almost 20% to INR 20.7 Cr during the quarter under review from INR 17.3 Cr in Q1 FY24. Cost Of Materials:  On a YoY basis, MapmyIndia\u2019s expense in this bucket declined 26.6% to INR 10.4 Cr in Q1 FY25 while it fell a massive 53% QoQ. Its cost of materials includes both hardware and software. While the cost for software materials increased on YoY as well as QoQ basis, it declined sharply for hardware materials. Technical Services Outsource:\u00a0  MapmyIndia spent INR 11.6 Cr under this head in Q1, which increased 48.7% YoY. Marketing & Business Promotion Expenses:  The company spent INR 2.2 Cr in this bucket, which increased 30.5% from INR 1.7 Cr in Q1 FY24. Ahead of its Q1 FY25 earnings, shares of MapmyIndia rose over 2% to close at 2,226.9 on the BSE. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that  MapmyIndia recently sent a legal notice to electric two-wheeler major Ola Electric  accusing the company of illicitly copying its data to build its Ola Maps interface.\u00a0\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Days after geotech company MapmyIndia\u2019s parent entity CE Info Systems accused Ola Electric of illicitly copying its data to build its Ola Maps interface, the former\u2019s CEO Rohan Verma has said that the quality of Ola Maps is not up to the mark and that Google\u2019s pricing is inconsistent. He expressed confidence about MapmyIndia\u2019s market position amid Google slashing subscription prices for its maps platform and Ola announcing a new pricing structure to attract developers to Ola Maps. \u201cWhen it comes to pricing, we base it on the value we provide to our customers. We have always been price conscious. Unlike some competitors who fluctuate between offering services for free, charging high prices, or frequently changing their rates, we have been consistently predictable, reliable, and value-based for our customers,\u201d said Verma in a post-earnings call. It is important to note that while Google Maps and  MapmyIndia  are the two most dominant players in the mapping services space, Ola Maps entered the segment in June. Other notable competitors include Apple Maps, Dutch giant HERE Technologies, TomTom, MapBox and OpenStreetMaps. \u201cRegarding competition, there\u2019s one type like Google, and then there\u2019s the new entrant offering everything for free. Let them do it. Any serious user, I doubt, will consider using something that doesn\u2019t work. As for Google reducing prices, we are not too concerned about that either. It seems they were responding to our pricing that\u2019s what took them some time. It\u2019s just a coincidence that the new entrant also made their move at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the second part is, we\u2019ve been dealing with competition for so long, and the competition has often been arbitrary with pricing. We, however, have stayed close to our customers, pricing based on the value we provide and through mutual agreement,\u201d Verma added. He said that the increased noise and adoption in the mapping industry reinforces the company\u2019s belief in becoming a disproportionate winner, adding that mapping is a challenging and serious business requiring long-term expertise, investment and a proven track record. Despite numerous global and Indian competitors over the years, only a few have succeeded, with MapmyIndia standing out for its accuracy and quality, he added. The company is not only focused on maps but also innovating across multiple products and industries, including IoT and 4D solutions. Commenting on whether its customers might switch to Ola Maps or Google Maps, Verma said that switching providers is not easy.\u00a0 He further mentioned that the company is on track to achieve a milestone of INR 1,000 Cr revenue by FY27 or FY28.\u00a0 \u201cOur revenue projections are based on the growth in our open order book. While our business can experience some lumpiness, we are not concerned, as the overall trend indicates growth in the right direction,\u201d he added. MapmyIndia divides its market-wise revenue into two categories \u2013 automotive & mobility tech business (A&M) and consumer tech & enterprise digital transformation (C&E). It divides its product-wise revenue into two segments \u2013 map & data and platform & IoT.\u00a0 The geotech company\u2019s consolidated profit after tax (PAT) declined 6% on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis to  INR 35.9 Cr  in the June quarter (Q1) of the financial year 2024-25 (FY25). Operating revenue declined  5.1% QoQ to INR 101.5 Cr.",

        "Article Content": "Barring regulatory approvals, Bharti Group-backed satcom services provider OneWeb claims to be ready to roll out the satellite broadband service in the country. Touting operational readiness of the company, parent Bharti Group chairman Sunil Mittal on Monday (August 12) said that it is awaiting nod from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to commence operations.\u00a0 He also said that the company has approached the government to accelerate the process of granting these approval to the satcom operator.\u00a0 \u201cIt is ready to go now\u2026the satellites are all spinning around India all the time\u2026we are now just waiting for a signal from the DoT to light up those SNPs (satellite network portals) for commercial service, and it could be anytime\u2026We have requested the government to accelerate the process because it is much-needed, especially by the government agencies in difficult remote areas,\u201d Mittal said as per news agency PTI. For the uninitiated, the company is a joint venture between Bharti Enterprises and French satellite operator Eutelsat. In a virtual address on the sidelines of Bharti Global acquiring a 25% stake in British telecom major BT Group, Mittal reportedly said that Eutelsat OneWeb\u2019s two satellite network portals (SNPs) are ready and are located in northern and southern parts of the country. As per the report, he said that the company has already conducted tests to demonstrate proof of concept to the Army, Navy and other government agencies. He expects the approvals to come \u201canytime\u201d soon. \u201cThe terminals are in India, we are just waiting\u2026there is nothing we can do because we can\u2019t light it up other than our test case, which has been approved\u2026we can\u2019t go commercial until we have it (approvals),\u201d he added. While saying that DoT has already sent a reference to the TRAI to start the consultation on the matter and grant approvals to the company. \u201c\u2026so as soon as the TRAI comes out\u2026I would say we should be expected to get the approval\u2026In fact, we have given an undertaking to DoT that you can even give us permission in the interim, and whatever the final decision is, we will comply with that\u2026It is a wait from DoT now. We are fully ready,\u201d Mittal was quoted as saying. This comes just days after Apple\u2019s satcom partner Globalstar, in a submission to the TRAI, said that it was  planning to apply for a licence to offer satcom services in India . GMPCS, or global mobile personal communication by satellite services, licence is the first step towards launching satcom services in India.\u00a0 So far, only Bharti Group-backed Eutelsat OneWeb and Reliance-owned Orbit Connect India have received the GMPCS licence and authorisation from IN-SPACe. However, the likes of global giants such as Elon Musk-led Starlink and Amazon-backed Project Kuiper too have sought authorisation from the government to offer satellite communication services in the country.\u00a0 At the heart of all this is the homegrown satcom space, which, as per the government, could be key to  delivering internet services to 1.2 Bn Indians by 2025-26 .",

According to a report by PTI, the company will dissolve Wynk Music and absorb all its employees.\u00a0 \u201cWe can confirm that we will sunset Wynk Music and all Wynk music employees will be absorbed within the Airtel ecosystem. Airtel users will have access to Apple Music. Additionally, Wynk Premium users will receive exclusive offers from Airtel for Apple,\u201d a company spokesperson told the news agency.\u00a0 Earlier in the day, Airtel said it has partnered with Apple to bring exclusive offers of Apple TV+ and Apple Music to its customers. The company said Wynk Premium users will roll into Apple Music and get exclusive offers. Besides, the partnership will see Airtel Xstream customers gain access to Apple TV+ content as part of Airtel\u2019s premium Wi-Fi and postpaid plans. The Apple Music and Apple TV+ offers will be available exclusively to Airtel customers in India soon.\u00a0 The latest development comes a decade after the launch of Wynk Music in 2014. At the time, it was one of the first music streaming platforms in India. It lets users download and listen to songs while offline. Its premium subscription comes at INR 99 per month.\u00a0 While Wynk was one of the  early movers in India\u2019s music streaming market , the market has seen a number of changes over the past decade. According to a report by Redseer, Spotify was the dominant player with the highest number of users between 2020-23. In FY23, Spotify commanded a 26% market share in the Indian online streaming market.\u00a0 As a result, other homegrown players  have struggled to grow . Gaana.com, once Wynk\u2019s arch rival, was acquired by Times Internet-owned Entertainment Network (India) Limited in December 2023 for INR 25 Lakh.\u00a0 YouTube Music, Amazon Music, JioSaavn are among the other players in the Indian music streaming market, which is projected to become a $660 Mn opportunity by 2027, as per Statista.",

Besides, it also signed an MoU with Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) to collaborate on a joint working group to accelerate processor design and manufacturing for High Performance Computing (HPC) in India. On the other hand, construction giant L&T\u2019s semiconductor arm LTSCT claims to be India\u2019s first semiconductor product company. It aims to build an India-based semiconductor portfolio of smart devices across MEMS sensors, power, analog mixed signal and RF products to support automotive, industrial, energy and telecommunication verticals. The company also signed an MoU with C-DAC last week to jointly develop India-driven chip technology and the ecosystem around it. Besides, it also entered into a similar arrangement with IIT-Gandhinagar for collaboration on futuristic semiconductors research and development. On the partnership with IBM, LTSCT CEO Sandeep Kumar said \u201cThe goal of our work with IBM is to harness our cutting-edge semiconductor design technology and IBM\u2019s advanced processors to forge next-gen technology products.\u201d The two semiconductor majors have joined hands at a time when India\u2019s semiconductor space is buzzing with activities.

        "Article Content": "Non banking financial company (NBFC)  Flexiloans  has raised INR 290 Cr (around $34.5 Mn) as a part of its Series C funding round from a clutch of investors, including Accion, Maj Invest, Nuveen and Fundamentum. Cofounder Deepak Jain told Inc42 that the fresh infusion will help the NBFC to further fuel its growth, increase product stack and grow its businesses. He added that they are also looking to expand into the supply chain financing market, as well as partnerships with traditional corporate finance platforms, in terms of vendor and dealer financing. India being the epicentre of manufacturing, the potential of the supply chain is expected to undergo great transformation in the next five to ten years. The company is, thus, willing to bet on this favourable trend to expand its business, Jain said. Founded in 2016 by Deepak Jain, Ritesh Jain and Manish Lunia, FlexiLoans is an online lending platform that targets small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and other underserved segments to provide quick and flexible loans.\u00a0 So far, the fintech startup claims to have disbursed over INR 7,000 Cr in loans across over 2,100 towns and cities.\u00a0 In 2022, the digital lending company  raised  $90 Mn through a mix of equity and debt financing in its Series B funding round from investors such as Denmark-based MAJ Invest, UK-based Fasanara Capital, and others.\u00a0 Additionally, the Mumbai-based startup  secured  a debt funding of INR 75 Cr (around $9 Mn) from JM Financials Limited through issuance of non-convertible debentures (NCDs), in August. This development comes at a time when lending companies are raising capital fueled by the motive to aid MSMEs across the country. In the past three months\u2019 time, companies such as  Arthan Finance ,  Lendingkart ,  Aye Finance ,  Moneyboxx ,  Clix Capital  have raised capital from various investors with a common motive to boost their game in MSME lending among other goals. Meanwhile, two weeks ago, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) revealed its plans to soon launch a platform called \u2018 Unified Lending Interface \u2019, to offer credit to rural and small businesses, which will cater to large unmet demand for credit across various sectors, particularly for agricultural and MSME borrowers.",

Kasture, in a LinkedIn post, said, \u201cI cannot think of a better time to take up the role as GM for the SMC business in India and South Asia. At a time when corporates and SMBs are harnessing the power of technology for everything from Cloud to AI, data to security, enriching every workflow with Gen AI as the go-to tool for productivity uplift, Microsoft is singularly positioned as a full-service technology company focussing on end-to-end technology stack.\u201d As per a Moneycontrol report, Microsoft India and South Asia head Puneet Chandok announced the appointment in an email to employees.\u00a0 \u201cI am delighted to welcome Vaishali Kasture as the SMC lead for India and South Asia.

At AWS, she set up the independent software vendors (ISV) segment and led the digital native and enterprise segments. She stepped down as the interim country head of AWS India in December last year. She is the second AWS India executive that Microsoft has poached in the past one year. In June last year, the big tech major roped in ex-AWS India head Puneet Chandok as the corporate vice president of Microsoft India and South Asia. Kasture\u2019s appointment comes as Microsoft looks to strengthen its position in the Indian cloud market, take on giant AWS, and complement its expansion plans in the country. Microsoft plans to establish its largest India data centre in Hyderabad with an investment of INR 15,000 Cr spanning 15 years. Microsoft competes with the likes of AWS and Google Cloud in the competitive cloud computing space. As more and more businesses move online and the demand grows for cloud products, the big tech majors are vying for a piece of the growing market.\u00a0 As per a report, the Indian cloud services market is projected to reach a market size of $24.2 Bn by 2028.",

While intimating about Paytm\u2019s strategic pivot during the annual general meeting today (September 12), founder and managing director Vijay Shekhar Sharma underscored the company\u2019s commitment to demonstrating genuine financial performance and operational maturity. \u201cMy board members advised me to shift the focus from EBITDA before ESOP as a benchmark to PAT. We recognise that EBITDA before ESOP, due to its large ESOP charge, provides only a partial picture of our financial health. Our commitment is now to focus on PAT, reflecting our drive towards true profitability,\u201d Sharma said. EBITDA, short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is an alternate measure of profitability to net income.

In a statement, the startup said that these certifications will help it in protecting member data, ensuring safer transactions, and empowering members with more control over  their personal information. \u201cThese certifications are not just about compliance\u2014they are about building trust with our members, partners, and regulators. As we align with evolving data protection regulations, we will continue to work closely with regulators to lead by example in the fintech industry,\u201d CRED\u2019s founder and CEO Kunal Shah said.\u00a0 ISO is a Switzerland-based organisation that develops international standards for exchange of goods and services. The ISO 27001 certification essentially means CRED follows international practices for information security management, while the ISO 27701:2019 certification is for meeting international standards for managing and protecting personal data. Finally, the PCI DSS v4.0 certification is awarded by the Payment Security Standards Council to companies that demonstrate their ability to meet a set of security standards for processing, storing, and transmitting credit card data. CRED claimed it is among a select group to have received these three certificates. The company has embraced a platform approach since late 2022 and added a slew of products to flesh out the super app strategy.\u00a0 Most recently, it launched a personal finance management product CRED Money and in the past year, it has added revenue streams from acquired stock trading platform Kuvera, CRED Store, payment aggregator, personal loans, insurance commissions and more, as highlighted in our recent in-depth look at the  CRED revenue stack .\u00a0 Cybersecurity is a major consideration for startups in general, but for fintech platforms in particular, in light of the cyber-attack on  crypto platform WazirX earlier this year . It led to WazirX users losing investments to the tune of $230 Mn, with the issue unlikely to be resolved any time soon.\u00a0 Over the past few years, there have been other examples, such as the data breach at  fintech platform Juspay  in early 2021, where the data of 10 Cr users was compromised. Or Mobikwik in the same year, a breach which is  said to have affected over 100 Mn users .\u00a0\u00a0 Incidentally, the central government unveiled a host of initiatives yesterday (September 11).

        "Article Content": "Fintech giant  Paytm  is fully committed to integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in its core payment business, founder and chief executive Vijay Shekhar Sharma said. At the company\u2019s 24th annual general meeting, Sharma said that Paytm is leveraging AI to develop new technologies, and has already integrated the technology across all its business segments. \u201cSome technologies being built are so good, if you fork it out, it could become a standalone business vertical,\u201d Sharma said. However, at the moment, Paytm will focus on its core payment business and cross-selling financial services, as the company seeks to become profitable, Sharma added. The Paytm chief also predicted that AI will significantly impact every industry and early adopters will have the first mover advantage. Sharma said that in the next five years, India will be a leader in financial technology and will have the obligation to lead the AI technology. On that note, he also acknowledged that there is a demand and forward-looking expectation on Paytm to be able to bring an AI-powered risk management committee. \u201cRisk management options, credit risk, fraud risk, future underwriting of insurance will all be led by AI. The generative AI interaction with financial services will be underwriting,\u201d he said in the meeting. This meeting was held a month after the company reported its  first quarter  results. The listed fintech major\u2019s consolidated net loss widened 134% year-on-year to INR 840.1 Cr in the June quarter of FY25 as compared to INR 358.4 Cr, a year ago. Meanwhile, its quarterly revenue from operations also declined 36% to INR 1,502 Cr from INR 2,342 Cr, in the previous year. However, Paytm cut its overall spending by 11.5% YoY to INR 2,476.4 Cr in Q1 FY25 from INR 2800 Cr in the year-ago quarter. The company, as per reports, shrinked its  employee headcount  by around 5,000 to 6,300, or around 15-20% of the total workforce to save costs of INR 400-500 Cr, earlier this year. Prior to that, Paytm  laid off  employees from some departments by as much as 20%, as part of its annual performance review, in March. In March, too, there were reports which said Paytm had directed \u201csome departments\u2026 to reduce their team size by as much as 20%.\u201d\u00a0 Sharma highlighted that costs have been saved so far through various measures, and the company is planning to further cut costs with the help of AI. The company is paying many cloud service providers and third party service providers to boost the enterprise softwares. The company has seen multiple leadership exits through the year, and Sharma  took charge  of Paytm in the month of May, amid a major restructuring move at the fintech giant. On the grounds of the company\u2019s leadership, he said that the senior leadership team is expanding in areas core to payment and financial services, which can be anticipated in the coming quarters. The shares of the fintech juggernaut stood at INR 659.20 on the BSE as of 01:06 PM in the intraday trading today (September 12), marking a 1.2% decline compared to the previous close of INR 667.",

The Delhi NCR-based startup is aiming to raise up to INR 700 Cr through a fresh issue of shares. The IPO will not include any offer for sale (OFS) component. It is worth noting that MobiKwik has reduced its IPO size by nearly 63% from the INR 1,900 Cr it aimed to raise when it first filed its DRHP in 2021. At that time, the startup planned to raise INR 1,500 Cr from a fresh issue of shares and INR 400 Cr via OFS. However, it postponed its IPO plans due to volatile market conditions. However, the bullish investor sentiment in the markets have led to a resurgence in startup IPOs this year. While the likes of Go Digit, Ola Electric, FirstCry, Awfis, Unicommerce have made their public market debut this year, a number of other new-age tech startups are also looking to go public over the coming months.",

Smartworks had 651 employees as of March 31, 2024 against 564 employees a year ago, as per the DRHP. Smartworks  IPO will comprise a fresh issue of equity shares worth INR 550 Cr  and an offer for sale (OFS) component of 67.49 Lakh equity shares. The net proceeds from the fresh issue will be used for capital expenditure related to fit-outs in the new centres, security deposits for the new centres, and other general corporate purposes. Additionally, the proceeds will be allocated towards the repayment, prepayment, or redemption of certain borrowings. The startup also intends to raise INR 110 Cr through a pre-IPO placement prior to filing its red herring prospectus (RHP). Smartworks currently operates over 8 Mn sq. ft. of office space across 40+ locations spanning 14 cities, including Bengaluru, Kolkata, Delhi NCR and Mumbai. It claims to cater to more than 600 enterprises, including Honeywell, Starbucks Coffee, DHL, and Moglix. The startup competes against the likes of Awfis, WeWork India and IndiaQube. Amid the IPO boom in the Indian equities market, a number of startups have gone public recently and many others are in the process of going public. Smartworks\u2019 rival Awfis made its public market debut in May this year. Its shares listed at INR 432.25 apiece on the BSE, a premium of 12.8% to the issue price.",

        "Article Content": "Tata-owned BigBasket\u2019s B2C arm, Innovative Retail Concepts, posted a 17% decline in its net loss to INR 1,267.2 Cr in the financial year 2023-24 (FY24) from INR 1,535.2 Cr in the previous fiscal, partially helped by its controlled expenses. The online grocery retailer\u2019s operating revenue saw about a 6% rise to INR 7,884.5 Cr during the year from INR 7,439.7 Cr in FY23, with revenue from the sale of traded products continuing to be the largest contributor. BigBasket  clocked INR 7,609.6 Cr in revenue from the sale of traded products, which included household and grocery products, as against 7,175.2 Cr in FY23.\u00a0 Meanwhile, its advertisement income increased a mere 0.5% year-on-year (YoY) to INR 230.7 Cr in FY24. Licence fees income remained flat, while rental income more than doubled to INR 11 Cr. BigBasket earns its rental income from operating leases on its vending machines. Revenue from services stood at INR 256.8 Cr in FY24, which was an increase of 4.6% YoY.\u00a0 The company\u2019s revenue from BB Star membership fees was included in revenue from services in FY24 filing and not mentioned separately. It also saw INR 9.1 Cr coming in from two new revenue sources \u2013 commission Income and technology services income. The technology services income was generated from Tata Group\u2019s Infiniti Retail, while commission income came from Tata 1mg Healthcare Solutions Private Limited. It is pertinent to note that in 2021, Tata Digital Limited, a 100% subsidiary of Tata Sons Private Limited, acquired a majority stake in BigBasket\u2019s holding company Supermarket Grocery Supplies Private Limited. In December 2022, Tata infused further capital in BigBasket. BigBasket\u2019s income from scrap sales declined 5.5% YoY to INR 18.1 Cr during the year. Total expenses rose a mere 2% to  INR 9,185.7 Cr in FY24 from INR 8,997.6 Cr in the previous fiscal. Purchases Of Stock-In-Trade:  It continued to be the biggest contributor to overall expenses. The startup\u2019s spending under this head saw a 3.4% rise to INR 6,260.9 Cr during the year under review from INR 6,053.4 Cr in FY23. Employee Benefit Expenses:  BigBasket cut its employee cost by 9.6% to INR 827.5 Cr in FY24 from INR 915.6 Cr in the previous fiscal year. In that, INR 659.3 Cr was spent towards salaries and wages, which fell from about INR 690 Cr in FY23. Training Recruitment Expenses:  The company\u2019s spending in this bucket fell by a massive 70% YoY to INR 2.1 Cr. Ad Expenses:  BigBasket\u2019s advertising and promotional expenses declined 14.2% to INR 329.9 Cr in FY24 from INR 384.7 Cr the previous fiscal year.\u00a0 Transportation Cost:  The startup spent INR 738.9 Cr under this head during the year under review as against INR 681.6 Cr in FY23. Amid the rising popularity of quick commerce, BigBasket has also set its eye on the rapidly growing segment. It is planning to  merge BBdaily subscription service into its main app  in the coming months as part of the strategy to strengthen its position in quick commerce.",

        "Article Content": "The B2B arm of Tata-owned quick commerce giant BigBasket, Supermarket Grocery Supplies Private Limited, narrowed its consolidated net loss 20.7% year-on-year (YoY) to INR 1,415.2 Cr in the fiscal year 2023-24 (FY24), as it managed to control its expenses. It had  reported a loss of INR 1,785.4 Cr  in the previous fiscal year.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the company\u2019s top line crossed the INR 10,000 Cr mark during the year under review. The quick commerce major\u2019s B2B arm reported an operating revenue of INR 10,061 Cr in FY24, up 6% from INR 9,468 Cr in FY23.\u00a0 It is pertinent to note that the financial results of the B2B entity also include the numbers of BigBasket\u2019s B2C subsidiary, Innovative Retail Concepts Private Limited.\u00a0 Supermarket Grocery\u2019s subsidiaries include Innovative Retail, Savis Retail Private Limited, Delyver Retail Network Private Limited, and Dailyninja Delivery Services Private Limited. Founded in 2011 by Hari Menon, VS Sudhakar, Vipul Parekh, VS Ramesh and Abhinay Choudhari,  BigBasket  started off as a grocery and hyperlocal delivery platform. In 2021, Tata Digital acquired a majority stake in the online grocer. Under Tata\u2019s tutelage, the  platform is now pivoting to the quick commerce model , which it expects to complete by September 2024. Earlier this month, the company also reportedly began work on merging its BBdaily subscription service into its main app as part of its strategy to bolster quick commerce push. Besides quick commerce,  BigBasket has also been experimenting with enterprise tech tools  to bolster its deliveries across verticals and help new businesses go online. The startup recently launched a SaaS based supply chain platform BB Matrix to help businesses manage their supply chains for deliveries. It is pertinent to note that BigBasket operates as an online grocery store, making deliveries in three modes: one day delivery BBDaily, quick commerce vertical BBNow, and Slotted Delivery.\u00a0 BigBasket\u2019s B2B arm reined in its expenses during the fiscal as total expenditure rose a mere 2% YoY to INR 11,515 Cr in the fiscal year ended March 2024. In FY23, the company\u2019s total expenses stood at INR 11,284 Cr.\u00a0 Here is a breakdown of Supermarket Grocery Supplies\u2019 biggest cost centres: Purchases Of Stock-In-Trade : Expenses under this head rose 4% to INR 8,339 Cr in FY24 from INR INR 8,016 Cr in the previous fiscal year.\u00a0 Employee Benefit Expenses : Employee-related costs declined more than 11% to INR 936.5 in the fiscal ended March 2024 from INR 1,060 Cr in FY23.\u00a0 Advertising & Promotional Expenses : The B2B arm of BigBasket spent INR 330 Cr on advertising expenses in FY24, a decline of 14% from INR 385 Cr in FY23.\u00a0 Transportation Distribution Costs:  Expenses incurred under this bucket rose more than 8% to INR 785.4 Cr in FY24 from INR 726.1 Cr in the fiscal year ended March 2023.\u00a0 Cost Technical Services : Expenses under this head rose 14.4% to INR 142.21 Cr during the year under review from INR 124.3 Cr in FY23.

        "Article Content": "The Indian startup ecosystem has been on a rollercoaster ride since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, oscillating between exhilarating highs and disheartening lows.\u00a0 While the initial years of the pandemic were marked by a massive capital influx, the prolonged funding winter, since 2022, has forced many startups to re-evaluate their strategies and adapt to the changing landscape.\u00a0 Indian startups  managed to raise a mere $7 Bn in funding between January and September 2023 , a figure even lower than the $8 Bn that they secured during the corresponding period way back in 2020. Needless to say, startup funding has reverted to pre-pandemic levels, and this, according to investors, is the new normal. Amid the current scheme of things, bootstrapping appears to have emerged as a major undercurrent within the world\u2019s third-largest startup ecosystem. Focused on innovation and customer-centricity, a new breed of more resilient and frugal homegrown ventures are carving their niche in the startup ecosystem. It is this resourcefulness that forms the core of the 42nd edition of  Inc42\u2019s 30 Startups To Watch , as a third of this month\u2019s cohort is bootstrapped. More so, a mere five startups have raised more than $1 Mn in funding.\u00a0 This trend mirrors the fact that the country\u2019s new-age ventures are shedding their reliance on VC and PE capital, a lesson that almost every investor wants Indian startup founders to learn. Well, better late than never! Moving on, another recurring theme playing out within the early-stage startup ecosystem appears to be the B2B shift, a segment that is loaded with high-ticket billing. Continuing our tradition of identifying some of the most pathbreaking startups every month, we bring you 30 startups that caught our attention in November. Editor\u2019s Note: The list below is not a ranking of any kind. We have listed the startups alphabetically. Founded in 2015 by Pratik Saraogi, Tushar Patil, and Dr Ateeb Shaikh,  Actofit  helps individuals track the progress of their healthcare journey. The startup offers smartwatches, smart scales, chest straps, continuous glucose monitors (CGM) and smart rings, along with a companion app that offers deep insights based on data collected by Actofit devices. The startup\u2019s smart scales use advanced sensors to measure body composition metrics, including weight, body fat percentage, muscle mass, bone density, and visceral fat. These scales sync with the companion app, allowing users to track progress, receive personalised insights and recommendations, and access guidance from a team of personal trainers. The other devices operate, as the label says, with all devices feeding data into the Actofit app for insights. The Mumbai-based startup primarily makes money from its smart devices and subscription fees for its premium app features. Additionally, the startup generates revenue through partnerships with healthcare providers, corporate wellness programmes, and fitness centres. The company also explores opportunities for data monetisation, leveraging its vast repository of user data to provide valuable insights to research institutions and pharmaceutical companies. Noticing a discernible gap in the Indian luxury body care and perfumes market, Jagrattan Singh Anand and Pravneet Kaur Anand established  ANMER London  in 2022.\u00a0 ANMER\u2019s product line includes premium body care offerings such as perfumes, body washes, hand and body hydration, and shower oils. Their formulations, meticulously crafted in the UK, boast clean beauty ingredients. ANMER London\u2019s commitment to sustainability extends beyond its formulations to eco-friendly packaging with recycled materials and refillable glass bottles.\u00a0 The Delhi NCR-based startup has crafted a revenue model that blends direct-to-consumer (D2C) channels, online marketplaces, offline exhibitions, and potential brand collaborations. With a 70% D2C and 30% marketplace sales ratio, ANMER London ensures a direct and personalised connection with customers while expanding its reach through renowned platforms like Ajio Luxe, Tira Beauty, Amazon, and Flipkart. As part of its strategic focus for 2024, ANMER London plans to expand its range of fragrances, diversify its product portfolio with body mists and soap bars, and foray into the burgeoning market of home fragrances. By 2026, the brand plans to enter new segments like home and car fragrances, and establish offline stores for a tangible and immersive brand experience. It also has celebrity endorsements on the cards. Founded in 2021 by Gouthami T S and Jitendra Kumar Purnmal Saini,  AquaAirX  has built an AI-powered amphibious drone capable of operating underwater and on land. This feature makes it ideal for offshore search and rescue missions, environmental monitoring, asset monitoring and military operations, among other amphibious applications. At the heart of AquaAirX lies its groundbreaking multiplane propulsion system, designed to enable the drone to manoeuvre with precision in both air and water. The multiplane propulsion system can transition between media within seconds. The startup also has multiple model options designed for a variety of applications and services, each model being equipped with a customised array of sensors. While AquaAirX is yet to make its commercial debut, Aeronuts has a clear vision for its future. The company plans to adopt a drone-as-a-service (DAAS) model, partnering with government contractors to provide access to AquaAirX\u2019s capabilities on an as-needed basis. Healthier lifestyle choices often start with food, and it is a general perception that healthy food is tasteless and boring. Founded in 2020 by IIT Delhi graduates Harshita Kejriwal and Karan Dwivedi,  Basil  resolves this with its tasty health drinks and smoothies. The healthtech startup offers a selection of 28 drinks through nine locations across Delhi NCR. Basil\u2019s range of refreshers, smoothies, shakes, health-conscious coffee, hot beverages, pressed juices, and other drinks are made with fresh natural ingredients. The startup claims that there is no added sugar or preservatives in its drinks. Basil also ensures that the drinks are ready to be consumed within five minutes of ordering. Its drinks start at INR 69 and go up to INR 299. In the ever-advancing universe of AI & ML, Indian chatbots are not exactly setting the best examples. This is because many are being built with pre-programmed responses, resulting in inaccuracies and unhelpful interactions. After keenly observing the white space in the existing chatbot technologies and what consumers are being offered in the form of AI-driven customer support, Vikas Kookna and Navjot Singh Cheema founded  Chatclient.ai  this year.\u00a0 Unlike traditional bots, the Bengaluru-based startup leverages advanced LLMs, enabling instant, autonomous, and personalised customer support. According to the startup\u2019s website, the startup helps businesses create custom AI chatbots based on the company data, just like ChatGPT, and seamlessly integrate it as a widget on their sites. \u00a0 Operating on a subscription-based SaaS model, Chatclient.ai caters to diverse business needs. The model ensures a steady revenue stream while offering flexibility and scalability to businesses, ranging from startups to large enterprises. Currently operating globally with a focus on English-speaking markets, the technology supports around 95 languages, providing room for future expansion. In the last three months, the startup claims to have seen a 25% increase in the customer base. In the short term, the startup wants to expand language offerings, improve contextual understanding, and double its customer base. Chatclient.ai\u2019s long-term vision is to enable chatbots to process audio and video inputs and integrate with more platforms. ESG (environmental, social, and governance) reporting is a crucial aspect of performance evaluation for enterprises, especially in the context of climate change and other related issues. However, the intricate process of collecting and analysing data on the environmental impact of a company proves to be challenging. As a result, only a few companies successfully execute ESG reporting, contributing to significant confusion within the industry. Founded in 2018 by Arun Aggarwal, Pankaj Mathur and Ashish Airon, CogniTensor offers AI-driven solutions focused on ESG compliance and sustainability management.\u00a0 CogniTensor\u2019s flagship product, Sustain3P, ingeniously combines data analytics, AI insights and performance tracking. The startup\u2019s unique selling proposition (USP) lies in AI-powered analytics, offering energy optimisation, predictive maintenance, and robust ESG reporting. This product addresses key industry needs such as real-time energy management, predictive insights for sustainable practices, and comprehensive ESG compliance reporting. The revenue model is structured on a subscription basis with tiered pricing, tailored to the unique needs and sizes of client organisations. In the past three months, CogniTensor has onboarded three major corporate clients. In the short term, CogniTensor aims to strengthen its presence in India, initiate operations in the Middle East and augment its AI capabilities for predictive analytics. Founded in 2023 by Gaurav Mehta, Concur has been incorporated to play a pivotal role in the data protection space. The startup positions itself as a Digital Personal Data Protection Act compliance solution provider and is on a mission to harmonise data protection compliance for digital nagriks.\u00a0 Concur  has its eyes set on safeguarding personal data. Its innovative suite of enterprise solutions is designed to simplify compliance and protect sensitive information, ensuring that businesses and individuals can navigate the complex world of data protection with ease and confidence. The startup\u2019s solutions encompass automated data discovery, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) categorisation, data lifecycle management, content management, systems integration, and DPO office operations.\u00a0 With a freemium model, Concur has successfully onboarded seven diverse organisations, ranging from NFBCs to technology enterprises. By 2026, Mumbai-headquartered Concur wants to enter the markets of Saudi Arabia and Brazil. Despite being a renowned tourism destination and a culturally significant region in India, the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir still needs to improve on the technology and innovation front. However,  Curve Electric  aims to disrupt the status quo. Established in Srinagar in 2022 by Sheikh Yameen, the startup introduces a fleet of e-bikes through an extensive rental programme inclusive of maintenance, insurance, and 24/7 support. With 11 strategically placed docking stations across the valley, Curve Electric is dedicated to transforming the local landscape. Beyond the conventional rental model for individual users, the startup also enables businesses to advertise on their e-bikes, creating an additional revenue stream. \n Founded in 2023 by Abhishek Verma, Bengaluru-based  DoubtClear AI  utilises advanced ML and Gen AI models to instantly resolve doubts of students \u2014 ranging from third graders to PhD candidates. The edtech startup claims to be combating the challenges of accessibility and socio-economic disparities in the Indian edtech space by developing scalable solutions that are affordable and cater to diverse learning styles. Operating on a subscription-based Software as a Service (SaaS) model, users can ask unlimited doubt. Already operational on Android and serving 174 countries in APAC, Europe, and the Americas, the platform is gearing up for an iOS deployment by 2024. A key highlight of DoubtClear AI\u2019s 2024 roadmap is the customisation of its ML algorithms for specific exam types. DoubtClear AI\u2019s revenue model revolves around monthly and annual subscriptions. The startup has ambitious plans to introduce immersive learning courses by 2026. India\u2019s holiday homes market is projected to reach $8 Bn in the next 3-4 years. Amid this, the share of fractional ownership of holiday homes, too, is anticipated to rise to 5% from a mere 1% currently. Founded in 2021 by Mohit Prem Gupta, Puneet Gupta, Abhishek Madhukar, and Aashish Raj,  Equity Address  wants to be the key force behind redefining the Indian holiday homes market, making it a compelling choice for investors seeking modern and accessible avenues for real estate investment. This tech-enabled marketplace facilitates co-ownership of second homes, democratising access to this asset class. The platform seeks to simplify the investment process in second homes, making it more accessible to a broader audience. By allowing fractional ownership, Equity Address tackles the traditional barriers associated with owning holiday homes. The model involves a 5% revenue share on each fraction sold and 3% on fraction re-sale, ensuring a sustainable and mutually beneficial ecosystem. Equity Address and The Venya are two of its vertically integrated technology platforms. Equity Address offers a modern investment approach, allowing individuals to co-own second homes through a tech-enabled marketplace. Meanwhile, The Venya serves as a global marketplace for luxury vacation home rentals. The startup has already secured mandates of INR 50 Cr worth of assets in Goa. Looking ahead, the company projects an AUM of INR 100 Cr by 2024 and envisions an AUM of INR 400 Cr by 2026. Even though India\u2019s third-party logistics ecosystem comprises a healthy mix of big and small players, issues like limited visibility into fleet operations, inaccurate delivery time estimates and high delivery costs continue to sour the overall customer experience. Set up in 2021 by Moidu Chandanam, Motilal Keshavdas, Javokhir Vapaev, Nabeel Abdul, and Dattatray Kanaki,  Fleetroot  has built a logistics SaaS solution that enables enterprises to control their supply chain more efficiently by allowing them to optimise their delivery routes and operations. The startup\u20191s automated route planner helps businesses save time and money by efficiently managing their delivery fleet. Fleetroot uses predictive analytics to anticipate delays and disruptions, helping businesses avoid missed deliveries and customer dissatisfaction. The startup further provides real-time tracking of deliveries, allowing businesses to monitor the progress of their shipments and keep their customers informed. Fleetroot\u2019s APIs can integrate with almost all the popular CRM and ERP platforms, enabling businesses to easily get started. The startup offers its solution for free for the first 14 days, following which users can select any one of the three plans it offers, based on the size of their business and the number of deliveries they expect to make in a given month. India\u2019s booming startup ecosystem has created a new wave of women entrepreneurs who are now driving economic growth. With the country\u2019s GDP set to reach $5 Tn by the end of 2025, these women are breaking barriers to lead diverse industries. One such venture is Ahmedabad-based  Frendy . Founded in 2019 by Sameer Gandotra and Gowrav Vishwakarma, the startup is a convenience store network for India\u2019s small towns that leverages existing micro-stores such as family-run kirana stores and new home-based stores set up by housewives as a last mile distribution point. The platform sells household items with the help of its women community leaders or Frendy Partners. It claims to have expanded to over 40 Tier II- Tier VI towns in Gujarat, serving 50K customers with over 4.5K products.\u00a0 Frendy, which sells beauty, cleaning, grocery, and kitchen products, among others, under its private-label portfolio, claims that its revenue doubled to INR 82 Cr in FY23 from INR 40 Cr in the previous fiscal. Anticipated to account for a significant chunk of the $400 Bn ecommerce opportunity by 2025, the D2C arena is one of the fastest-growing segments in India, as per an  Inc42  report . However, many of these businesses are new, therefore customers face a hard time discovering and trusting these new D2C brands.  Furrl , established in 2022 by IIT Kanpur and Harvard Business School alumna Esha Tiwary, provides a platform for D2C brands to showcase their products and sell them to customers. Furrl\u2019s handpicked selection of brands undergoes a rigorous vetting process, ensuring that only authentic and high-quality brands make it onto the platform. This curation sets the startup apart from traditional ecommerce marketplaces, offering a more personalised and discerning shopping experience.\u00a0 Further, Furrl offers a seamless one-click ordering system, comprehensive product information, and hassle-free returns and exchanges. Consumers can browse through a diverse range of categories, from fashion and accessories to home d\u00e9cor and lifestyle products, all curated to cater to the tastes of discerning shoppers. Furrl monetises its platform via two channels \u2013 earning a commission on each sale made through its platform and allowing brands to pay to have their products prominently featured on its homepage or within specific categories. For large-scale food production, testing remains an important final step before any food shipment goes out. However, the process of manual food testing also does not detect adulterants beyond a certain point. To solve this, ex-Snapdeal research engineers Shweta Gupta and Abhishek Goyal founded  ImagoAI  in 2019. The startup claims to have developed the world\u2019s fastest non-destructive food test \u2013 Galaxy. The test uses hyperspectral imaging and AI to detect mycotoxins, pathogens, vitamins, proteins, and other micronutrients in food.\u00a0 ImagoAI combines digital imaging with spectroscopy to give 3D imaging. Further, the startup\u2019s proprietary AI micro models use each pixel\u2019s spectral bands as a chemical signature. They extract features from each chemical signature and these extracted features are fed into its AI to generate test results in seconds. ImagoAI claims to serve multiple Fortune 500 food companies and monetises its products through direct sales. Even though India has the largest number of stock market traders in the world, a significant chunk of them do not possess the know-how to make informed trading decisions. This is probably why many end up losing a lot of money in the market.\u00a0 Acknowledging this, seasoned stock market investors Rohit Srivastava and Chavan Krishna founded  IndiaCharts  in 2022. The startup offers analytics on India\u2019s stock markets via its platform  STRIKE . The platform provides data visualisation to easily spot trends and allows scanning and searching of data with predefined setups and analysis of trends and sentiment. Indiacharts provides subscribers with daily, weekly, and monthly updates on the stock market, including analysis of Nifty50, Bank Nifty, commodities, currencies, individual stocks, and Indian and global economic trends. The startup also offers a mentorship programme and a discussion forum, enabling users to become better traders. STRIKE is currently being offered for free by Indiacharts, with the startup planning to launch the paid version by 2024. In the long term, Indiacharts wants to throw open its platform to the world. It plans to foray into the US and European markets by 2026. While India has generated several multimillion-dollar manufacturing enterprises, a significant portion of them are highly localised and do not look outside their local markets, let alone the country, for prospective buyers. Though many Indian brands have global ambitions, a lack of connections to global buyers is often their undoing. Founded in 2023 by IIT Kharagpur alumni Rajiv Patki and Sambuddha Adhikari,  Jodaro  provides global commerce solutions to manufacturers. The startup specialises in identifying supply gaps across geographies and automating global commerce operations. Jodaro\u2019s core product includes four key elements \u2013 storefront management, inventory management, global logistics and marketing and social media management. The startup also allows manufacturers to build an omnichannel presence globally, enabling them to sell efficiently across both online and offline sales channels. It offers its products via a SaaS-based revenue model, with custom-built plans for each customer. By 2026, Jodaro envisions expanding operations to 10 global markets, collaborating with over 500 manufacturers, and curating 15,000 diverse products. India\u2019s banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector is often characterised by inefficiencies. Even though this sector is considered to be the backbone of the economy, technology adoption has been slow in this space. Bengaluru-based  OnFinance  envisions a future where Gen AI can revolutionise the BFSI sector. Founded in 2022 by Anuj Srivastava and Priyesh Srivastava, the startup is committed to leveraging the power of Gen AI to deliver solutions that enhance efficiency, productivity and customer experience for BFSI institutions. At OnFinance AI\u2019s core is NeoGPT, an in-house LLM, tailored for the BFSI domain. NeoGPT can understand and generate human-quality text, translate languages, craft creative content, and respond to questions.\u00a0 The startup has developed AI copilots, which integrate with existing BFSI workflows to support internal teams across various functions such as research, relationship management, sales and customer support. It offers custom AI solutions and provides consultation services to assist BFSI companies in seamlessly integrating the startup\u2019s AI solutions into its existing infrastructure and processes. Even though new-age industries like electric vehicles (EVs) and drones are growing at a break-neck speed, companies working in these areas continue to be bogged down in supply chain issues.\u00a0 Seamless sourcing of complex machinery, components and technology is the need of the hour for sustained growth of these burgeoning industries. Founded by Ninad Kashid in December 2020,  Procurabl  does exactly this. The startup unclogs supply chain bottlenecks with its solutions. Drawing on his experience as a founding team member at a battery pack manufacturing startup, Kashid navigated the intricacies and risks associated with establishing supply chains for the EV industry. The company offers end-to-end supply chain solutions for powertrain, electric drive systems, chassis assemblies, and their components. Procurabl claims to have an impressive 98% perfect order rate for its powertrain supply chain solutions. The business model also includes engaging in local manufacturing projects with Indian MSMEs. Revenue is generated through a project/milestone-based model. Procurabl collaborates with OEMs, offering contract manufacturing, white-labelling, and standardised part sourcing tailored to the specific needs of its clients.\u00a0 The startup positions itself as a strategic partner in addressing challenges faced by OEMs in areas like optimising projects for enhanced visibility, reducing time-to-market, and cost management. Procurabl aims to propel its business growth by 10X by next year. In the medium term (by 2026), the startup has plans to collaborate with over 100 OEMs in five countries. Founded by Akhil Jayaprakash in 2019,  Pulse Energy  is a SaaS platform dedicated to enhancing energy systems. The company\u2019s primary offerings comprise a charger management solution designed for operators overseeing chargers remotely.\u00a0 Additionally, there is a fleet EV charger management product, enabling seamless access and payment for EV fleets at charging stations nationwide. Catering to EV OEMs, Pulse Energy provides a charger interoperability product, facilitating access and payment at any charger across India. Central to Pulse Energy\u2019s ecosystem is its \u201cEV Charger Marketplace\u201d, a one-stop solution for EV fleets, OEMs, and charge point operators. Through this platform, EV fleets and OEMs gain easy access to chargers, while operators increase charger utilisation by listing on the marketplace.\u00a0 Its D2C charging app, InstaCharge, directly serves EV drivers, enabling them to locate, access, and pay for public chargers. Billing is structured on a per-energy-dispensed basis, creating a revenue stream for Pulse Energy. A significant achievement for Pulse Energy has been the onboarding of Uber Green, with approximately 80% of Uber Green cabs now relying on Pulse Energy\u2019s EV charging platform for hub and public charging.\u00a0 The company aims to expand its market share by leveraging partnerships with renowned brands like Moeving, Everest Fleet (Uber Green), Log9, and Tork Motors. In the long term, the startup aims to extend services to individual EV users. Despite major advancements in the field of software development, India\u2019s hospitality industry has often found itself tethered to outdated software. This is precisely where  Quoality , founded in 2022 by Akshay Dekate and Tejaswi Chawla, steps in to fill the gap in the Indian hospitality sector. The startup offers an all-in-one guest experience platform, addressing the need to digitise guest-facing processes. The startup offers a cloud-native platform that simplifies operations for hoteliers.\u00a0 One of the key features of the Quoality platform includes guest messaging, which automates communication through channels like WhatsApp and email. Further, its \u2018ancillary upsell\u2019 functionality offers additional services to guests, maximising revenue streams. Quoality also offers contactless check-in and checkout, reducing wait times. The platform\u2019s payments feature allows hotels to collect ancillary sales and other payments online, mitigating revenue pilferage. Quoality\u2019s subscription-based pricing model includes the base platform and communication credits. As of now, the platform is active across 5,500 rooms, with ambitious plans to expand to 20,000-25,000 rooms by the end of 2024. The startup claims to have onboarded prominent players in the USA and Middle East markets, with recent collaborations including Choice Hotels India. India is one of the world\u2019s most adversely affected countries when it comes to cyberattacks. A  recent report  by Singapore-based cybersecurity firm Cyfirma shows that India is the most-targeted nation globally in state-sponsored cyberattacks, with 13.7% of all global state-sponsored attacks aimed at India. To combat this, Hyderabad-based SecurWeave is building cybersecurity solutions for the future. The startup develops hardware-enforced security solutions to protect against advanced malware attacks. Its flagship product, CHESS (configurable hardware-enforced safety & security), is a platform that can be integrated into various devices, including endpoints, mobile phones, data centres and embedded systems.\u00a0 CHESS works by using hardware extensions to monitor and control the execution of software, preventing malicious code from gaining access to sensitive data and systems. The startup is collaborating with Intel to improve its advanced malware detection capabilities and protect operating systems from malware attacks. Another focus area for SecurWeave is to leverage its collaboration with Intel to provide security for the Industrial IoT (IIoT) segment. The firm monetises its platform through strategic partnerships with device manufacturers and software vendors. By integrating CHESS into their products and solutions, these partners gain a competitive edge by offering enhanced security to their customers.\u00a0 Indian companies working with overseas clients often face challenges related to remittances and receiving payments due to complications with setting up a FEMA-compliant system. Founded in February 2022 by Movin Jain and Srivatsan Sridhar, Skydo is a fintech startup that aims to simplify cross-border B2B payments by enabling businesses to create a global virtual account within five minutes. Skydo\u2019s platform facilitates invoicing, payments, and accounts receivable. By partnering with leading global banks, it offers businesses their foreign virtual accounts for receiving payments, eliminating taxation and compliance burdens. Currently serving 750+ Indian businesses and exporters, Skydo claims to have witnessed a robust month-on-month growth rate of 25%, processing over $11 Mn in forex payments since its launch. The company aims to reach 2 Lakh small businesses, targeting $1 Bn in export payment flows over the next year. Plans include providing financing options, introducing payout cards and offering treasury services to facilitate multi-currency payments, signalling a strategic approach to secure a strong foothold in the market. ESG reporting is one of the most important undertakings an enterprise engages in, second only to financial reporting in many instances. However, the lack of standardised reporting within the segment has led to much debate about the true performance of a given enterprise during a given time, and the arbitrary and subjective nature of ESG data can also be challenging. Several startups are emerging to revolutionise ESG reporting for enterprises and Bengaluru-based  StepChange  is one of them.  Founded in 2021 by ex-Ola executive Ankit Jain and MIT alumnus Sidhant Pai, PhD, StepChange offers a one-stop solution for enterprise sustainability, ESG reporting, financed emissions, portfolio climate risk management and product sustainability. The startup\u2019s software is employed by banks, asset managers, insurance companies, and corporations to measure their ESG performance, track progress towards their ESG goals, report ESG performance to stakeholders, identify and manage ESG risks and develop and implement ESG strategies. StepChange\u2019s software is based on the latest ESG standards and frameworks, including the GHG Protocol, the TCFD, and the SASB. The company\u2019s software is also cloud-based and easy to use. The startup monetises its software through a subscription-based pricing model. Businesses can choose from various subscription plans that fit their specific needs. StepChange also offers a host of consulting and advisory services to help businesses implement and optimise their ESG programmes. In the AI universe, LLMs have emerged as powerful tools capable of generating text, translating languages and creating various types of creative content. However, using these models effectively hinges on the ability to craft effective prompts. Sugarcane AI , founded in 2023 by NIT graduates Ravinder Kumar and Ankur Agarwal, addresses this challenge by introducing an open-source node package manager-like package ecosystem, specifically designed for prompts. In simple words, the platform enables developers to create, package and share prompt packages, akin to reusable modules that encapsulate prompt templates, datasets and LLM configurations. The startup offers four components \u2013 Sugar Factory (a no-code playground for prompt developers to build and share prompts), Sugar Hub (a marketplace where developers can discover and access prompt packages), Sugar Bakery (a software development kit that simplifies the integration of LLMs into applications) and Sugar Farm (a tool for data scientists to streamline the process of building and training Micro LLMs). Sugarcane AI monetises the platform through the sales of prompt packages on Sugar Hub, through subscriptions for Sugar Factory, Sugar Bakery and Sugar Farm, as well as support from the community. Managing expenses can be a daunting task, often consuming valuable time and susceptible to errors. Despite the availability of numerous spending management tools, a persistent gap appears to exist. Moreover, entrusting third-party apps with access may jeopardise the security of personal data. After witnessing this issue first-hand, Rajkumar Desai launched  Surplus , a full-stack expense management platform, in 2021. The Mumbai-based startup helps users track their expenses, optimise spending and make informed financial decisions. The platform links with users\u2019 bank accounts to offer features such as expense tracking, personalised insights and a live budget tracker. Surplus also enables users to buy and manage their subscriptions, providing discounts and trial packs based on their spending patterns.\u00a0 On the B2B side, the startup collaborates with brands to offer discounts, exclusive deals and more. Surplus claims that it enables companies to reduce their Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and target the right niche of users. The app also allows companies to pay based on the performance of their campaigns instead of a blanket fee. The startup operates on a B2B2C model and has two revenue streams \u2013\u00a0 transaction fees and other related charges from B2B customers and a subscription fee from B2C users. Currently, the startup is working on rolling out its app on the Google Play Store and Apple\u2019s App Store. Founded in 2021 by Bhaavan Ramani,  Swashaa  has forged a distinct path in the fashion industry after learning from the collapse of a previous business. This close-knit team of friends and family has crafted a brand that offers stainless steel jewellery, offering unique design, affordability, and quality. Its flagship products include the Shiny Clover Necklace and Bree Band Bracelet, which embody the brand\u2019s ethos. Swashaa\u2019s working model revolves around meticulous product management, media, and marketing strategies. The team curates products backed by a robust media and marketing plan executed by an in-house team of photographers, videographers, and influencers. The post-order process, managed by the CRM team, ensures swift communication and resolution, coupled with efficient shipping through selected partners. Swashaa\u2019s revenue model focuses on direct sales and an advertising model, while strategic decisions like eliminating local vendors and introducing leather handbags showcase a commitment to innovation. The brand\u2019s expansion plan includes the launch of stores at domestic airports and a targeted entry into international markets, with a keen eye on the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. While millions of people in India invest in public markets, they require greater access to new-age investment vehicles and crucial insights that could contribute to their success on the bourses. Founded in 2022 by Pranit Arora, Avneet Dhamija and Vikash Agrawal,  Univest  is a mobile app that offers investors a suite of investment solutions. It provides users with personalised investment recommendations based on their risk tolerance and financial goals.\u00a0 The app features AI-powered \u2018Buy/Sell/Hold\u2019 insights, advanced screeners and daily pre-market analysis. Additionally, it provides financial news and educational resources to assist users in making informed investment decisions. The startup generates revenue through a combination of transaction and subscription fees. For each investment transaction initiated through the platform, Univest charges a small commission. Additionally, the company offers a premium subscription service that gives users access to in-depth research reports and personalised investment guidance. Indian expatriates constitute one of the primary contributors to foreign remittances flowing into India. Goldman Sachs  estimates  net inward remittances to India to hover around the $104 Bn mark in calendar year 2023. Despite this, there are several challenges NRIs face while transferring money home. Founded in 2022 by Stanford dropout Parth Garg, Bengaluru-based  Vance  is a neobank that streamlines remitting money to India from foreign lands. The startup also provides access to a free international debit card while enabling NRIs to invest in Indian stocks and mutual funds. Vance charges a flat fee regardless of the transaction size. For instance, the startup charges \u00a33 per transaction from the UK to India, regardless of the amount. The startup also offers NRE NRE (non-resident external), NRO (non-resident ordinary), and FCNR (foreign currency non-resident) accounts, allowing Indians living abroad access to the Indian banking systems. The startup claims to have nearly 50K users across the US, the UK, Singapore, the UAE and Canada. While proficiency in coding and programming is crucial for developing customised apps and workflows, a significant number of companies entering the technological landscape lack individuals with the requisite technical expertise to create applications from the ground up. This concern has grown exponentially in light of the escalating demand for applications. Founded in 2022 by Sagnik Ghosh and Susmita Ghosh,  WorqHat  is a no-code platform that empowers companies to construct enterprise-grade web applications without coding. The platform, inspired by Photoshop\u2019s user-friendly interface, guides users through a conversational journey of crafting data, components and security features. WorqHat has developed in-house LLMs tailored to enterprise data, thereby enhancing the platform\u2019s capabilities. The Pune-based startup enables companies to design bespoke applications for various departments, including sales, marketing, finance, operations and more. Adopting a subscription-based monetisation strategy, WorqHat provides businesses with tiered pricing plans that cater to their specific requirements and usage patterns. This approach ensures a flexible and scalable solution for companies seeking to meet their diverse application development needs. While India\u2019s last-mile logistics services have made significant progress over the past decade, challenges persist, with issues such as products being damaged or stolen during the delivery process. Enter Kiran Shivappa and Ravindra Nayaka, who founded  Xobox  in 2021, a startup that addresses these concerns by offering smart IoT lockers made of durable MS material. Xobox manages the entire process, from in-house designing and manufacturing of printed circuit boards to outsourcing the fabrication of metal lockers.\u00a0 With a focus on large apartment complexes, Xobox offers an end-to-end solution, and residents can opt to have their packages securely stored in the smart lockers, with the convenience of self-checkout or assistance from Xobox\u2019s dedicated personnel, XMEN. The service aims to benefit elderly residents by reducing traffic within gated communities and instilling a sense of security. Xobox\u2019s business model includes charging residents a nominal fee per transaction and providing an efficient and secure delivery process. In addition to its primary focus on delivery services, Xobox empowers women entrepreneurs by enabling them to provide logistics services within the community for a reasonable fee. With a successful pilot programme at a 1,650-flat community and 6,000 customers, Xobox aims to replicate its model in 30 societies by the end of 2024. Edited by Shishir Parashar.",

        "Article Content": "The year 2023 was one of the most important crucible moments for the Indian startup ecosystem in recent memory, filled with regulatory challenges, record-low funding influx and many, many more problems. For some context, Indian startups had only managed to secure around $10 Bn in funding until December 25, 2023, according to Inc42\u2019s \u2018 Indian Tech Startup Funding Report 2023 \u2019, as wary investors refrained from fuelling break-neck growth. The scarcity of funding was such that Indian startups had raised $12 Bn in 2018 \u2013 three years before the paradigm-shattering year of 2021. As Indian startups adapted to the \u2018new normal\u2019 of massive funding shortfalls fueled by prolonged negative investor sentiment, there were questions about whether the up-and-coming startups in India would survive in an ecosystem more and more driven by a Darwinian environment, in which only the leanest and fittest companies would survive. Even so, we were able to identify and celebrate 210 early stage startups during the year, which we covered across seven editions of  30 Startups To Watch . As we usher in 2024 with our 43rd edition of  30 Startups To Watch , we remain committed to the cause of discovering more Indian startups that we believe have the potential to take up the mantle of the next big thing. In this edition, we have selected startups from a broad array of sectors, going from the \u2018traditional\u2019 startup segments of fintech, ecommerce and enterprise tech to new disruptors such as GenAI, electric vehicles and cleantech. What sets this cohort apart is that more than 70% of the featured startups have secured funding below $2 Mn.\u00a0 Further, keeping in line with the trend we observed towards the end of last year, a significant portion of the 43rd cohort of 30 Startups To Watch is bootstrapped, signalling in no uncertain words that raising funding is secondary to driving innovation for a startup. Continuing our tradition of identifying some of the most pathbreaking startups every month, we bring you 30 startups that caught our attention this January. Editor\u2019s Note: The list below is not a ranking of any kind. We have listed the startups alphabetically. Founded by IIT Kanpur and ISB alumnus Prashant Trivedi and Mayo Clinic-trained Critical Care Physician Dr. Lokendra Thakur in early 2023,  Aarogya Tech  offers clinician-led, data-based personalised health management solutions tailored for home and community settings.\u00a0 The startup\u2019s primary goal is to enhance population health, improve quality of life, and extend longevity by focussing on disease prevention and early diagnosis. Aarogya Tech\u2019s vision revolves around democratising healthcare by providing accessible, intelligent health companionship.\u00a0 Its approach emphasises affordability, data-driven insights, and the expertise of clinicians, thereby shifting the focus of healthcare from traditional hospital settings to the comfort of individuals\u2019 homes and communities. In just a year of operation, Aarogya Tech has achieved significant milestones. It has developed a disease-specific patient monitoring system aimed at reducing chronic heart failure readmission rates to combat prevalent health challenges. Additionally, the Bengaluru-based startup launched DocSeva.com, a personalised health management platform catering to over 10 businesses in Bengaluru. The voluntary carbon offset market is predicted to become a $250 Bn market opportunity by 2050. Founded by Shrey Agarwal in 2023,  Alt Carbon  aims to meet this demand by focussing on permanent sequestration.\u00a0 Founded with a personal connection to the challenges faced by Darjeeling\u2019s tea industry due to climate change, ALT Carbon is on a mission to make a significant impact on global carbon removal goals.

With the rise in online sales of new smartphones, there\u2019s a growing trend among consumers to trade in their devices, thereby bolstering the supply in secondary markets. As such, despite its unorganised nature, India\u2019s refurbished phone market commands an estimated worth of  nearly $4 Bn .\u00a0 Founded by Yug Bhatia,  ControlZ  specialises in the component-level renewal of pre-owned devices.

The startup\u2019s long-term vision involves turning into a globally recognised brand while also extending its services to individual store consumers, thereby expanding the market presence. In India, the business of faith is booming, and startups in the field of spiritual tech are thriving. This is because the Indian devotional market is estimated to be a $50 Bn market opportunity. \u00a0 To cash in on highly unorganised space, IIT graduates Pranav Kapoor, Suyash Taneja, and Sagnika Chowdhury founded  DevDham , formerly DevDarshan, in 2020.\u00a0 The startup helps to connect devotees with temples through its app. It leverages tech to provide online daily darshan, conduct pujas, and facilitate digital donations.

Yet, there are no reliable ways to verify these assertions, which led to the creation of  Herby Angel . Founded in 2023, the startup the startup provides organic, ayurveda-based holistic wellness products for babies and kids.

Leveraging a comprehensive and expertly curated agriculture knowledge base, coupled with a vertical LLM, KissanAI\u2019s AgriCopilot platform delivers customised information to address a wide range of challenges encountered by farmers daily. Over the last decade, the significance of user experience (UX) has surged across businesses. Consequently, front-end development has grown in complexity, leading to heightened demand. Despite this, developers find themselves spending a lot of time on procedural tasks such as styling (CSS), managing the document object model (HTML), and dealing with framework-specific boilerplate. Founded by Dipanjan Dey and Abhjit Bhole in 2022, frontend devtool startup Kombai aims to alleviate this burden by helping developers streamline these repetitive tasks. By simply prompting Kombai with design files, developers can get production-quality user interface (UI) code with just one click per component. This code can then be easily downloaded, modified in any way, and incorporated into their codebases. Kombai is currently accessible for free in the public research preview phase. The startup simplifies UI code creation with a step-by-step approach, intelligently organising elements into a streamlined div structure with minimal hardcoded CSS. It segments code into clear components for easy understanding and potential reuse, replacing static text with variables based on identified patterns. Kombai enhances the code further using publicly available LLMs for refinement, resulting in a polished end product. The problem of deepfakes revolves around manipulating audio, images, or videos to create highly realistic yet fake content, leading to widespread misinformation, identity theft, privacy violations, and reputational damage. The problem has only been exacerbated ever since the rise of large diffusion and large vision models, which have made generating deepfakes far more easier and accessible. Kroop AI offers a platform for responsible and ethical synthetic data. Its multimodal detection platform ViZMantiZ is a deepfake detector for images and videos. Another product, Artiste AI Studio, is a web app and API for synthetic data generation from avatars in different languages. ViZMantiZ specialises in sub-continent data-based deepfake detection, and it can cater to the rich diversity. The startup plans to expand beyond India to the APAC region this year while integrating deepfake detection technology into KYC settings and social media platforms. Kusho  was founded in 2023 by BITS Pilani alumni Abhishek Saikia and Sourabh Gawande. The startup is building AI agents that harness the power of LLMs (Large Language Models) to ensure that the code is tested during development and with every new release. Kusho uses proprietary models coupled with foundational LLMs to simulate an AI software developer that can discover bugs in code with significantly greater accuracy and in a fraction of the time compared to a human software developer. Furthermore, KushoAI helps engineering teams set up API test automation with a single click. It helps you generate tests, execute them, and get analysed results for your entire codebase in sync with your CI/CD pipeline. KushoAI writes and executes functional tests for REST APIs, allowing teams to ship quickly without worrying about overlooked edge cases that could cause issues in production. By utilising inputs such as Postman collections, OpenAPI specs, or API information, KushoAI generates comprehensive tests that can be seamlessly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline via GitHub actions or executed locally. This approach streamlines the process of issue discovery, eliminating the need for manual test creation and easing the burden on development teams. KushoAI is currently available to individual users at no cost. However, for enterprise users, it operates on a usage-based billing model. After its launch in January 2024, KushoAI has rapidly expanded its user base, with hundreds of users spanning the globe. It wants to scale the enterprise offering in the US and EU regions this year. Additionally, the aim is to automate the backend testing process entirely, providing a user experience akin to interacting with a self-driving car. Looking ahead to 2026, KushoAI aims to develop a comprehensive platform for software engineering teams so that they can serve as a one-stop solution for all testing and repair processes.

        "Article Content": "The year 2023 tested the limits of the world\u2019s third-largest startup ecosystem. Faced with regulatory hurdles and dwindling funding numbers, Indian new-age tech companies navigated a terrain fraught with uncertainty. Unfortunately, little has changed despite stepping into the financial year 2024-25 (FY25). As per Inc42, funding raised by Indian startups receded to a seven-year low, falling 33% year-on-year (YoY) to $2 Bn in Q1 2024. Further, the first week of April 2024 (between April 1 and 6) saw a week-on-week (WoW) decline of 38% in funding. Similar was the trend towards the end of the month when the startup funding was down 33% WoW. The repercussions of this funding winter continue to reverberate throughout the ecosystem, prompting a fundamental shift in focus towards sustainability. However, on the positive side, the vagaries of this two-year-long capital drought have not dampened the innovative spirit of the Indian startup landscape. Lately, we have witnessed that the Indian startup ecosystem is experiencing a surge in early stage cleantech ventures, reflecting a collective commitment towards environmental stewardship. Alongside this, a diverse array of ventures spanning sectors such as direct-to-consumer (D2C), agritech, and AI are contributing towards the spirit of disruption pulsating within the ecosystem. But, what truly sets Indian founders apart is their unwavering focus on creating value rather than raising funds. This is probably what is keeping Indian startups going despite the gloom. Against this backdrop, we are happy to present the 46th edition of \u2018 30 Startups to Watch \u2018 \u2014 Startups That Caught Our Eyes In April. This latest edition is also the first edition of FY25. Imperative to note that we gave the March edition of \u201830 Startups to Watch\u2019 a conscious miss as the whole of the Indian Startup ecosystem was busy concluding FY24. With that said, here is the full list of the startups that caught our eyes in April 2024. (Editor\u2019s Note: The list below is not a ranking of any kind. We have listed the startups alphabetically.) Founded by Priyanka Gera and Piyush Kateja,  Aeria  is transforming traditional office spaces with technology and AI.

        "Article Content": "Even as North India seethed under the sweltering sun, the capital-starved Indian startup ecosystem witnessed a pleasant June 2024 as funding levels recovered to some extent on the back of Zepto\u2019s $665 Mn funding round.\u00a0 While the shoots of funding revival brought some respite, the road to recovery, in terms of funding numbers, still seems far.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the freefall in funding raised by Indian startups in the past one year, the world\u2019s third-largest startup landscape is slowly climbing its way up, as investor confidence is coming back stronger than a \u201990s trend. Leading the charge of this turnaround from the front is the GenAI boom in the country, which has enticed both global and domestic VC and PE firms. Coupled with the emerging arena of cleantech and ever-growing direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands in the country, the Indian startup landscape appears well-poised to fuel the next stage of growth.\u00a0 However, profitability and sustainability still seem to be high on the agenda of investors. The 48th batch of  \u201830 Startups To Watch\u2019  is suggestive of the trend \u2013 nine bootstrapped startups, yet the whole cohort has raised around $30 Mn between them. What\u2019s more, half of this month\u2019s batch has raised more than $1 Mn in funding. The June 2024 edition of \u201830 Startups To Watch\u2019 is more mainstream than recent cohorts, with over 75% of the startups coming from India\u2019s three major startup hubs: Bengaluru (13), Mumbai (6), and Delhi NCR (5).\u00a0 However, Pune and Ahmedabad also left their mark and incubated a clutch of new-age tech companies featured on the list.\u00a0 As we close the first half of 2024, we continue to keep an eye on some of the most interesting ventures nestling in India\u2019s startup ecosystem. Without further ado, here is the 48th edition of Inc42\u2019s \u201830 Startups To Watch\u2019. Editor\u2019s Note: The list below is not a ranking of any kind. We have listed the startups alphabetically. To address the credit gap in India and similar challenges in emerging economies, Utkarsh Apoorva, Harshad Saykhedkar, Ashwini Prabhu, and Anubhab Bandyopadhyay launched  AbleCredit  in 2023. The startup is developing GenAI models to transform the underwriting process by generating detailed and tailored credit reports on a case-by-case basis. The uniqueness of AbleCredit\u2019s approach lies in its ability to assess creditworthiness within the informal sector. By analysing alternative data and adhering to stringent credit policies and guidelines, AbleCredit expands access to credit assessment for sectors typically overlooked by conventional methods. By enhancing the speed of underwriting by over 20X and reducing operational costs, the platform enables credit teams to significantly increase their throughput. A team that previously handled 10 loan cases per day can now manage over 120 cases efficiently. This efficiency accelerates the credit approval process and reduces the high underwriting costs that have historically hindered credit access in emerging markets. In essence, AbleCredit\u2019s innovative AI-driven approach is poised to bridge the credit gap in emerging nations, particularly in sectors like MSMEs where access to credit is critical for economic growth and job creation. The rise of direct-to-consumer (D2C) beauty brands in India has transformed the skincare industry with innovative solutions. One of these new brands is  Asaya , a premium skincare line specifically designed for melanin-rich skin. Launched in September 2023 by Neeraj Biyani, the cofounder of Paper Boat, along with Mandeep Bhatia and Eeti Sharma, Asaya has quickly made a mark in the market. Asaya\u2019s journey began when cofounder Sharma, at the age of 35, woke up with adult acne. Despite seeking expert advice and trying European products, Sharma found no relief. She realised that her dusky skin\u2019s specific needs were missing from the skincare conversation and product formulations. This insight led to the creation of Asaya, which focusses on deep hydration for hyperpigmentation, acne, lower moisture retention, oily skin care, and other specific needs of melanin-rich skin. Asaya has rapidly expanded its sales and customer base, selling through its website and major online platforms like Nykaa, Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.

        "Article Content": "When you ask most graduates today about their first job opportunity, many will quickly tell you it was at a startup. To put things in perspective, India was home to over 1.4 Lakh Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)-recognised startups as of June 2024, up from 92,683 in February 2023.\u00a0 This surge reflects the rapid growth of India\u2019s startup ecosystem since the launch of the Startup India initiative in 2016. India\u2019s economy has seen the proliferation of startups across key sectors such as technology and ecommerce. These young companies have become a cornerstone of economic development. The recognition of 1,40,803 startups by the end of June 2024 underscores the dynamic nature of the Indian startup ecosystem, which has created over 15.5 Lakh direct jobs and spans 80% of the districts in the country. Even though ecommerce, enterprise tech, and fintech continue their run as the leading sectors, deeptech has slowly emerged as a bright spot within the Indian startup landscape, attracting increased investor interest and funding deals last year. In this backdrop, the pressing question remains: What is being done to embolden students to take their entrepreneurial skills to the next level? Higher educational institutions are increasingly establishing technology business incubators (TBIs) to foster a culture of entrepreneurship among students. These incubators provide a supportive environment where budding entrepreneurs can transform their innovative ideas into viable businesses.\u00a0 Many of these  incubators  offer a variety of resources, including state-of-the-art labs, dedicated workspaces, and access to expert mentorship, helping students gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies. Moreover, incubators also collaborate with corporate partners to extend their impact and help link academia with industry to create a robust  startup ecosystem . The success of such initiatives is evident in the number of startups incubated and mentored, showcasing the incubator\u2019s role in nurturing innovation and entrepreneurship. Another effective strategy employed by higher education institutions to spur entrepreneurship is to integrate business-related courses and modules into the standard curriculum. These programs are designed to blend theoretical knowledge with practical skills, preparing students to navigate the complexities of the business world.\u00a0 Courses often include subjects like business planning, financial management, marketing strategies, and innovation management. By incorporating case studies, project-based learning, and real-world problem-solving activities, students can develop a holistic understanding of what it takes to build and sustain a successful startup. These programmes often invite industry professionals and successful entrepreneurs to share their insights and experiences, bridging the gap between classroom learning and real-world application. This approach not only enhances students\u2019 skills but also instils a mindset geared towards innovation and resilience \u2013 essential traits for any aspiring entrepreneur. Access to funding is a critical component of a startup\u2019s success. Educational institutions are increasingly recognising this need and are stepping up to provide various funding opportunities and resources to their students.\u00a0 This includes seed funding, grants, and soft loans tailored to support early-stage startups. Additionally, many institutions partner with government bodies and private sector players to offer comprehensive financial support packages. For example, government schemes like the National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI), Start up India Seed Fund,\u00a0 TIDE 2.0, among others offer significant grants and seed funding to promote young and aspiring innovators.\u00a0 By offering financial assistance, these institutions enable students to create a prototype of their ideas, conduct research, and eventually bring their products to the market. Such support systems are crucial for reducing the financial barriers that often hinder the progress of student entrepreneurs. Higher educational institutions play a pivotal role in shaping the entrepreneurial landscape by fostering innovation and providing practical exposure to students. Through initiatives like incubator programs, these institutions offer a robust platform for first-generation entrepreneurs to transform their ideas into viable businesses.\u00a0 By providing state-of-the-art facilities and expert mentorship, they create an ecosystem where students can experiment, learn, and grow. This support extends beyond mere academic training, emphasising real-world applications and industry collaborations to ensure that students are not only job-ready but also equipped to create jobs and drive economic growth.\u00a0 These incubation programs, supported by government and private sector partnerships, illustrate the significant strides educational institutions are making to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and entrepreneurial success \u2013 setting the stage for the next generation of global startup leaders out of India.",

        "Article Content": "If there were a poll to determine the most influential HR buzzword of 2024, the clear frontrunner would be \u2018skills\u2019. Traditional hiring methods are being replaced by skill-based hiring, a more inclusive and flexible strategy that puts candidates\u2019 abilities ahead of their experience, as the labour market continues to evolve.\u00a0 This proactive trend is altering the future of recruitment and goes beyond simply adapting to the needs of companies in an ever-changing business environment. \n A remarkable 81% of businesses have adopted some kind of skill-based hiring in 2024, up from 73% in 2023 and 56% in 2022, according to  TestGorilla\u2019s The State of Skill-Based Hiring 2024 Report .\u00a0 It is evident that skill-based recruiting is here to stay, as indicated by the 95% of the respondents who saw it as the future\u2019s dominating recruitment  trend  as more and more employers try out a more expansive hiring approach, which focuses more on the skills possessed by a candidate. Instead of focusing only on traditional credentials like years of experience or academic degrees, skill-based hiring considers the particular abilities, knowledge, and competencies a candidate possesses. This strategy aims to improve inclusivity and aligns it more closely with the needs of the modern digital-first economy. Companies can now attract a more varied pool of candidates by emphasising abilities over academic records as many of these candidates may have gained their talents through unconventional means like self-directed learning, online courses, or real-world experience.\u00a0 This change in emphasis guarantees that companies are able to access a larger talent pool while also democratising the hiring process. Skill-based hiring has potential to bridge the gap between recruitment and career advancement. Here\u2019s how: Skill-based hiring means that workers are more likely to perform well in their positions and create happier workplaces. Employee retention rates are much higher when workers feel appreciated and content, as this increases their likelihood of sticking with the organisation. The stability of the company benefits from this continuity as well as the professional advancement of the staff. Companies can find internal candidates for promotions or lateral transfers more quickly by focussing on abilities rather than job titles or tenure. By enabling workers to move into new positions where their talents are most needed and where they may further their professional development, this strategy promotes career advancement.\u00a0 Employing people based on their skills motivates businesses to spend money on retraining and upskilling their employees.  Employees benefit  from this investment by staying up to date on industry trends and are better equipped for roles they will play in the future within the organisation. Employees can progress in their careers by applying for more advanced roles as they gain new abilities. Employers can expect that new hires can contribute right away to important projects and initiatives when they make hiring decisions based on specific talents. Productivity and innovation are increased when employee talents and business needs are in line. When workers prove themselves, they may be given more responsibility, which can help them develop their careers faster with higher productivity. Employing people based on their skills encourages diversity since it values a variety of backgrounds and career trajectories. Companies may promote a more inclusive workplace where all employees have the opportunity to progress based on their abilities and contributions by removing restrictions that traditional hiring procedures frequently impose. To maximise the benefits of skill-based hiring, companies need to adapt to modern hiring practices. \n Thus, skill-based hiring creates a more flexible, competent, and driven staff, which closes the gap between hiring and career advancement. It gives workers more chances to develop and flourish, which eventually results in a more engaged and effective workplace. The  future of work  will be characterised by a more inclusive and skill-centric paradigm as more businesses adopt this strategy to improve profit.",

        "Article Content": "To date, the central government has built  31 innovation centers, 15 startup centers, 15 technology business  incubators , 7 research parks, and 500 Atal Tinkering Labs. The StartUpIndia initiative has enabled INR 960 Cr of funding for startups. Still, 80-90% of startups fail, many of which are because of  lack of funding. This is especially true in deeptech, where commercial viability is equally vital as it is difficult to assess. 70% of Indian deeptech startups cited funding to scale as their biggest challenge. Long gestation periods create costly uncertainty, and reluctant capital at commercialisation becomes the most common reason for failure.  Government funding has historically been necessary to fill the gaps. After all, public funding created the original lithium-ion batteries long before enabling the smartphone revolution. The US government\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) developed the GPS system. Yet, venture capital gets scared when government procurement is fundamental to a startup\u2019s value proposition. Bureaucracy, the traditional wisdom follows, is notoriously difficult to navigate, and funds are limited. In India, R&D spending is just 0.7% of GDP.\u00a0 However, that may be changing in India. Why? We now recognise the role domestic innovation has to play in building smart cities, modernising public transportation, and integrating clean technologies into infrastructure, among other endeavors. Today, the government is expanding its capacity as a first market for deeptech products with public uses, answering the all-important question of many deeptech startups: \u201cWho will we sell to?\u201d startups and VCs would be wise to recognise the moment accordingly.\u00a0 Take note of the defense industry. iDEX, established in 2018, aims to increase Indian self-dependence in defense. The program empowers an ecosystem of technologists and innovators making products for the Indian military, expected to spend INR 1.5 lakh Cr (about $18 Bn) a year until 2030 modernising itself. iDEX issues problem statements\u2013pertaining to cyber security to arms transportation\u2013and offers up to INR 10 Cr to winning pitches.  The programme then collaborates with founders, providing infrastructure and support services, and acts as a first market for the product. NewSpace Research and Technologies, an unmanned aerial vehicle innovator, and EyeROV, an underwater inspection robotics startup, are just two success stories to emerge from the program. Such developments have even increased venture funding confidence, with defense-focused funds like MountTech cropping up. Another industry that has benefited from heavy government involvement is spacetech. Since the 2013 Mars Orbiter Mission, the state has launched 13 high-profile missions, creating new demand from the ISRO for necessary technology. IN-SPACe, an autonomous, single-window, nodal agency for procurement, authorises purchasing, provides infrastructure support, and monitors and facilitates the marketplace for spacetech.  IN-SPACe also offers technical assistance to firms by sharing technologies, best practices, and products. The program has created a \u201cpredictable and enabling\u201d regulatory regime, bringing funding from $28 Mn in 2020 to $120 Mn in 2023.\u00a0 Industry 4.0 in India is similarly primed for growth. An expanding set of industrial Public Sector Undertakings are demonstrating growing openness to integrating  IoT  and  AI , offering a new customer base for industrially oriented DeepTech. Average contract values are still low compared to the Western players, but are rising steadily. The landscape, largely free of incumbents, will prove easier to navigate as these companies face new demand from a public sector looking to adapt for the modern age.\u00a0 At 8X, we have been looking to capitalise on this opportunity for some time. In 2020, 8X invested in Solinas Integrity, a robotics and computer vision startup earning government contracts to strengthen public sanitation infrastructure. Approximately 75% of Solinas\u2019s business is B2B2G and B2G sales. When it started, Solinas struggled to find backers for its product. It eventually partnered with municipalities and has since worked with channel partners across South India to provide its services.\u00a0 Today, our portfolio companies benefit heavily from government procurement. Pantherun, a cyber security innovator, got its first contracts to upgrade systems for BHEL and Indian Railways. They will also work with Bande Bharat this year. XYMA Analytics, an Industrial IoT sensor company that uses waveguide technology, frequently acts as a subcontractor for the government, with roughly 30% of its business B2G. In July, the Government released a policy draft to support the country\u2019s deeptech ecosystem. The policy will correct government fund disbursement\u2019s \u201cslow, fragmented, and siloed\u201d nature. Based on the IN-SPACe model, it will provide a single window throughout the lifecycle of government grants (from disbursal, tracking, and feedback) to streamline and improve transparency for startups.  It also unveils a common grant framework across government ministries that offer INR 200 Lakh for proof of concept and INR 300 Lakh for prototype. This program will continue to open possibilities for deeptech solutions with an array of public applications, from sanitation and water to agriculture.\u00a0 Deeptech startups are entering a new era of expanded spending, streamlined procurement processes, and robust infrastructure support throughout development. The sooner VCs recognise that opportunity, the sooner these startups can scale and ultimately solve this country\u2019s most pressing problems.\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Earlier this year, the US investor guru Warren Buffett made headlines by describing artificial intelligence as a genie that \u201cscares the hell out of me.\u201d The Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO has long been known for his extraordinary foresight, something of a genie himself because of his ability to predict lucrative investment opportunities. His words carry weight, and when he expresses concern, people listen. In this instance, while Buffett\u2019s caution is understandable, the potential of AI may be greater than the risks. Although disruptive technology is exciting, it can also raise concerns, particularly when even the AI scientists who developed it cannot fully explain the internal workings of its underlying mechanisms, such as transformers in GenAI. It is difficult to explain but the outcomes it delivers often feel nothing short of miraculous.\u00a0 I liken GenAI to the dot-com era of the late 1990s and early 2000s, a time when everyone wanted to tap into first-of-a-kind technology in the hopes of discovering new areas for innovation. Fast-forward two decades, and the power of the internet has been more fully realised. It has improved the way people live and how businesses run. I don\u2019t believe GenAI will take two decades to be realised fully \u2013 the world is changing as we speak. GenAI is just the beginning, marking a step toward  artificial general intelligence  (AGI), which can perform any intellectual task that can be accomplished by humans. Today\u2019s GenAI already enables AI tools to think logically and creatively like humans. This convergence of human-like reasoning with machines\u2019 vast computational power and data processing abilities is set to fundamentally transform business processes. For example, AI can analyse vast amounts of data at speeds far beyond human capability, identifying patterns and deriving insights that might otherwise go unnoticed. In contract management, this means AI can quickly review and analyse large volumes of commercial agreements to inform better decision-making and increase the pace of business.\u00a0 Contracts  form the backbone of global commerce, defining the rules of business for large and small companies everywhere. It is a single source of truth that a business has with its suppliers, partners, and customers, defining compliance, expected obligations, and the intent of the relationship. This makes contract data one of the most valuable untapped assets in the enterprise.\u00a0 GenAI\u2019s ability to think creatively and suggest actions within contracts has the potential to elevate commerce by optimising business relationships. This technology not only streamlines time-consuming and error-prone manual processes but also ensures the intent behind business relationships is fully realised. The benefits are twofold: enterprises can save money by reducing costs while also preventing revenue leakage, increasing revenue, reducing risk, and enhancing compliance. To effectively implement GenAI in contract management processes, businesses can follow these steps: When executed correctly, GenAI can substantially enhance business processes and deliver tangible value. It can reduce complexity and friction \u2013 the two deterrents to enterprise agility, allowing businesses to operate more efficiently and effectively. By transforming contract-driven processes, enterprises can optimise business outcomes around revenue, savings, and risk.\u00a0\u00a0 There has never been a more exciting time in business than now. In 20 years, we\u2019ll reflect and marvel at how little we knew about AI in its early days and how dramatically it has changed our lives for the better. However, to harness AI\u2019s full potential, we must approach it responsibly, starting with a clear understanding of its value within our organisations, its power and its limitations.\u00a0 By embracing GenAI, businesses can not only navigate the complexities of modern commerce in today\u2019s ever-changing economic environment but also set the stage for future success in an increasingly AI-driven world. Get this right, and Warren Buffett will realise he had nothing to fear.",

With the latest numbers from  Future Market Insights , the global on-shelf availability solution market is set to hit the desired figure of $4.8 Bn by 2024.\u00a0 Analyses show that this market will even continue to grow to a whopping $ 11.6 Bn by 2034, such that there is a healthy CAGR of 9.1% in the market during the research period of the forecast. These figures explain the growing need to manage OSA as ecommerce firms seek to deliver what consumers want, especially during holidays such as this festive season. On the one hand, the festive season is a unique chance to boost sales and make customers happy for ecommerce organisations. But with the growing demands comes the question of availability \u2013 having the right product at the right time and place. OSA is important during this period because a stockout situation will mean no sales, unsatisfied consumers, and loss of brand loyalty. For ecommerce businesses gearing up for the festive season, here is the ultimate guide to improving on-shelf availability. Accurate demand forecasting is the foundation of high OSA during the festive season. Ecommerce businesses must analyse historical sales data, market trends, and competitor behavior, while also considering potential events, holidays, and promotions that could drive demand.  Leveraging analytics and artificial intelligence can significantly enhance these forecasts , ensuring that inventory levels are aligned with expected demand.\u00a0 Inventory  planning should be conducted in tandem with demand forecasting, taking into account supply chain disruptions, supplier capabilities, and lead times. While it\u2019s advisable to stock up on frequently sold products, businesses should avoid overstocking to minimise holding costs and prevent markdowns postseason. The festive season is one of the important periods requiring suppliers to meet their commitments at high levels. It is necessary for ecommerce businesses to clearly convey the demand that they expect in the future to their suppliers so that the required capacities are available to meet such demands.\u00a0 Loyal supplier relationships mean that a company will be accorded special treatment, including priority on the stocks to be restocked and the time that it takes to have them restocked. Also, risks of supply chain disruption may be addressed by the expansion of the suppliers\u2019 list. This means that if one supplier is unable to supply essentials, having other sources available can help minimise the chances of running out of stock. Organisations need to employ  real-time inventory management  systems in order to maintain OSA during the festivities. These systems facilitate the monitoring of stock in different sales outlets and stores, giving a clear view of inventory. These systems can then be linked to ecommerce to automatically update stock status so that the customers do not get a wrong impression of what is available in the  warehouse .\u00a0 Furthermore, real-time inventory means that inventory management decisions have to be made in a short span of time. In cases where a particular product is selling much faster than expected, call for automatic reordering or transfer of stock in anticipation of the popular item. The idea of smooth functioning of fulfillment and logistics is key to sustaining OSA during the festive period. Fulfillment centers should be evaluated and possibly altered to make certain that the products are picked, packed, and shipped as quickly as possible. This might have entailed efficiencies in the processes of the warehouse, hiring of more workers, or outsourcing the extra load to a third-party company.\u00a0 Another important element that must be taken into consideration is last-mile delivery. Cutting costs and improving delivery reliability can be accomplished through choosing credible courier services and providing numerous delivery choices for customers, and they can also help minimise stockouts. One might also suggest adopting the distribution center strategy, which means warehousing is closer to certain key markets to reduce lead time and increase OSA. For OSA, particularly during the festive season, price and promotional strategies can play a great deal. It is recommended that ecommerce businesses should implement dynamic pricing models as a way of controlling the demand, especially where the retail price can be changed based on the existing sales data and available stock.\u00a0 For instance, if a given product is going around very fast in the market, some price increases can be made in order to regulate demand and scarcity. Promotions also must be accurately determined and controlled. Although using discounts and special offers promotes the products, it also contributes to exhaustion. Promotion decisions should be made with consideration to stock status, firms should offer either substitute options or pack slow-movers together with the best sellers in order to ensure equal sales of all stock. It demonstrated that customers should be informed clearly and in advance when OSA is in operation during the festive season. If a product is unavailable or lost, it is important to advise the clients to prevent cases of disappointment. That is why revealing similar goods\u2019 availability, giving options to pre-order, or offering back-in-stock notifications also contribute to maintaining customers who might switch to other suppliers.\u00a0 Moreover, businesses should employ customers\u2019 information to get in touch with the  customers in subsequent purchases  and remind them of potential products they have bought in the past or related to. This does not only improve the experience of shoppers but also creates demand for the available products in the market. After the festive season, conducting a thorough performance analysis based on OSA key indicators is crucial. Businesses should evaluate areas of success and identify opportunities for improvement. Key metrics to assess include the number of stockouts, replenishment times, and the accuracy of demand forecasts. Insights gained from this analysis should be used to refine processes, strengthen supplier relationships, and enhance inventory management for future high-demand periods. Maintaining availability during the holiday season is a difficult but essential process for many ecommerce companies. Through demand forecasting, building supplier relations, being able to manage inventory in real-time, choosing the best options for fulfilling orders, using dynamic pricing options, being able to communicate effectively with customers, and analysing data after the season, businesses can increase their sales while also providing a good shopping experience for the consumer. These strategies assist not only in getting through the holiday season but also in excelling during the period.",

        "Article Content": "The best way to predict your future is to create it. The journey of a startup is fraught with challenges, but mastering the skill of negotiation can turn the challenges into the opportunities. Almost all the current high valued startups had negotiated aggressively in the past, to protect their rights and interest.\u00a0 Imagine the conversation in the 1980s between Microsoft, a fledgling software company without a ready-made operating system, and IBM, a dominant player in the hardware industry wherein IBM struck a deal with Microsoft to provide an operating system to IBM for their new personal computers. The real genius lay in negotiation with IBM, wherein Microsoft instead of selling the operating system outright, retained the rights to license that operating system to other manufacturers. IBM failed to foresee the explosion of the personal computers market, agreed. The licensing rights not only allowed Microsoft to become a critical player in personal computing but also laid the foundation to become one of the most powerful companies of the world. Another example of negotiation genius could be WhatsApp\u2019s acquisition by Facebook. Apart from valuation and other commercial rights, founders of Whatsapp fought tooth and nail for the continuance of WhatsApp\u2019s strict privacy standard, end to end encryption of the messages and no ads. Facebook agreed to these terms and conditions, which was a significant deviation from its business model. India has the third largest startup ecosystem in the world, and it is riding high on creativity. In the coming years, we can overthrow all the incumbent champions of any field. When we delve into such a vastly paced ecosystem of early-stage startups, it is essential to understand that negotiation table is where dreams meet reality.\u00a0 On one hand founders come with a vision of innovation and ambition and on the other hand,  investors come with a pragmatic sense of business , but the true challenge lies in bridging the gap.\u00a0 In this high-stakes environment, where every term sheet detail can shape the future, mastering the art of negotiation is not about securing funds \u2013 it is also about building a relationship that can withstand the tumultuous journey of entrepreneurship. For both entrepreneurs and investors, understanding the intricacies of early-stage investment negotiations is paramount to success in this dynamic market. This guide provides a detailed overview of key issues and standard positions in venture capital financing rounds in India, offering valuable insights into the complexities of deal structuring, governance, and exit strategies. From the types of securities offered to the nuances of founder obligations and liquidation preferences, we\u2019ll explore the essential elements that shape early-stage investments in the Indian context. Whether you\u2019re a founder seeking funding or an investor looking to capitalise on India\u2019s startup boom, this comprehensive breakdown will equip you with the knowledge to navigate negotiations effectively and make informed decisions in the fast-paced world of Indian venture capital. In order for the founders to be incentivised to continue running the company, the following obligations with respect to their shares in the company are generally negotiated:\u00a0 The investors rely on contractual promises made by the founders to facilitate an exit either by creating liquidity through IPO or by sale to third parties or by buying out the investors stake: The culmination of a deal is a summation of various factors, where the both the parties try to protect their interests and at the same time cede some ground to accommodate the other party. The art of negotiation does not include strong arming the other party to get a favourable deal, it is an exercise to create a win-win situation for both the parties. Even seemingly impossible deadlocks and conflicts can be resolved if we shed the assumption that our only sources of leverage are money and muscle. As rightly said by Tom Wingfield \u201c Yes, I have tricks in my pocket. I have things up my sleeve. But I am the opposite of a stage magician. He gives you illusion that has the appearance of truth. I give you truth in the pleasant disguise of illusion .\u201d Effective negotiators know that  how  you articulate or structure your proposals can be as important as  what  you are proposing.",

        "Article Content": "After a challenging few years, the Indian startup ecosystem appears to be on the recovery path. Startup funding is showing signs of resurgence, and the startup IPO season is thriving, providing investors with optimism. Furthermore, an increasing number of second-time founders are embarking on new adventures, and CXOs are joining the Indian startup fray in droves. At a time when so much is happening in the world\u2019s third-largest startup space, it\u2019s time to shine the spotlight on some of the most innovative ventures that are making waves in the Indian startup ecosystem via Inc42\u2019s \u201830 Startups to Watch\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0 While finalising the startups for our 47th edition of the \u2018 30 Startups to Watch \u2019 series, we witnessed a healthy surge in the adoption of AI, along with the fact that close to 60% of these startups either raised less than $2 Mn or were completely bootstrapped.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This speaks volumes about the entrepreneurial spirit thriving within the Indian startup community, where limited resources are no longer viewed as an obstacle to innovation. While the aftermath of the funding winter still lurks somewhere in the shadows, making investors cautious, there are also hopes of a complete revival on the horizon. With that said, here are the 30 startups that caught our attention in May 2024. Editor\u2019s Note: The list below is not a ranking of any kind. We have listed the startups alphabetically. The increase in cloud adoption has also led to a surge in cyberattacks. While cloud security remains a complex domain to implement and manage, a McKinsey report anticipates that damages from such attacks could hit $10.5 Tn annually by 2025.

Observing this gap, the founder of  Fixerra , Akshar Shah, built a digital platform that allows people to invest in FDs offered by various banks. In simple words, Shah has created an FD marketplace where users can choose investment options from various banks, while the website shows how much each bank will be liable to return after a fixed tenure.

With India\u2019s shift to e-rickshaws and the $27.5 Bn e-rickshaw market projected growth, PointO strategically positions itself to capture significant market share. The issue of financing electric vehicles (EVs) in India, such as high upfront costs, limited financing options, and the lack of government incentives, particularly within the two and three-wheeler segment, remains deep-rooted. Despite the growing interest in electric mobility, accessing capital remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption. ProsParity , founded by Saurabh Khodke and Anirudh Dhakar, aims to offer innovative financing solutions for mass market and new-to-credit customers. It has developed an end-to-end electric mobility financing platform that emphasises compliance, scalability, and agility for lenders. By streamlining financing relationships for EV dealers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), ProsParity aims to facilitate easier access to financing for end-customers. Through its strategic B2B partnerships within the ecosystem, the company ensures scalable distribution while creating long-term underwriting advantages with \u2018asset risk models\u2019. By tailoring products to sync with customer profiles, ProsParity aims to play a crucial role in accelerating the transition towards electric mobility in India\u2019s mass-market segment. Recently, the EV financing platform secured $2 Mn (around 16.6 Cr) in its pre-seed funding from BEENEXT, Sparrow Capital, All In Capital, DeVC, and Huddle Ventures. Parin and Prit Sanghvi, the brother duo, founded  Reelo  in 2021 after identifying that small businesses often lack efforts on the marketing front. However, the ones that do not, end up with poor results. Today, Reelo brings enterprise-level customer data, loyalty and marketing automation technology to underserved small and mid-sized restaurant and retail businesses. It helps restaurants and retail businesses maximise their revenue and growth through its loyalty marketing and data analytics platform.

Operating primarily in India, Scimplify also engages in cross-border trade with countries, including New Zealand, the UAE, Egypt, Vietnam, Jordan, and Taiwan. The company aims to expand its manufacturing capabilities in India this year. In the long term, Scimplify plans to become a leading global marketplace for speciality chemicals, connecting suppliers and consumers worldwide. Since 2011, India has witnessed an unprecedented rise in digital commerce shipping. To cater to the heightened demand, businesses tap into a plethora of logistics options to fuel their supply chain. With this, managing multiple logistics players in their supply chain gets cumbersome. To simplify this process, Pawan Kumar, Ajay K, and Lalit Singh founded  ShipEase , which consolidates all courier partners, virtual shops and communication tools like Whatsapp and IVR on a single screen to support SMEs in their ecommerce journey. The startup also caters to different business needs, offering an order management system, a courier management system, or a combination of both with aggregation. The startup generates revenue through a subscription fee. Additionally, it charges a transaction fee for each order processed and offers premium services for advanced features and integrations, ensuring a steady income stream. It claims to have seen 1 Mn orders in March this year and plans to achieve a monthly recurring revenue of INR 10 Cr soon. The Indian edtech sector, transformed by the Covid-19 pandemic, is on the verge of another major shift with the rise of GenAI. This technology promises to reshape education even more deeply. SuperKalam , founded in July 2023 by Vimal Singh Rathore and Aseem Gupta, is an AI-driven mentoring platform for competitive exams like UPSC. Unlike traditional edtech platforms, SuperKalam offers a personalised learning experience, putting students at the centre.

SuperKalam is Vimal\u2019s second venture, following the success of Coursavy, which was acquired by Unacademy in 2020. A few days ago, the UPSC test prep platform raised $2 Mn (INR 16.6 Cr) in a seed funding round led by YCombinator and Fundersclub. Founded by former Swiggy executive Kailash Nichani in 2024,  Topee  offers painless, guaranteed solutions for baldness in both men and women through its cosmetic hair restoration products.

Wizr AI aims to onboard its first 10 customers, achieve PMF, and generate $1 Mn in revenue by 2024. By 2026, the startup targets an ARR of $3-5 Mn with 50 customers. The Indian financial paradigm has long struggled with a lack of personalisation, offering one-size-fits-all solutions that fail to address individual financial needs and goals. Despite the growing number of investment tech platforms, there is a dearth of players who provide tailored advice or services to serve the unique needs of individual customers. Zactor Tech \u2018s inception began when Abhishek Walia, a chartered accountant, identified this gap in the Indian fintech space at IIM-Calcutta. This led to the incorporation of Zactor Tech in 2023, which is today focussed on \u201csimplifying finance and empowering every Indian to achieve their financial goals with ease and confidence\u201d. It is a platform for working individuals to make their financial journey easy with the help of its personalised recommendations and insights. So far, it has integrated mutual funds on its platform. The integration of FDs, bonds and P2P investments are in the pipeline. Zactor Tech wants to redefine personal finance management with an approach that includes goal-based investing, detailed financial roadmaps, and insurance optimisation insights. The platform offers personalised investment recommendations tailored to its users\u2019 goals, time horizons, and risk profiles. Additional features include comprehensive retirement planning, monthly PDF financial reports, automated financial data retrieval and a financial literacy app for learning. Currently, the startup is working on the distribution model and not charging any upfront fees from the users. It aims to onboard 25,000 users by the end of this year. Founded by Naveen Venkatesan, Bharathi Kannan Ravikumar, Sunil Kumar, and Sreelesh Pillai in 2023,  ZEPIC  is a customer experience platform that unites all customer-facing teams.

        "Article Content": "Indian new-age tech stocks rallied significantly this week as the broader market continued the upward momentum, helped by positive domestic and global cues. Twenty one out of the 24 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage gained during the week in a range of 0.4% to over 11% on the BSE.\u00a0 D2C beauty brand Mamaearth emerged as the biggest winner this week, with its shares surging 11.1%. It was followed by Tracxn Technologies, which jumped 9.8%. Shares of recently-listed ixigo also zoomed 8.7% on the back of its strong FY24 earnings. Shares of Paytm, TAC Infosec, and CarTrade also surged over 8%. MapmyIndia, Awfis, RateGain, ideaForge, and Nazara Technologies were among the other gainers. However, shares of Delhivery fell about 1.1% this week after the announcement of it expanding its ESOP pool. Meanwhile, PB Fintech and TBO Tek declined 1.1% and 3.2% on the BSE, respectively, after being the top two gainers last week.\u00a0 In the broader market, benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty50 gained 1.22% and 1.3%, respectively. However, Sensex ended marginally lower at 79,996.6 on Friday while Nifty50 closed marginally higher at 24,323.85. Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, said that the domestic market maintained its upward momentum on the advancement of monsoon and anticipation of the upcoming Union Budget.\u00a0 Besides, a reduction in US personal consumption expenditure inflation has also raised hopes for a Fed rate cut in September, he said. \u201cAs the market enters the earnings season, starting with IT bellwether TCS, expectations are for better results. Investors will closely watch management commentary for insights into the sector\u2019s outlook. Overall, Q1 expectations remain subdued. However, recent high-frequency economic indicators, the RBI\u2019s upgrade for FY25 GDP target to 7.2% from 7%, with a Q1 forecast of 7.3%, and easing global inflation reduce the likelihood of weak corporate results,\u201d Nair added.\u00a0 It is pertinent to note that the Budget session of the Parliament will commence on July 22, with the first Union Budget of the Narendra Modi government\u2019s third term to be presented on July 23. Meanwhile, Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal, sees the market consolidating at a higher zone after gaining nearly 7% in the last month. In the coming week, more stock and sector-specific actions are expected as the market starts taking cues from Q1 FY25 earnings, he added. Overall, the 24 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage ended the week with a total market capitalisation of $59.85 Bn versus $58.42 Bn last week. After its stellar debut on the Indian bourses last month, ixigo posted its March quarter and  FY24 earnings results  on Thursday (July 4). While its net profit more than tripled year-on-year (YoY) to INR 73.1 Cr during the year, operating revenue increased almost 31% to INR 655.9 Cr. Shares of ixigo rose 4.8% on Thursday ahead of the result announcement. The shares jumped over 7% during the intraday trading on the BSE on Friday but ended the week\u2019s last trading session about 4% higher at INR 170.45. Speaking on the stock\u2019s performance, Prashanth Tapse, senior VP, research analyst at Mehta Equities, said that following the rise in the share price post its listing, the valuations seem overstretched currently.\u00a0 \u201cGiven ixigo\u2019s strong presence in rail bookings and a significant market share through ixigo and ConfirmTkt, the company is well-positioned in the rapidly growing travel sector. Hence, only risk-taking investors can continue to hold on to risk for a long-term perspective, while conservative investors should wait and watch for any dips to enter,\u201d he added. ixigo\u2019s current market cap stands at INR 6,603.63 Cr as against INR 6,275.87 Cr on the listing day.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Riyank Arora, technical analyst at Mehta Equities, said that the stock is trading below its immediate resistance level of INR 177.5 and above the major support level of INR 150. A move above INR 177.5 is likely to generate momentum, pushing the rally towards INR 197.5 and then INR 225.\u00a0 \u201cTraders and investors should consider buying on dips around INR 165-INR 167 with a firm stop loss at INR 150,\u201d Arora added. Shares of Paytm jumped 8.5% this week to end the last trading session at INR 436.6 on the BSE.\u00a0 Amid significant volatility, Paytm has largely been trading sideways. However, it managed to close above the INR 430 level this week, the highest since the beginning of February this year, when the stock traded above the INR 440 level. However, the shares are still trading 43% lower than the INR 760 level last seen at the end of January this year, just before the RBI\u2019s clampdown on Paytm Payments Bank. This week, the shares gained some momentum on the back of a few developments in the company. Earlier this week, Paytm rolled out a new health and protection plan,  \u2018Paytm Health Saathi\u2019 , for its merchant partners to facilitate them with affordable and comprehensive healthcare benefits. Meanwhile, a report said that  Paytm Payments Bank Ltd is at odds with its auditor JC Bhalla & Co.  over the certification of its FY24 accounts. Over the last one month, Paytm shares have gained over 28% on the BSE. Shares of Zomato saw a strong uptrend earlier this week but lost some gains in the latter half. Overall, the stock gained 3.6% to end the last trading session at INR 207.5 on the BSE. The shares touched a new record high at INR 213.8 on Wednesday (July 3). This also came amid multiple business developments in the company. Though the company received a new goods and service tax  (GST) demand notice of INR 9.45 Cr  from the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (Audit) in Karnataka, the news development failed to show any major impact on the stock this week. Meanwhile, reiterating its \u2018buy\u2019 rating on the stock and a fair value of INR 225, Kotak Institutional Equities, said in a new research report that it expects Zomato to report healthy Q1 FY25 results, driven by 23% YoY growth in food delivery GMV and 113% YoY growth in Blinkit GMV.\u00a0 \u201cWe expect both businesses to report sequential CM (contribution margin) improvement, driven by better take rate (higher platform fee in food delivery) and advertising income (in Blinkit),\u201d the brokerage added.",

        "Article Content": "Indian new-age tech stocks experienced a mixed week as investors await the upcoming Union Budget and earnings for the first quarter of the ongoing fiscal year 2024-25 (Q1 FY25).\u00a0 Analysts expect stock-specific actions in the coming week amid the ongoing earnings season.\u00a0 Ten out of the 24 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage gained this week in a range of 1% to a little over 12%. Recently-listed coworking startup Awfis emerged as the biggest gainer, with its shares zooming over 12%.\u00a0 Earlier in the week, shares of Awfis touched a record high of INR 635 during intraday trading on July 11. TAC Infosec trailed Awfis, with its shares rising 8.78% this week.\u00a0\u00a0 Paytm and Zomato also saw a healthy uptrend this week, with shares of both the companies gaining over 7% each. Paytm is scheduled to declare its financial results for Q1 FY25 on July 19. Nykaa, PB Fintech, and ixigo were among the other gainers this week. On the other hand, 14 startups, including last week\u2019s top gainer Honasa, MapmyIndia, Go Digit, and TBO Tek, were among the losers this week. Their shares fell in the range of 0.02% to over 8%. Blockchain and IT development startup Yudiz emerged as the biggest loser this week.\u00a0 Amid all these, the ongoing IPO boom continued. On July 7, logistics unicorn  BlackBuck filed its IPO papers  with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The startup is looking to raise INR 550 Cr via fresh issue of shares. Besides, the  IPO of D2C men\u2019s grooming brand Menhood  is scheduled to open on July 16. The startup\u2019s IPO will comprise a fresh issue of 25,95,200 equity shares of face value of INR 10 each. It is expected to raise INR 19.5 Cr via its IPO. Meanwhile, the broader market maintained its bullish momentum this week. Sensex gained 0.6% to end the week at 80,519.34, while Nifty50 rose 0.7% this week to end Friday\u2019s session at 24,502.15. Commenting on the market\u2019s performance this week, Geojit Financial Services\u2019 head of research Vinod Nair said that while investors are cautious about the earnings session, there are also expectations of the government presenting a growth-oriented Budget. Meanwhile, Emkay Wealth Management\u2019s head of research Dr Joseph Thomas said, \u201cMarkets trended higher towards the close of the week as the earnings season kicked off on a positive note and inflation numbers in the US were better than expected. The current phase of volatility cannot be ruled out as profit booking may continue ahead of the Budget, which will provide more clarity on policy continuity.\u201d\u00a0 Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget 2024-25 on July 23.\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the performance of some of the new-age tech stocks this week.\u00a0 Overall, the total market capitalisation of the 24 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage stood at $63.02 Bn at the end of this week.\u00a0 Shares of Paytm ended the week, which was filled with multiple developments for the company, 7.2% higher at INR 467.25.\u00a0 While shares of Paytm have been under pressure since February this year, following the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI) curbs on Paytm Payments Bank Ltd (PPBL), the stock has been seeing an uptrend since last month. The company was also in the news for multiple reasons this week. Let\u2019s take a look: All eyes will now be on Paytm\u2019s Q1 numbers, scheduled to be declared on Friday (July 19).\u00a0 In its last disclosed  financial results for Q4 FY24 , Paytm\u2019s loss more than tripled to INR 550.5 Cr from INR 167.5 Cr in the year-ago period. Revenue from operations also declined 2.9% to INR 2,267.10 Cr during the quarter from INR 2,334 Cr in Q4 FY23.\u00a0 However, CEO and founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma recently reiterated his optimism about the company\u2019s future and said his vision is to turn Paytm into a $100 Bn company.\u00a0 Continuing its bull run, the foodtech major\u2019s shares touched a fresh all-time high of INR 223.40 during the intraday trading on July 12. The stock has jumped nearly 170% in the last one year. Recently, Zomato received its shareholders\u2019 approval to create a new employee stock option pool of 18.26 Cr shares. However, earlier this week, JM Financial  cut Zomato\u2019s price target to INR 230  from INR 250 previously. Giving its reasoning, the brokerage said that ESOP grants should be linked to measurable performance-based outcomes, which is not the case with Zomato\u2019s newly laid-out policy. \u201cThere is a risk of the new ESOP policy being considered unfair by some shareholders as they would be the ones taking a meaningful hit on their earnings in the medium term\u201d, said JM Financial analysts. While investor interest has been bullish on the coworking space provider startup since its listing on the bourses in May, the company\u2019s shares touched an all-time high of INR 635 during the intraday trading on July 11. The stock has gained 43% on the BSE since its listing on May 30.\u00a0 Recently, Awfis managing director and chairman Amit Ramani told Inc42 that the startup\u2019s  top line is expected to breach the INR 1,100 Cr mark in FY25 . The company is also looking to expand its portfolio by about 50%, reaching a total of 1,35,000 operational seats by the end of the year.\u00a0 Awfis turned profitable in Q4 FY24, posting a profit after tax (PAT) of INR 1.4 Cr on an operating revenue of INR 232.3 Cr.",

        "Article Content": "Most of the Indian new-age tech stocks declined this week amid the ongoing earnings season and a global IT outage, despite the broader market seeing a slight uptick. Twenty one out of the 24 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage fell this week in a range of 0.28% to just under 12%. Cybersecurity startup TAC infosec emerged as the biggest loser, with its shares dropping 11.99% to end the week at INR 527.95.\u00a0 Nazara, Paytm, Zomato, and Nykaa were among the losers this week. Meanwhile, only three stocks \u2013 Awfis, Yudiz and Go Digit \u2013 gained this week. Continuing its bull run from last week, coworking startup Awfis emerged as the biggest gainer (up 452%) this week.\u00a0 It is pertinent to note that markets remained closed on Wednesday (July 17). Meanwhile the broader market maintained its upward momentum this week. However, Nifty 50 and Sensex fell nearly 1% each after a global IT outage created by a cybersecurity-related  mishap at big tech Microsoft . Overall, Sensex and Nifty 50 gained 0.1% this week to end at 80,604.65 and 24,530.90, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0 The IT outage barred users from accessing various Microsoft 365 apps and services, impacting businesses across industries globally. In India, airtravel, brokerages and some financial institutions were impacted.\u00a0 Commenting on the market performance this week, Mehta Equities\u2019 senior VP (research) Prashanth Tapse said investors began profit booking on Friday amid the news of disruptions across industries.\u00a0 \u201cIT stocks, which held ground in early trades, too gave up their gains, while other sectoral and broader indices incurred substantial losses after sentiment turned extremely bearish on weak global cues and reports of online businesses in several countries, including in India, hit by cyber outages,\u201d Tapse said.\u00a0 Analysts expect stock-specific actions in the coming weeks as the earning season picks up pace.\u00a0 Reliance Industries, Paytm, and Justdial were among the companies which reported their Q1 FY25 numbers this week. Shares of Justdial surged nearly 24% this week after the company posted a  69% year-on-year increase in net profit to INR 141.22 Cr  in the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Next week, all eyes will be on finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman as she presents the Union Budget on July 23. Motilal Oswal Financial Services\u2019 retail research head Siddhartha Khemka said that the Budget announcements will set the direction for the market for the coming weeks.\u00a0 \u201cInvestors are anticipating pro-industry and populist measures with prudence on fiscal matters. If the Budget meets the expectations, it will provide more stability in the market,\u201d he added.\u00a0 Overall, the total market capitalisation of the 24 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage stood at $60.99 Bn at the end of this week as against $63.02 Bn last week.\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the performance of some of the new-age tech stocks. Hit by the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI\u2019s) regulatory action, fintech major Paytm reported another quarter of weak earnings. Its  net loss stood at INR 840.1 Cr  in the June quarter, a 134% jump from INR 358.4 Cr in the year-ago period. Operating revenue also declined 36% to INR 1,502 Cr.\u00a0\u00a0 However, the Vijay Shekhar Sharma-led startup said it anticipates  enhanced revenue and profitability in the future . The company cited the revival of its merchant payment business, expansion of its loan cross-selling vertical, and robust product-market fit in its shop insurance vertical as key drivers for this growth. These projections were well received by the bourses as the company\u2019s shares  surged 6%  to INR 472.15 during the intraday trading session on the BSE on Friday. Despite this, the stock ended the week 1.83% lower, breaking the upward momentum of two weeks. Paytm also informed that it received a show cause notice from market regulator SEBI in relation to a grant of  2.1 Cr employee stock options (ESOP)  to CEO Sharma. The company also received an  administrative warning letter  from SEBI over related party transactions conducted by the company with Paytm Payments Bank in FY22.\u00a0 Continuing last week\u2019s bull run, foodtech major Zomato\u2019s shares surged as high as INR 232 during the intraday trading on Monday. However, the stock lost steam later to end the week 1.64% lower at INR 218.80 on the BSE.\u00a0 Zomato was in the news for multiple new developments this week: All eyes will now be on Zomato\u2019s Q1 FY25 numbers. The company is yet to declare the date for the results announcement.\u00a0 Kotak Institutional Equities anticipates that Zomato will reveal robust results for Q1 FY25, driven by a 23% YoY growth in food delivery gross merchandise value (GMV) and an impressive 113% YoY growth in Blinkit\u2019s GMV. Nuvama projects Zomato\u2019s revenue to increase 11.5% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) and an impressive 64.4% YoY. Adjusted revenue from the food delivery segment is anticipated to grow 5.3% QoQ and 23.9% YoY, while Blinkit is forecasted to grow 29% QoQ. JM Financial, also said in a recent research note, that it expects Zomato to report a very strong quarter sequentially for its food delivery and quick commerce businesses in Q1 FY25. Despite the broader bearish trend in new-age tech stocks, Awfis continued its winning run this week. The stock hit the 20% upper circuit on Thursday during the intraday trading on the BSE, reaching  a new 52-week high of INR 757.20 . While the stock plunged 7.63% on Friday, Awfis ended the week 4.52% higher at INR 647.20.\u00a0 The startup\u2019s shares have gained about 50% since its  listing in May . Recently, Awfis managing director and chairman Amit Ramani told Inc42 that the startup is expected to  surpass the INR 1,100 Cr revenue mark in FY25 . Additionally, it aims to expand its operational seats by approximately 50%, reaching a total of 1,35,000 seats by the end of the year.\u00a0 Awfis  achieved profitability in Q4 FY24 , reporting a profit after tax (PAT) of INR 1.4 Cr on an operating revenue of INR 232.3 Cr.",

        "Article Content": "After a big funding week, investment activity across the Indian startup ecosystem has entered into the slow lane again. Between June 24 and 29, startups cumulatively bagged $196.47 Mn across 17 deals, a 75% decline from $800.5 Mn raised across 21 deals in the preceding week. However, it would be unfair to say that funding trends plunged drastically this week. Of the $800.5 Mn secured last week, around  $665 Mn was raised  by quick commerce unicorn Zepto alone. Hence, the rest of the startup ecosystem only saw $135.5 Mn capital infusion in the week.\u00a0 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Date \n Name \n Sector \n Subsector \n Business Model \n Funding Round Size \n Funding Round Type \n Investors \n Lead Investor \n \n \n 25 Jun 2024 \n Northern Arc \n Fintech \n Lendingtech \n B2B \n $75 Mn \n Debt \n FMO \n FMO \n \n \n 25 Jun 2024 \n Rocketlane \n Enterprisetech \n Horizontal SaaS \n B2B \n $24 Mn \n Series B \n 8VC, Matrix Partners India, Nexus Venture Partners \n 8VC, Matrix Partners India, Nexus Venture Partners \n \n \n 27 Jun 2024 \n Smartworks \n Real Estate Tech \n Shared Spaces \n B2B \n $20.2 Mn \n \u2013 \n Keppel Ltd, Ananta Capital Ventures Fund I, Plutus Capital LLC \n \u2013 \n \n \n 25 Jun 2024 \n Zyod \n Ecommerce \n B2B Ecommerce \n B2B \n $18 Mn \n Series A \n RTP Global, Stride Ventures, Stride One, Trifecta Capital, Lightspeed, Alteria Capital \n RTP Global \n \n \n 24 Jun 2024 \n Bluestone \n Ecommerce \n D2C \n B2C \n $12 Mn \n Debt \n Neo Markets \n Neo Markets \n \n \n 25 Jun 2024 \n Cloudphysician \n Healthtech \n Healthcare SaaS \n B2B \n $10.5 Mn \n Series A \n Peak XV Partners, Elevar Equity, Panthera Peak \n Peak XV Partners \n \n \n 28 Jun 2024 \n Matter \n Clean Tech \n Electric Vehicles \n B2C \n $10 Mn \n \u2013 \n Japan Airlines & Translink Fund, Capital 2B Fund, Helena Special Investments Fund, Abhay Shah \n \u2013 \n \n \n 25 Jun 2024 \n Sid\u2019s Farm \n Ecommerce \n D2C \n B2C \n $10 Mn \n Series A \n Omnivore, Narotam Sekhsaria\u2019s family office \n Omnivore, Narotam Sekhsaria\u2019s family office \n \n \n 26 Jun 2024 \n Two Brothers \n Ecommerce \n D2C \n B2C \n $7 Mn \n Series A \n Rainmatter Capital, Raju Chekuri \n Rainmatter Capital \n \n \n 27 Jun 2024 \n Morphing Machines \n Deeptech \n IoT & Hardware \n B2B \n $2.7 Mn \n Seed \n Speciale Invest, IvyCap Ventures, Golden Sparrow, Navam Capital, CIIE Initiatives, DeVC \n Speciale Invest \n \n \n 25 Jun 2024 \n Nitro Commerce \n Enterprisetech \n Vertical SaaS \n B2B \n $1.8 Mn \n Seed \n Cornerstone Venture Partners, Warmup Ventures, Lead Angels, Dholakia Ventures, India Accelerator, Arjun Vaidya, Kunal Khattar \n Cornerstone Venture Partners \n \n \n 25 Jun 2024 \n LetsDressUp \n Ecommerce \n D2C \n B2C \n $1.3 Mn \n pre-Series A \n GVFL Limited, Indian Angel Network, The Chennai Angels, Titan Capital \n \u2013 \n \n \n 25 Jun 2024 \n LXME \n Fintech \n Investment Tech \n B2C \n $1.2 Mn \n Seed \n Kalaari Capital, Yash Kela, Amaya Ventures, Capri Holdings, Aditi Kothari, Vivek Vig, Sumit Jalan, Avinash Pahuja \n Kalaari Capital \n \n \n 25 Jun 2024 \n Plus Gold \n Fintech \n Investment Tech \n B2C \n $1.2 Mn \n Seed \n JITO Incubation, Innovation Foundation, Venture Catalysts, Signal Ventures, Sonakshi Sinha, Sachin Shetty, Varun Dua \n JITO Incubation, Innovation Foundation \n \n \n 26 Jun 2024 \n O Hi \n Media & Entertainment \n Social Media & Chat \n B2C \n $1 Mn \n pre-Series A \n JIIF \n JIIF \n \n \n 27 Jun 2024 \n Machaxi \n Consumer Services \n Hyperlocal Services \n B2C \n $575K \n pre-Series A \n Inflection Point Ventures, Ankit Nagori \n Inflection Point Ventures \n \n \n 27 Jun 2024 \n Celebal Technologies \n Enterprisetech \n Horizontal SaaS \n B2B \n \u2013 \n \u2013 \n BlackSoil \n BlackSoil \n \n \n \n Source: Inc42 \n*Part of a larger round \nNote: Only disclosed funding rounds have been included \n \n \n \n \n",

        "Article Content": "Cloud kitchen unicorn  Rebel Foods  narrowed its net loss by 42% to INR 378.2 Cr in the fiscal year 2023-24 (FY24) from  INR 656.5 Cr in the previous fiscal year . The Faasos-parent trimmed its loss on the back of an increase in its top line and controlled expenses. Rebel Foods\u2019 operating revenue jumped 19% to INR 1,420.2 Cr in FY24 from INR 1,195.2 Cr in FY23. Founded in 2011 by Kallol Banerjee and Jaydeep Barman, Rebel Foods owns and operates multiple quick service restaurant (QSR) brands like Behrouz Biryani, Ovenstory Pizza, The Good Bowl, SLAY Coffee, among others.\u00a0 The startup primarily earns revenue from the sale of food items through its own cloud kitchens as well as those owned by third parties. It also earns via delivery charges and royalties through partnerships with other partners. Rebel Foods\u2019 revenue from the sale of food items stood at INR 1,373.7 Cr in FY24 while its revenue from services, which included commission and storage income and franchise income, stood at INR 31 Cr. The startup operates over 450 kitchens spanning 80 cities in India. It is also present in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, and the UK. In May, the  cloud kitchen startup secured INR 110 Cr in debt  from Alteria Capital and InnoVen Capital. While Alteria pumped in INR 65 Cr, InnoVen invested INR 45 Cr in the debt round. In FY24, Rebel Foods saw a mere 1.6% increase in its total expenses to INR 1,857 Cr from INR 1,827 Cr in the previous fiscal year.\u00a0 Here is a breakdown of some of the key expenditures incurred by the company during the fiscal:\u00a0 Cost Of Materials Consumed : Even though this was the biggest cost for the company, the expenses under this head rose only 5.8% to INR 613.3 Cr in FY24 from INR 577.5 Cr in FY23.\u00a0 Employee Benefit Expenses:  Employee-related costs declined 2.6% to INR 394.9 Cr during the year under review from INR 405.5 Cr in FY23.\u00a0 Brokerages & Commissions : The startup spent INR 229.9 Cr on brokerages and commissions in the year ended March 2024 as against INR 163.3 Cr in the previous fiscal. However, it did not give any further details about these expenses.\u00a0 Advertising & Promotional Expenses : The foodtech unicorn spent nearly INR 133.7 Cr towards advertising, publicity and sales promotions in FY24, down 32% from INR 197.9 Cr in FY23.\u00a0 Legal Professional Costs:  Expenses incurred under this bucket fell nearly 20% YoY to INR 19.3 Cr during the year under review from INR 24 Cr in FY23.\u00a0 Backed by the likes of Peak XV Partners, Coatue and Lightbox, Rebel Foods has raised more than $549 Mn in funding to date.

This stage is not only crucial for customer satisfaction but also represents a significant portion of delivery costs and challenges for logistics providers. The last mile of delivery has always been fraught with complexities, from managing traffic congestion to ensuring timely deliveries in densely populated urban areas. The stakes are high: inefficiencies in this stage can lead to increased costs, customer dissatisfaction, and competitive disadvantage. With the rise of ecommerce, the demand for faster, more reliable deliveries has never been greater. Innovations in  artificial intelligence  (AI) are stepping in to transform last-mile logistics, making it more efficient, predictable, and responsive to consumer needs. Tracking a package is now an expected feature for consumers. The lack of real-time tracking can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction. However, with the implementation of IoT devices and GPS tracking systems, businesses can provide real-time updates to their customers. This transparency not only improves customer satisfaction but also enhances the overall efficiency of the delivery process. For MSMEs, real-time tracking and visibility are essential. By leveraging these technologies, businesses can respond quickly to any disruptions or delays, ensuring that customers are always informed about their delivery status.\u00a0 Timely communication with customers is crucial in the logistics industry. AI-driven communication platforms enable businesses to provide real-time updates, reducing the likelihood of missed or delayed deliveries. By managing customer expectations effectively, businesses can enhance satisfaction and foster loyalty. For MSMEs, ensuring timely communication with customers is crucial. Implementing AI-driven communication platforms helps businesses stay connected with their customers, providing updates on delivery status and resolving issues promptly. This not only improves customer satisfaction but also builds trust and reliability, essential factors for business growth in a competitive market. Many difference makers in the third-party logistics industry have created proprietary software to enhance communication efficiency. For example, it can be a WhatsApp integration tool that can streamline the buyer-seller process by enabling 24/7 order confirmations and updates. Undelivered shipments can be a major headache for logistics providers, leading to customer dissatisfaction and increased operational costs. Implementing a structured process to handle  non-delivery reports  (NDR) can significantly mitigate these issues. AI-driven systems can analyse delivery patterns, identify common failure points, and suggest improvements to enhance delivery success rates. For MSMEs, addressing non-delivery issues is vital. By using AI to manage and resolve delivery failures, businesses can ensure that packages reach their intended recipients promptly. This structured approach not only reduces the incidence of undelivered shipments but also helps maintain customer trust and satisfaction. Effective NDR systems are essential for improving delivery reliability and reducing operational disruptions. Warehousing is another area where AI is making significant strides. By automating sorting and packing processes, businesses can speed up operations, reduce errors, and cut labor costs. Predictive analytics helps businesses anticipate demand, ensuring that products are available when and where they are needed. For MSMEs, the integration of AI and automation in warehousing is transformative. Predictive analytics helps businesses anticipate demand, ensuring that products are available when and where they are needed. This not enhances operational efficiency but also reduces costs, allowing MSMEs to offer competitive pricing and faster deliveries. The adoption of AI in logistics operations positions businesses to meet the growing demands of the ecommerce market effectively. The significance of last mile logistics has soared in recent years due to the exponential growth of ecommerce, changing consumer expectations, and the need for efficient, timely deliveries. Today\u2019s consumers demand shorter delivery times, live tracking, and seamless experiences, forcing providers to continuously innovate and optimise their last-mile operations.The integration of AI in last mile logistics offers transformative capabilities, from optimising delivery routes and enhancing customer communication to predicting demand patterns and automating warehouse operations. By leveraging these innovative technologies, businesses can overcome the complexities of last mile delivery, enhance efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction. As we look to the future, the role of AI in logistics will only continue to grow. The advancements in AI, analytics, and infrastructure will lead to more widespread adoption and greater effectiveness, positioning businesses to gain a competitive edge in the evolving market landscape. By embracing AI-driven solutions, businesses can ensure faster, more reliable, and cost-effective deliveries, ultimately transforming the last-mile logistics experience for both businesses and consumers.",

        "Article Content": "The month of September started relatively in a high spirit as far as the startup funding is concerned. In the first week of the ongoing month, i.e., between September 2 and 7, Indian startups collectively managed to secure $348 Mn in funding across 19 deals,  25% lower than $466 Mn  raised by 16 startups in the closing week of August.\u00a0 The week further saw two mega deals with Drip Capital bagging $133 Mn, and Rapido finally announcing its massive $200 Mn funding from WestBridge

        "Article Content": "In a week in which finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the first Union Budget of Modi government 3.0, new-age tech stocks rallied in line with the broader market and stock-specific developments. Twenty one out of the 24 stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage ended the week with gains in the range of 0.26% to almost 11%. Shares of Paytm breached the INR 500 mark after a long time and the stock emerged as the biggest gainer this week with a 10.93% jump. Nykaa, Zomato and Mamaearth also rose this week. Traveltech startups EaseMyTrip, Yatra, and ixigo gained this week after the finance minister announced a  slew of initiatives  in her budget speech to boost tourism. The government announced support plans for comprehensive development of Vishnupad Temple Corridor and Mahabodhi Temple Corridor to boost the spiritual tourism sector.  The finance minister allocated INR 2,479.62 Cr for the tourism sector for FY25, up 46% from the revised allocation of INR 1,692.10 Cr in FY24.\u00a0 Shares of geotech company MapMyIndia also soared over 5% this week as Sitharaman announced plans to  digitise land records  in urban India with GIS mapping. Only three new-age tech stocks ended in the red this week \u2013 Awfis, TAC Infosec, and Yudiz, declining in a range of 0.8% to about 3%. Meanwhile, the broader market continued its upward momentum this week. Sensex gained 0.9% to end at 81,332.72, while Nifty 50 rose 1.2% this week to end at 24,834.85.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Commenting on the market performance this week, Geojit Financial Services\u2019 head of research Vinod Nair said that the budget was both populist and prudent, and failed to spark any significant excitement in the market. \u201cThe market has now recovered its losses from budget day, driven by positive US GDP data and expectations of improved global demand. Moving forward, the direction of the domestic market will likely be influenced by the progress of the earnings season,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Prashanth Tapse, senior VP of research at Mehta Equities, said that Indian markets outperformed the global peers this week on the back of a strong buying support across the board. He attributed this resilience to the strong growth of the Indian economy and better-than-expected earnings reports of blue chip and mid-cap companies. Amid the  startup IPO rush , Jaipur-based D2C men\u2019s grooming brand Menhood made iCts public market debut on the NSE Emerge this week and became the latest stock under Inc42\u2019s coverage. Overall, the total market capitalisation of the 25 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage stood at $63.27 Bn at the end of this week. The valuation of 24 new-age stocks stood at $60.99 Bn last week.\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the performance of some of the listed new-age tech stocks this week.\u00a0 Shares of Paytm surged nearly 11% this week to cross the INR 500 mark after the company received the long-pending approval from the government to invest INR 50 Cr in its payments arm, Paytm Payment Services. The stock surged 10% on Friday (July 26) after it was reported that the Vijay Shekhar Sharma-led company has secured the investment approval, which would allow it  to  apply for an online payment aggregator (PA) licence . It is pertinent to note that Paytm reported an underwhelming financial performance in the first quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25 (Q1 FY25), with its net loss widening 134% year-on-year to INR 840.1 Cr. Paytm was in the news this week for a number of other reasons:\u00a0 Commenting on the stock\u2019s performance, Amol Athawale, VP of technical research at Kotak Securities, said, \u201cWe maintain a neutral stance on Paytm, viewing the recent movement as a potential pullback or technical rebound. We anticipate short-term bullish trends to persist. It is difficult to predict in the long term as there\u2019s been too much volatility in the stock.\u201d\u00a0 Insurtech unicorn Go Digit this week reported a  74% increase in its profit after tax (PAT)  to INR 101 Cr in Q1 FY25 from INR 58 Cr in the year-ago quarter. Its net earned premium also rose to INR 1,824 Cr during the period under review from INR 1,475 Cr in the year-ago quarter.\u00a0 Following the disclosure of Q1 numbers on June 25, the  stock rallied over 8%  to touch INR 362.25 apiece during the intraday trading session on the BSE on June 26. Overall, Go Digit rose 0.26% this week to end at INR 345.45.\u00a0 Athawale said that Go Digit\u2019s immediate resistance level is INR 370 and support for the stock is seen at INR 335. He added that the stock would see a strong rally if it breaches INR 375 mark, while it can come down to INR 310-315 on the lower level. D2C brand Menhood parent Macobs Technologies became the  third new-age entity to list  on NSE Emerge this week, after TAC Infosec and Trust Fintech. Menhood\u2019s IPO  was oversubscribed 157.5X, with investors bidding for 40.89 Cr shares as against 25.95 Lakh shares on offer. The D2C brand got listed at INR 96 apiece, a 28% premium to its issue price of INR 75. Since its listing on Wednesday, the startup\u2019s share prices have spiked 9.84% to end the week at INR 105.45. It filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) in January 2024. Its IPO comprised a fresh issue of 25,95,200 equity shares of INR 10 each.\u00a0 Founded in 2019 by Dushyant Gandotra, Menhood offers a wide range of products in the male grooming and lifestyle segment, such as trimmers, intimate perfumes, intimate wash and moisturisers.",

Nazara Technologies, Nykaa, and Delhivery were also among the gainers this week.\u00a0 Meanwhile, 14 listed saw a decline in their share prices, falling in a range of under 0.1% to 11.27%. IndiaMART InterMESH, MapmyIndia, ixigo, and Go Digit were among the losers this week..\u00a0 ideaForge emerged as the biggest loser this week, with its shares plunging 11.27% to INR 735.40 over its weak Q1 numbers. The drone startup\u2019s  profit after tax (PAT) declined almost 94% to INR 1.2 Cr  from INR 18.9 Cr in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the broader market plummeted in the later part of the week after moving up earlier during the week. While Sensex ended the week 0.43% lower at 80,981.95, Nifty 50 declined 0.47% this week to end at 24,717.70.\u00a0 Commenting on the market trend, Geojit Financial Services\u2019 head of research Vinod Nair said that the market is displaying signs of fatigue at higher levels as most \u201cpositive factors have already been priced in\u201d. Adding to this is the global economic slowdown due to escalating trade tensions, conflicts in the Middle East, and persistently high inflation. \u201cGoing forward, the chances of further consolidation seem elevated due to premium valuations, weak Q1 results, and ongoing global market consolidation,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Echoing his sentiment, Mehta equities\u2019 senior VP (Research) Prashanth Tapse said that investors in domestic markets felt the impact of the global market situation and resorted to profit booking as recession fears re-emerged.\u00a0 \u201cDespite the slump, our resilient economy and strong fundamentals, along with healthy corporate earnings, would keep the downside limited. Technically speaking, the 25,000 mark for Nifty has now become a psychological hurdle and confirmation of strength can be seen only above that level,\u201d he said.\u00a0 In the coming week, all eyes will be on the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which will meet from August 6-8, Nair said.\u00a0 Amid all these, the  startup IPO boom  continues. Three startups \u2013 Ola Electric,  Unicommerce  and  FirstCr y \u2013 are set to list on the exchanges in the coming weeks. Ola Electric\u2019s IPO opened on August 2 and  received 35% subscription on the first day of bidding  on Friday. The EV maker has set a price band of INR 72-76 per equity share for the public issue. At the upper end of the price band, it would raise INR 6,145.6 Cr. In its IPO note, wealth management and investment advisory Devan Choksey gave Ola Electric\u2019s public offering a \u201csubscribe\u201d rating. It believes that Ola Electric\u2019s continued focus on fostering research and development will help it extend its market share in the two-wheeler EV category. It is pertinent to note that Ola Electric is already the market leader in the segment.\u00a0 \u201cThe company prioritises R&D and plans to continue launching next-generation EVs. The company\u2019s strategic initiatives include the development of the Ola Gigafactory and a focus on backward integration to enhance supply chain control and cost efficiency. Overall, the growth plans and cost efficiency initiatives justify the valuation,\u201d it said. FirstCry and Unicommerce\u2019s public offerings are set to open on August 6 and close on August 8. While FirstCry is set to raise INR 4,193 Cr at the upper end of its price band of INR 440-465, Unicommerce\u2019s IPO will see its shareholders sell shares worth INR 276.57 Cr.\u00a0 Overall, the total market capitalisation of the 25 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage stood at $67.91 Bn at the end of this week as against $63.27 Bn last week.\u00a0 With that said, here\u2019s a deeper look at the performance of the top three gainers this week.\u00a0 Zomato continued its run on the profit lane in the  first quarter of FY25 .

A total of 53.2 Mn shares changed hands cumulatively on the BSE and the NSE, a 14-fold rise from the stock\u2019s average weekly volume of 3.8 Mn shares.\u00a0 While Nykaa is yet to declare its Q1 financial numbers, the startup expects a strong  revenue growth of around 22-23%  YoY.\u00a0 \u201cOur beauty vertical\u2019s revenue growth for the quarter is expected to be around 22-23% YoY, similar to the consolidated entity\u2019s revenue growth. GMV growth is expected to be higher, in the high twenties YoY, in line with long-term BPC (Beauty & Personal Care) industry growth trajectory,\u201d the startup said in July. On its  investor da y in June, Nykaa said that it is aiming to achieve a mid-single-digit EBITDA margin by FY27 and then increase it to 10%. It also expects its BPC business to grow at a CAGR of mid-to-late 20% till FY28.\u00a0 Post this disclosure, JM Financial  raised its price target on Nykaa  to INR 230 from INR 220 earlier. ICICI Securities also upgraded the stock to \u2018add\u2019 from \u2018hold\u2019 and raised the target to INR 195 from INR 175 earlier.

        "Article Content": "In the fast-changing landscape of  modern workplaces , employee engagement has emerged as a critical factor for organisational success. Employees who are engaged are more productive, imaginative, and dedicated to their employers.\u00a0 Traditionally, HR departments have relied on surveys, feedback forms, and periodic reviews to gauge and enhance  employee engagement . However, the advent of  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionising this space , offering more dynamic, real-time, and personalised approaches to fostering engagement.\u00a0 This shift is particularly relevant in regions like India, where the 2024 Gallup State of the Global Workplace report highlighted that 86% of Indians felt they were either struggling or suffering\u2014significantly higher than the global average.\u00a0 Furthermore, only 14% of Indian employees reported feeling they were thriving, compared to the global average of 34%. These statistics underscore the urgent need for more effective engagement strategies, making AI a game-changer for industries worldwide. AI  has the potential to improve the employee experience by offering highly personalised engagement strategies. Through advanced data analytics, AI can analyse individual preferences, work patterns, and feedback, enabling organisations to tailor engagement initiatives to each employee.\u00a0 For example, AI-driven platforms can recommend personalised learning programs, suggest wellness activities, or customise recognition programs based on an employee\u2019s profile. This level of personalisation helps employees feel valued and understood, significantly enhancing their engagement levels. Traditional methods of gauging employee engagement, such as annual surveys, often miss out on capturing real-time sentiments. AI bridges this gap by offering continuous, real-time feedback and analytics.\u00a0 By analysing communication patterns and employee sentiment through natural language processing, AI can provide immediate insights into the workforce\u2019s mood and engagement levels. This enables  HR teams to address issues  proactively, make informed decisions, and implement timely interventions to maintain high engagement levels. One of the most powerful applications of AI in the workplace is predictive analytics. By analysing historical data, AI can predict trends and potential challenges related to employee engagement. For instance, it can identify patterns that may indicate a risk of high turnover or decreased productivity.\u00a0 With these insights, organisations can take proactive measures to address these issues before they escalate, thereby retaining top talent and maintaining a motivated workforce. Employee well-being is an important aspect of engagement, and AI plays a crucial role in encouraging it. AI-powered wellness programs can monitor and analyse employees\u2019 physical and mental health data to recommend personalised wellness activities, such as exercise routines, mindfulness sessions, or ergonomic improvements.\u00a0 Additionally, AI can provide early warning signs of burnout or stress, enabling organisations to take timely action to support their employees\u2019 well-being. The impact of AI on employee well-being and engagement has been demonstrated through data provided by Amara.ai. For instance, a client case study revealed that after implementing Amara\u2019s AI-driven engagement tools, the employee engagement score increased by 30% within six months.\u00a0 Additionally, key performance indicators (KPIs) showed a 25% rise in productivity across departments, and employee turnover rates decreased by 20% in the first year. These metrics highlight the significant role AI can play in enhancing employee well-being and overall organisational performance. The adoption of AI technologies in Southeast Asia and India is rapidly accelerating, fueled by the urgent need for digital transformation and a desire to enhance competitiveness on a global scale. According to a report by KPMG, AI investments in Southeast Asia saw a significant increase of 33% in 2022, underscoring the region\u2019s commitment to integrating advanced technologies.\u00a0 This trend is further supported by proactive government initiatives, with countries like Singapore and India taking the lead in national AI strategies. Singapore, for example, aims to deploy AI in critical sectors such as healthcare, transport, and education by 2030 as part of its National AI Strategy.\u00a0 In India, the AI workforce is growing swiftly, with LinkedIn\u2019s Emerging Jobs Report highlighting a 74% increase in AI Specialist roles over the past four years, making it one of the fastest-growing job categories in the country. \u00a0Additionally, a Gartner survey revealed that 59% of enterprises in Southeast Asia have already deployed or plan to deploy AI solutions within the next two years, highlighting the strategic importance of AI in business planning and operations across the region. In conclusion, the integration of AI in employee engagement strategies is not just a trend but a necessity in today\u2019s fast-paced and competitive business environment. By leveraging AI, organisations can create a more personalised, proactive, and efficient approach to engaging their workforce. This enhances productivity and innovation while fostering a positive and fulfilling work environment.\u00a0 As AI continues to evolve, its potential to transform employee engagement will only grow, making it an indispensable tool for organisations striving to achieve long-term success. Investing in AI-driven engagement tools ensures that employees are not just satisfied but truly engaged and motivated, paving the way for sustained growth and success in the ever changing business landscape.",

        "Article Content": "Since time immemorial, innovation has remained the pillar of the sports industry. Enhancing performance, captivating spectators, and improving accessibility are some of the ways in which this industry has evolved. Additionally, the emergence of  Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)  have also been game-changing for the sports industry.\u00a0 These  technologies are not only transforming  how athletes train and make strategies but also how spectators view sports. They not only increase the precision and effectiveness of training but also ensure that everyone enjoys and can become an indispensable part of sports. With respect to that aspect, this article delves into how AR and VR are changing the face of sports with regard to broadcasting and training. Traditionally, sports training relied on combining physical practice, manual analysis, and coach-driven feedback. Athletes sharpened their skills through repetition, while coaches offered guidance based on observation and experience. Although this approach was effective in its own right, it was limited by human error and the inability to precisely measure and analyse every detail about an athlete\u2019s performance. The introduction of technology has changed the game altogether. Through video analysis, coaches can now look back at match footage and use that as a basis for feedback. However, it was only after the rise of AR/VR technologies that things took off. Hence, these technologies provide athletes with simulated environments where they can improve their game with great accuracy and receive feedback in real-time. AR and VR technology are also revolutionising athletes\u2019 training methods. They provide athletes with life-like situations in which they can rehearse particular abilities, analyse their movements, and even simulate game scenarios. For example, virtual reality headsets enable athletes to make adjustments to their techniques and prepare psychologically for competition by simulating a real match situation. Similarly, augmented reality glasses can project important data like player movement patterns, helping them to make more informed decisions immediately. In addition, by utilising a virtual atmosphere for training, athletes are spared from the strain of doing repeated drills. Henceforth, the chance for overtraining is greatly diminished, and less time is wasted. Moreover, these tools can create a number of scenarios, like unfavorable climatic conditions or public outcry, thus helping competitors prepare for unique obstacles they may come across during a match. The effects of AR and VR go further than simple training. They are reshaping how sports are played by both athletes and fans alike. In terms of advantages, it is easy to see why more athletes are turning to AR and VR. Accessing immediate data and feedback helps athletes improve their techniques or tactical awareness more effectively than before. Coaches also benefit from such tools to a certain extent.\u00a0 For example, they can simulate game situations that help them develop appropriate methods under controlled conditions. This ability to experiment with varied tactics without the risk of losing a real game can be crucial during competitive sports events. Audiences, too, gain from AR and VR, as these technologies help spectators comprehend and engage better during live events. For example, AR can serve as an overlay to live broadcasts, thus allowing viewers to gain a deeper insight into the game through interesting statistics and insights. In tennis, for instance, fans may watch matches from the perspective of their favorite players, making the viewing experience more immersive and engaging. The  ability of AR  and VR to make sports accessible to a wider audience is their most important impact. In India, cricket was once the only sport that could be played widely because it was well-understood and followed. However, other sports have since gained popularity since the introduction of AR and VR. These technologies are dismantling the barriers that previously restricted access to sports. For instance, virtual reality (VR) can imitate sports experiences for the physically challenged, allowing them to participate in sports that were previously impossible. Conversely, augmented reality (AR) enhances events in real-time through captions or sign language interpretation for individuals with eyesight or hearing impediments. Furthermore, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are used to bring sports to regions and communities where conventional sporting facilities are limited. This allows individuals to experience and participate in sports without the need for expensive equipment or facilities because such technologies facilitate the creation of virtual environments. Injury prevention is another area where AR and VR are playing a significant role. Traditional training methodologies usually consist of monotonous tasks, which result in more injuries through overuse. Unlike before, with VR, athletes get an opportunity to practice these drills virtually, hence reducing the physical strain on their bodies. AR aids in lowering injury probabilities as it gives real-time feedback about an athlete\u2019s form and technique. For example, AR headsets can show if athletes have incorrect postures or movement patterns that could lead to an injury. This is important, especially in contact sports like rugby or American football, where a wicked approach could cause painful wounds. Besides this, VR is also being utilised in rehabilitation programs to facilitate better recovery. Athletes can regain their skills and self-belief using VR in an environment resembling the real world, lessening their chances of re-injury. Another sector that has undergone a major transformation through the use of augmented and virtual reality is sports broadcasting. These technologies have brought about an era in which sport can be better explained and appreciated by spectators. The use of AR enhances live telecasts by overlaying graphics, statistics, and other data on the screen. This helps viewers keep an eye on what\u2019s happening and, hence, better understand team and player strategies. On the other hand, virtual reality offers the ultimate immersive viewing experience. Using a VR headset, supporters can watch a match as if they were actually at the venue, feeling all the sights and sounds in real-time. This technological advancement is beneficial for sporting activities when one cannot physically attend such international competitions or those played in remote locations. The rise of augmented and virtual reality technologies is likely to evolve the world of sports as we know it. Future possibilities include a complete fusion of AR/VR across all aspects of sports, from training through injury prevention, broadcasting, and fan engagement. The potential of these technologies is immense, and their continued development will undoubtedly shape the future of sports. Both AR & VR will be well adopted by athletes, coaches, and fans to transform into a broader perspective for the sports industry. Today\u2019s sports are no longer defined by who wins on the field, instead, they have been given a new lease on life through technological interventions.",

        "Article Content": "New-age tech stocks witnessed a mixed week on the stock exchanges amid new startup listings and many  startups making a beeline to go public . Most of the listed startups saw stock specific action in the final week of the Q1 FY25 earnings season. Eleven of the 26 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage gained in a range of over 45% to a little under 1% this week.\u00a0 Recently listed electric two-wheeler maker Ola Electric emerged as the top gainer this week, with its shares surging 45.59% to end at INR 132.76. Other gainers included Paytm, Delhivery, Awfis, and Nyk2aa.\u00a0 On the other hand, 15 startups fell in a range of little under 10% to 0.37%. TBO Tek was the biggest loser this week. Its shares declined 9.23% to end the week at INR 1,572.40. ixigo, Honasa Consumer, and Nazara Technologies were among the other major new-age tech stocks which ended in the red.\u00a0 It is pertinent to note that markets were closed on August 15 on the occasion of India\u2019s 78th Independence day.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the broader market saw a revival after a short slump this week. While Sensex gained 0.9% this week to end at 80,436.84, Nifty 50 gained 0.7% to end the week at 24,541.15.\u00a0 Analysts attributed the market recovery over the week to a trickle down effect of recovery in the global markets. Prashanth Tapse, senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities, said that multiple factors improved the global market sentiment this week. \u201cPositive US economic data like cooling inflation and robust retail sales numbers shrugged off recession fears while talks of a rate cut by the US Fed as early as next month fuelled a mega rally across global equities, including India,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said that the end of the Q1 FY25 earnings season on a positive note drove the markets recovery this week.\u00a0 \u201cWe expect the earnings momentum to continue with a steady growth of 15% over the next two years (FY24-26). Softening in US PPI data has raised hopes of rate cuts in the US. Thus, all eyes next week will be on US Fed meeting minutes. Overall, we expect the market to consolidate in a broader range and take cues from global factors,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Amid all these, SaaS startup Unicommerce and omnichannel retail brand FirstCry made their market debuts on Tuesday (August 13). Shares of FirstCry\u2019s parent Brainbees Solutions opened at INR 625 on the BSE,  a premium of 34.4%  to the issue price. Unicommerce listed at INR 230 on the BSE, a  premium of 112.96% . Both the startups ended the week higher than their listing prices. Including the new additions, the total market capitalisation of 28 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage stood at $77.52 Bn at the end of the week. In comparison, the market capitalisation of 26 new-age tech stocks stood at $72.05 Bn last week.\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the performance of some of the new-age tech stocks this week.\u00a0 After a flat listing on the BSE, shares of Ola Electric have continued to march upwards on the bourses. After touching the upper circuit of 20% on its listing day last week, shares of Ola Electric ended this week 45.59% higher at INR 132.76.\u00a0 Here\u2019s a quick recap of the eventful week for Ola Electric as well as Ola Group:\u00a0 \u2013 The startup\u2019s net  loss rose 30% to INR 347 Cr  in the June quarter of the financial year 2024-25 (Q1 FY25) from INR 267 Cr in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile its operating revenue grew 32% to INR 1,644 Cr during the quarter under review from INR 1,243 Cr in Q1 FY24. \u2013 During Ola\u2019s annual \u201cSankalp\u201d event, founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal unveiled three  new motorcycles under Ola Electric\u2019s portfolio  \u2013 Roadster X, Roadster, and Roadster Pro. The bikes are priced in the range of INR 74,999 to INR 2,49,999. \u2013 During the event, Aggarwal also revealed cells made at the startup\u2019s Gigafactory. The company is scheduled to integrate these cells in its vehicles by Q1 FY26. While Ola Electric continues to be riddled with losses, the startup claimed to have recorded the highest sales of its vehicles in Q1. Geojit Financial Services\u2019 senior research analyst Saji John said that despite the loss in FY24, the company seems poised to achieve and enhance profitability in the long-term through improved scalability and vertical integration.\u00a0 Post its quarterly results and new product reveals, the startup\u2019s market cap stood at $6.98 Bn at the end of the week. \u201cWith the current market share of 38% YTD and robust capex plan, Ola Electric is likely to act as a catalyst for boosting investors\u2019 confidence and could help accelerate the growth and adoption of electric two-wheelers across the country,\u201d John said.\u00a0 Beauty and fashion ecommerce major Nykaa reported a 152% increase in its consolidated net profit to  INR 13.6 Cr in Q1 FY25  from INR 5.4 Cr in the same quarter last year. Operating revenue grew 22.8% to INR 1,746.1 Cr during the reported quarter from INR 1,421.8 Cr in Q1 FY24. In a post-earnings call, Nykaa MD and CEO Falguni Nayar attributed the improvement in net profit to recent restructuring efforts and other strategic measures. As a result of the strong Q1 show, Nykaa\u2019s shares  jumped as much as 5.8%  to INR 197.35 during the intraday trading session on August 14. The stock ended the week at INR 193.95, witnessing a 1.02% WoW increase.\u00a0 Commenting on the stock, Amol Athawale, VP of technical research at Kotak Securities, said that Nykaa\u2019s shares are trading around its 50-day moving average and expected to witness bullish market sentiment.\u00a0 \u201cIn the short-term time frame, Nykaa is witnessing consolidation. On the higher side, it is witnessing resistance at INR 202-204 and on the lower side 180-185 is the support area. Once it breaches the resistance area, we are of the view that Nykaa\u2019s shares can reach INR 210-215 in the near future,\u201d he said. B2B travel portal TBO Tek\u2019s consolidated net profit increased 29% to  INR 60.91 Cr in Q1 FY25  from INR 47.3 crore in the same period last year. Operating revenue grew 21% to INR 418.5 Cr during the quarter from INR 344.6 Cr in Q1 FY24.\u00a0 TBO Tek\u2019s gross transaction value (GTV) stood at INR 7,940 Cr in Q1, reflecting a 14% year-on-year growth. The hotel segment accounted for 57% of the GTV, while the air segment accounted for 43%. In comparison the hotel and air segments accounted for 46% and 54% of the GTV, respectively, in Q1 2024.\u00a0 However, the stock closed at INR 1,572.40 on Friday, with a weekly loss of 9.23%. This was in line with the decline seen in other travel tech companies like Yatra, ixigo, and EaseMyTrip amid rising global tensions.",

        "Article Content": "New-age tech stocks gained this week on a rally in the broader market due to positive global cues. Eighteen of the 28 new-age companies under Inc42\u2019s coverage rose in a range of 0.38% to just a little under 35% this week. Cybersecurity startup TAC Infosec, which is listed on NSE Emerge, was the biggest gainer this week. Its shares surged 34.42% to end the week at an all time high of INR 773.90. Other top gainers of the week included recently listed SaaS startup Unicommerce, coworking startup Awfis, last week\u2019s top loser TBO Tek, and Mamaearth parent Honasa Consumer.\u00a0 Beauty and fashion ecommerce major Nykaa touched a fresh 52-week high twice during the week. The stock surged more than 9% to hit a fresh 52-week high of INR 229.9 apiece on the BSE during the intraday trading on August 23. Amid the bull run, its early investor Harindarpal Singh Banga offloaded around 4.1 Cr shares worth INR 851.5 Cr in a bulk deal on Friday. Overall, shares of Nykaa ended the week 16.99% higher/lower at INR 226.90on the BSE. Meanwhile, 10 new-age tech stocks fell in a range of 0.20% to just under 5% this week. Last week\u2019s top gainer Ola Electric emerged as the biggest loser, falling 4.93% to end the week at INR 126.21. In the broader market, Sensex grew 0.8% to end the week at 81,086.21 and Nifty 50 jumped 1.1% to end at 24,823.15.\u00a0 Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, said multiple global factors, including diminished likelihood of a recession in the US, ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, and decline in crude oil price, led to the rise in the benchmark indices.\u00a0 \u201cHowever, inflationary pressure in Japan and the appreciation of the yen tempered the market\u2019s gains at the end,\u201d he added. Among the recently listed new-age tech companies, Unicommerce ended the week with 19.09% gains. Meanwhile, FirstCry ended in the red. It is pertinent to mention that startups like Swiggy,  BlackBuck ,  Avanse Financial Services ,  Ecom Express ,  ArisInfra , among others, are awaiting the market regulator\u2019s nod to make their  public market debut . Commenting on the surge in IPOs, Pantomath Capital Advisors said,\u00a0 \u201cA confluence of factors has boosted India\u2019s primary market. The biggest reason is India\u2019s strong macro environment, which has raised investor confidence. The healthy performance of several new stocks in the last couple of years has also lured investors into investing in new IPOs.\u201d Overall, the total market capitalisation of 28 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage stood at $81.39 Bn at the end of this week as against $77.52 Bn last week.\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the performance of some of the new-age tech stocks this week.\u00a0 Following months of speculation, foodtech major Zomato announced the acquisition of the entertainment ticketing business of Paytm for INR 2,048 Cr in an all-cash deal this week.\u00a0 With the acquisition, Zomato is looking to scale up its third B2C business, going out, with the  launch of its new app \u2018District\u2019 . On the other hand, Paytm said that the move to sell the ticketing business will help it focus on its core payments and financial services distribution business.\u00a0 However, the deal seemed to have failed to enthuse the investors, as shares of both Zomato and Paytm ended in the red this week. Zomato ended the week at INR 262.70, down 0.68% week-on-week. This was despite the startup touching a  fresh 52-week high of INR 280  at the beginning of the week.\u00a0 Antfin Singapore Holding Pte Ltd, an investor in Zomato, also offloaded nearly half of its stake in the foodtech major in two block deals worth INR 4,771 Cr on August 20.\u00a0 Brokerages\u2019 response for Zomato\u2019s acquisition of Paytm\u2019s ticketing vertical were largely positive. Emkay gave Zomato a price target of INR 270 by June 2025. Motilal Oswal maintained its \u2018BUY\u2019 rating for Zomato, with a target of INR 300.\u00a0 \u201cDistrict app could be a small part of Zomato\u2019s business, but if executed correctly, it could give Zomato a strong mind share in the spending patterns of urban consumers across key forms of recreational or staple spending: groceries, food, and recreational \u201cGoing out\u201d activities spanning dining, movies, sports, and music,\u201d Motilal Oswal said.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Paytm declined 1.67% this week to end at INR 554.50. Post the announcement, Emkay gave Paytm parent One97 Communications a \u2018Reduce\u2019 rating and a price target of INR 375. Motilal Oswal gave a  neutral rating with a target of INR 550 . On a bull run since its listing in May, shares of Awfis zoomed this week and reached an  all-time high of INR 909.75 apiece  on August 22. This marked a 110% increase from its listing price of INR 435. The shares of the startup ended the week with a gain of 25.18% at INR 900.45.\u00a0 This surge came after the startup announced the launch of two new centres at Mantri Commerce and Vista Pixel in Bengaluru.\u00a0 \u201cWe are confident that the demand for high-end workspaces will continue to surge in the years to come. Our new centres are strategically located to cater to this growing need, offering unparalleled amenities, cutting edge infrastructure, and a vibrant community that nurtures innovation and collaboration,\u201d Awfis chairman and MD Amit Ramani said. Awfis operates 1,12,038 seats across 185 centres in 17 cities currently. Moving ahead, it plans to further expand across India by adding 40,000 new seats in FY25, taking the total seat count to 1,35,000. Shares of cybersecurity startup TAC Infosec zoomed 34.42% this week to end at INR 773.90. The jump came after the company\u2019s update on new customer additions on August 19.\u00a0 TAC Infosec said it acquired 250 new customers in July and 590 in the first quarter of financial year 2024-25 (Q1 FY25).\u00a0 While 149 of the new clients came from the US, the company also onboarded 20 new clients from India, including Cars24. Moving forward, TAC Security is looking to build on this momentum by upselling additional products and services to its newly acquired clients.\u00a0 The startup\u2019s clients include Salesforce, MPL Gaming, Zepto, Juspay, Reliance ADA Group, among others. It has set a target to have 10,000 customers globally by March 2026 and 3,000 by March 2025.\u00a0 In a bid to bolster its global expansion bid, the startup also informed the bourses of its intent to  acquire US-based cybersecurity firm Cyber Sandia .\u00a0 \u201cCyber Sandia holds a critical State-Wide Agreement with the State of New Mexico for IT Professional Services, which makes this strategic acquisition a key opportunity for TAC Security to significantly bolster its presence in the U.S. public sector. This will also enable the company to expand its cybersecurity services nationwide across the US\u2014the largest market in the world,\u201d the company said in a release. TAC Infosec reported a  net profit of INR 6.33 Cr in FY24 , a jump of 23% from INR 5.12 Cr in FY23.\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Despite a prolonged bull run in the Indian stock markets, investors turned bearish on new-age tech stocks in the final week of August. Seventeen of the 28 stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage fell in a range of 0.33% to over 16%.\u00a0 Awfis emerged as the biggest loser this week, with its shares crashing 16.38% to end at INR 749.05. Last week\u2019s top gainer TAC Infosec, Zomato, Ola Electric were among the other major stocks which declined this week. Meanwhile, 11 new-age tech stocks rose in a range of just under 1% to over 12% this week. While Paytm emerged as the top gainer, Go Digit, TBO Tek, PB Fintech, and Honasa were among the other winners this week.\u00a0 It must be mentioned that two startups touched fresh all-time highs this week. Shares of Mamaearth parent Honasa touched  an all-time high of INR 528.9  on Monday (August 26) and ended the week 8.52% higher at INR 506.05 on the BSE. TAC Infosec extended its bull run into the first half of the week, with its shares touching an  all-time high of INR 853.15  on Tuesday (August 27). However, the cybersecurity SaaS startup\u2019s shares lost steam in the latter part of the week. Overall, the stock declined 3.73% this week to end at INR 745. In the broader market, Sensex grew 1.5% to end the week at 81,086.21 and Nifty 50 jumped 1.6% to end at 25,235.90.\u00a0 Motilal Oswal Financial Services\u2019 research head Siddhartha Khemka attributed Moody\u2019s upgrading India\u2019s GDP growth forecast to 7.2% for 2024 and 6.6% for 2025 from the earlier estimates of 6.8% and 6.4%, respectively, as one of the reasons for the rally this week. \u201cThis (GDP forecast update) and healthy MSCI inflow took markets to new highs. We expect the market to continue its northbound journey with stock-specific action,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Meanwhile, D2C meat delivery startup Zappfresh became the latest new-age business to join the queue for a public listing. Earlier this week, its parent DSM Fresh Foods Ltd filed its  draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) for listing  on the SME platform of the BSE, BSE SME.\u00a0 On the IPO trend, Pantomath Capital Advisors said that 17 companies filed their DRHPs with SEBI in the month of August, making it the highest number of monthly filings in over a year. Pantomath anticipates this trend to continue for the remainder of the year.\u00a0 \u201cRecently listed IPOs have  performed exceptionally well , boosting confidence among both companies and investors. This renewed optimism is prompting investors to look at opportunities in the primary market and driving promoters to raise funds through IPOs,\u201d it said.\u00a0 Overall, the total market capitalisation of 28 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage stood at $80.19 Bn at the end of this week as against $81.39 Bn last week.\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the performance of some of the new-age tech stocks this week.\u00a0 Paytm, which has been hit by regulatory troubles this year, saw a couple of positive developments bolster investor sentiment towards the stock. Shares of Paytm gained 12.14% this week to close at INR 621.80. Here\u2019s more on the developments:\u00a0 Getting the PA licence will help the company add new customers for providing online payment aggregation services.\u00a0 In a report, brokerage Jefferies said that the immediate business impact of the licence could be marginal for Paytm. However, it has a price target (PT) of INR 420 on the stock, representing nearly 32% downside from its last close. Besides, Motilal Oswal, on the Zomato-Paytm deal, said that the sale of the entertainment business would offer a financial boost to Paytm, generating significant cash that can be reinvested into other high-potential areas. It maintained a \u2018Neutral\u2019 rating on Paytm with a PT of INR 550, and expects the company to turn EBITDA positive by FY27. After an extended bull run on the bourses, shares of recently listed coworking space provider Awfis crashed this week.\u00a0 The startup\u2019s shares plunged 16.38% to end the week at INR 749.05. Earlier on August 22, the stock had touched an all-time high of INR 945.70.\u00a0 During the week, Awfis announced a partnership with Nyati Group to set up an additional 3 Lakh square feet of Grade-A workspace in Pune. Through the partnership, Awfis will introduce premium flexible workspaces in Nyati Group\u2019s commercial properties of Nyati Empress in Pune\u2019s Viman Nagar and Nyati Enthral in Kharadi. It will add 1,67,206 square feet of built up office space in the city.\u00a0 Awfis currently offers 1,12,038 seats across 185 centres in 17 cities. Moving forth, the startup plans to further expand across India by adding 40,000 new seats in FY25, taking the total seat count to 1,35,000. On Friday (August 30), recently listed kids-focussed omnichannel retailer FirstCry and SaaS startup Unicommerce released their first financial results post their listing on the bourses earlier this month.\u00a0 FirstCry\u2019s parent Brainbees Solutions  reduced its consolidated net loss by 31%  to INR 75.68 Cr in Q1 FY25 from INR 110.42 Cr a year ago. Operating revenue increased 10% to INR 1,652.07 Cr from INR 1,496.93 Cr in Q1 FY24.\u00a0 The company\u2019s consolidated adjusted EBITDA surged 106% YoY to INR 74.3 Cr, with GMV rising 17% YoY to INR 2,318.3 Cr. FirstCry said it plans to invest INR 100 Cr in its UAE subsidiary to boost operations in the UAE as well as Saudi Arabia. The company released its financial numbers after market hours. Prior to that, its shares closed at INR 641.40, which was a gain of 0.45% on a weekly basis. Meanwhile, Unicommerce reported a  31% increase in profit after tax (PAT)  to INR 3.51 Cr in Q1 FY25 from INR 2.68 Cr in the same quarter last year.\u00a0 Revenue from contracts with customers grew 9.2% year-on-year to INR 27.46 Cr, while total expenses rose 7% to INR 24.28 Cr. Further, its EBITDA surged 61% to INR 4.2 Cr, with EBITDA margin expanding to 15.3% from 10.4% a year ago.\u00a0 Unicommerce also declared its numbers after the close of the market.

        "Article Content": "Indian new-age tech stocks saw a mixed week on the bourses amid a slump in the broader domestic equities market due to global market volatility. Fifteen of the 28 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage fell in a range of 0.3% to 10% during the week, with Unicommerce emerging as the biggest loser. Meanwhile, shares of DroneAcharya declined 8.9%, followed by Ola Electric\u2019s shares nosediving about 7.1% during the week. Among the other top losers were Menhood, ixigo, Paytm, PB Fintech, Yudiz, and MapmyIndia \u2013 all down between 3% and 5%. Yatra, ideaForge, Delhivery, and FirstCry declined more than 2% but below 3% this week. On the other hand, NSE Emerge-listed TAC Infosec emerged as the biggest gainer this week, with its shares rallying 10.6%. Among the other 12 gainers during the week were CarTrade, Mamaearth, Nykaa, Zomato, Awfis, and TBO Tek, with their shares rising in the range of 2% to 7%. In the broader market, Sensex fell 1.43% to end the week at 81,183.93 and Nifty 50 declined 1.52% to end at 24,852.15. On Friday (September 6), Sensex and Nifty 50 declined 1.24% and 1.17%, respectively. Speaking on the broader market slump, Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, said that the domestic market came under pressure on Friday as SEBI\u2019s deadline over disclosure norms for FIIs neared. However, this would not impact India\u2019s lucrativeness to FIIs in the long term, he said.\u00a0\u00a0 Besides, elevated valuations continue to be a concern and the indices are expected to witness a muted trend in the short term, Nair added. Meanwhile, Siddhartha Khemka, head of research, wealth management, at Motilal Oswal, said that the domestic equities experienced the most significant single-day decline over the past month on Friday due to concerns over a potential slowdown in the US labour market.\u00a0 \u201cWe expect consolidation mode to continue in the market over the near term,\u201d Khemka added. Despite the volatility, the IPO optimism remains high. As per reports,  Ather Energy is set to file a DRHP with the SEBI for an INR 4,000 Cr+ public offering , almost a month after the INR 6,000 Cr+ IPO of its rival EV player Ola Electric. Now, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the performance of the new-age tech stocks this week. Overall, the total market capitalisation of 28 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage stood at around $79.38 Bn as against $80.19 Bn at the end of last week. In an interesting development, online travel aggregator  EaseMyTrip announced incorporating a new wholly owned subsidiary Easy Green Mobility  to start electric bus manufacturing. It is looking to invest INR 200 Cr for R&D, product development, and setting up a manufacturing plant over the next 2-3 years.\u00a0 While Easy Green Mobility will manufacture ebuses, EaseMyTrip will operate these buses via its other subsidiary YoloBus. The shares of EaseMyTrip, which have remained volatile with a downward trend since the beginning of the year, jumped over 12% following the announcement on Thursday and ended the day\u2019s trading around 11% higher at INR 43.08 on the BSE. However, the shares slumped the next day to end the week over 6% lower at INR 40.42.\u00a0 Shares of recently listed Unicommerce slumped in all five trading sessions this week after  posting its Q1 FY25 earnings  last Friday (August 30). With a sharp decline of a little over 10% during the week, the SaaS startup turned out to be the biggest loser. Unicommerce shares ended the week at INR 197.25 on the BSE. It is pertinent to note that the startup\u2019s profit after tax (PAT) jumped 31% year-on-year to INR 3.51 Cr in Q1 FY25. Even on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis, profit rose 22%. Meanwhile, revenue from contract with customers increased 9.2% YoY and 3.5% QoQ to INR 27.46 Cr during Q1. The sudden fall in its share price could be due to profit booking. Unicommerce made its debut on the bourses at a whopping 113% premium to its issue price. Currently, the shares are trading 14.2% lower than the listing price of INR 230 on the BSE but 82.6% higher than the issue price of INR 108 apiece. Shares of foodtech major Zomato, which have surged over the past year or so over its increasing profits and plans to diversify revenue stream, again received thumbs up from brokerages this week. CLSA raised its price target (PT) on Zomato  to INR 353 from INR 350, which currently implies an upside of about 36% to its last close. The brokerage said that its PT increase was to reflect Zomato\u2019s recent acquisition of Paytm ticketing business. Besides, it also said, \u201cQuick commerce is reshaping India\u2019s retail supply chain by flattening distribution, giving new brands increased visibility and price competitiveness. Blinkit\u2019s parent Zomato will be the largest listed beneficiary, while staples marketers Marico and Hindustan Unilever face risks as their distribution advantage erodes.\u201d CLSA also sees Zomato\u2019s Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart reaching $10 Bn in gross order value by FY26 and surpassing $78 Bn within a decade. Meanwhile, JP Morgan also raised Zomato\u2019s PT to INR 340 from INR 208 earlier, implying about a 31% upside to the stock\u2019s last close, on the back of the company\u2019s quick commerce growth.\u00a0 In line with the increase in PTs, shares of Zomato jumped over 7% in the last two trading sessions during the week. The stock ended Friday\u2019s trading at INR 260.05 on the BSE, gaining 3.7% overall during the week. Continuing its spree of experiments, Zomato announced the launch of \u2018dark mode\u2019 this week. Its rival, IPO-bound Swiggy also seems to be on the experimentation mode and has launched a number of new features and services over the past few months. This week,  Inc42 reported  that Swiggy is piloting a large order fleet in the Delhi NCR region.",

        "Article Content": "After two years of unmitigated growth powered by the rocket fuel of FOMO-driven funding, India\u2019s startups are facing a reckoning. With  startup funding plunging to 2020 levels , volatility in public markets and the US economy on the verge of entering a recession, the world is looking at similar conditions as the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008. However, the present moment might also be the best time to build a startup. Flipkart, Dream11, Policybazaar, EaseMyTrip and Zomato \u2013 all storied names in India\u2019s startup ecosystem \u2013 were founded during the height of the GFC when global markets were facing an extinction-level event. The crucible that is the current market will forge companies that will make headlines throughout the next decade. Startup funding is in a freefall zone and investors have tightened their purse strings significantly, making selective deals. However, the bullishness for early bets remains as high as ever. We have always had the opportunity to discover the market leaders of tomorrow with \u2018the  30 Startups To Watch\u2019  column, and this endeavour holds more prominence right now. Recognising the immense responsibility we have on our shoulders, we took a step back, talked with startups and  investors backing them  and reprioritised what kind of startups need the spotlight the most today. After spending two months on the drawing board, we have returned with the 38th edition of \u2018 30 Startups To Watch\u2019  with a sharp focus on sustainability, echoing the sentiment across global markets. No startup that was selected has raised more than $4 Mn in funding, with many securing less than $500K in investment and still turning a profit. While these 30 companies employ more than 650 employees cumulatively, 17 startups have 20 employees or less. The list is loaded with fintech, ecommerce and enterprise tech ventures, with a total of 20 startups. We have also featured startups from the currently relevant fields of generative AI and semiconductors, with one startup each from the two red-hot industries. More interestingly, the 38th edition of \u2018 30 Startups To Watch\u2019  features 17 startups operating in the B2B space and only eight ventures making waves in the B2C segment. The remaining five startups hold the B2B2C flag. In our most recent editions of this series, we have witnessed a growing wave of startups catering to other businesses. Usually, these startups are either already profitable or are about to turn a profit, which ensures better exit opportunities for investors who have burnt their fingers already and are looking to make safer bets. For Indian startups, however, the present is anything but the time to play it safe. With that, we bring you the 38th edition of the 30 Startups To Watch list by Inc42. Editor\u2019s Note:  The list below is not meant to be a ranking of any kind. We have listed the startups alphabetically. Coffee is undeniably one of the most beloved beverages in India, with coffee chains like Starbucks, Tim Hortons, and Cafe Coffee Day being quite popular. However, the prices at these chains have been notoriously high, with markups reaching as much as 1,700%. That remains true with the presence of local speciality coffee chains, even as India is the world\u2019s eighth-largest exporter and the fifth-largest producer of coffee. Having experienced European coffee for many years and after extensive research on Indian coffee varieties and roasting techniques, Abhijeet Anand started abCoffee in 2022 from a single outlet in Mumbai. The startup has nine tech-enabled, grab-and-go outlets in Mumbai, with one coming up in Delhi NCR soon. abCoffee prides itself on its efficient service, claiming that customers can get their favourite beverage and be on their way in just 90 seconds, provided they place an order right before arriving at the outlet.\u00a0 The QSR coffee chain sources green beans from across the country and roasts per its in-house recipe. abCoffee has 95+ SKUs across five categories, including hot and cold beverages and ground coffee. The startup has multiple revenue streams, including direct sales via its QSR outlets, online sales via delivery partners like Swiggy, Zomato, Magicpin and Dunzo and online orders via the website. So far, abCoffee claims to have sold 103K+ cups of coffee to more than 31,000 customers. It reported an ARR of INR 3.4 Cr as of July 2023. In the short term, abCoffee plans to expand to major urban hubs of the country, with 323 outlets by 2024. By 2026, the startup plans to set up more than 6,650 outlets across India, with an ARR of INR 6,656 Cr. According to a 2021  report  by the Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs and Public Distribution, India lost around 412K metric tonnes of wheat and rice between 2017 and 2021, owing to poor transportation and logistics. For context, the amount of food grains lost in transit could have fed 82.3 Mn people for a month. To alleviate the issues shrouding the sorry state of grain logistics in India, Udit Sangwan and Charu Chaturvedi founded Agrigator in 2019. Similar to Uber or Ola, Agrigator acts as a platform that connects grain traders and small-scale millers with on-spot logistics services. Truck drivers can sign up on the platform to offer their services, similar to how ride-hailing companies operate. Since its inception, Agrigator has onboarded more than 2,000 truck drivers. The startup offers multiple services to its customers, including guaranteed truck confirmations within an average of 28 minutes and freight discovery through its freight prediction model, which is patent-pending in India. Agrigator has its supply network in four states to enable the pan-India movement of grain. In the last three months, the logistics startup has achieved significant milestones, including 9,000 trips and increasing its matching fees from 2.5% to 6%, amassing a user base of 24,000 clients.\u00a0 They have also joined hands with an NBFC to expedite payments. Agrigator takes a certain percentage from the payment received by each truck through its platform, making way for the Bhopal-based startup\u2019s core revenue stream. By 2024, Agrigator is looking to increase its revenue by 8% YoY. Per the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, there were 14.39 Mn MSMEs in India as of February 2023, with more than 99% being micro and small enterprises. These businesses have limited access to financing, which limits their growth. Pankaj Goel, a chartered accountant, saw an opportunity in the supply chain finance segment for distributors, retailers and MSMEs, which inspired him to start CapitalSetu in 2020. Today, Goel runs the startup with his wife Ayushi and Yogesh Vaishnav, a family friend and the startup\u2019s CTO. CapitalSetu\u2019s offerings comprise six products, three fintech and three SaaS. Its flagship product, SetuX, is aimed at providing supply chain financing to businesses. With SetuX, the startup helps MSMEs increase the pace of their cash flow by releasing \u2018early payouts\u2019 against their invoices. Further, while the startup\u2019s SetuPay is a peer-to-peer invoice discounting platform, which enables faster payment cycles, its SetuDyna solution offers a dynamic discounting platform through which MSMEs can offer early payment discounts to their respective suppliers. CapitalSetu\u2019s SaaS product SetuFi is a tally reports and dashboards mobile app. Similarly, its SetuTIP is an app-based trade intelligence platform that offers credit assessments, GST reports, ITR reports, banking reports, and bureau assessments. The startup also offers an order management system, SetuBiz. CapitalSetu generates revenue through its supply chain finance operations by charging interest and through SaaS subscriptions.\u00a0 The startup has disbursed INR 250 Cr so far, a quarter of its 2024 target of INR 1,000 Cr loan book in supply chain financing for MSMEs. By 2026, CapitalSetu aims to take disbursals to INR 5,000 Cr across 1 Lakh MSMEs in India. Traditionally, wealth management has been a mostly manual process with limited automation and outdated reporting methods. Due to the unavailability of tech-enabled solutions, the requirements of HNIs and UHNIs have often remained underserved in this segment. In addition, independent financial advisors (IFAs) today need help in scaling up their services amid a dearth of tech solutions.\u00a0 With India\u2019s wealth management market set to reach $429.70 Bn in assets under management (AUM) in 2023, the lack of tech in the space is telling. Having worked with single-family offices and UHNIs for over 20 years, Manu Awasthy founded Centricity. The startup offers plug-and-play solutions for IFAs looking to make the transition to the wealth management space or scale their businesses. For HNIs, UHNIs and single-family offices, it offers a suite of tools for efficient wealth management.\u00a0 Centricity primarily focuses on two products \u2013 OneDigital and Invictus. While OneDigital is a digital infrastructure platform for IFAs, Invictus is an insights-generating tool designed for single-family offices (SFOs). OneDigital enables onboarding, KYC processes, multi-asset transactions, comprehensive investment product listings and comparison tools. Invictus, on the other hand, enables SFOs to assess investment risks, implement policy guardrails, and create asset allocation. The startup\u2019s revenue accruals come from commissions generated from asset management companies/product manufacturers and fee incomes on secondary bond trades with clients. Centricity\u2019s short-term plans for 2024 include scaling the technology team, expanding its physical presence, enhancing the product bouquet by adding more products and growing key metrics such as the number of digital partners, product penetration, AUM for OneDigital, and the number of families on the Invictus platform. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 35% of Indians do not get enough protein. Further, the livestock industry is responsible for about 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, solidifying the case for plant-based alternatives for protein. To bridge   the protein gap and make the most of this opportunity, Roma Roy Choudhury and Pradeep Rao established their plant-based protein startup, Evolved Foods. The founders got the inspiration for the startup from their personal experiences, including a visit to Singapore in 2014 and the subsequent launch of their restaurant in Bengaluru. Evolved Plant Meat, the flagship product of Evolved Foods, is a 100% vegetarian product that offers 15 gms of protein per 100 gms of serving, has zero cholesterol, and does not contain any animal-derived ingredients. The startup uses soy, coconut and rice protein to manufacture plant-based protein alternatives. Recently, Evolved Foods also entered the heat-and-serve food category to celebrate the rich regional culinary heritage of India with dishes such as Hyderabadi dum biryani, Chettinad fry, dhaba-style tandoori tikka and Kashmiri rogan josh curry. The startup operates on a B2B business model, selling its products to 25-plus clients in the food service industry. It is also finalising the launch of its products in the overseas markets and its short-term goal is to start exporting the products soon. In the long term, Evolved Foods aims to focus on developing more plant-based protein alternatives while immortalising Indian cuisine. According to an IBEF  report , India\u2019s pharmaceuticals industry is expected to reach $65 Bn by 2024 in market size, further expanding to nearly $130 Bn by 2030. A significant chunk of the industry consists of regular chemist shops across India\u2019s towns and cities.\u00a0 However, with the rise of online pharmacies, there is a need for financial solutions for small pharma business owners, retailers, and distributors to enable them to compete with major online pharmacies. Amit Chawla and Shreeram Ramanathan, having recognised the gap in the market, founded Fundly.ai in 2021 in Mumbai.\u00a0 Fundly.ai, which operates at the intersection of supply chain and MSME finance, empowers pharma distribution tail, speciality players and brands by providing them with affordable financial solutions. Fundly.ai\u2019s platform streamlines the financing process, making it easier for retailers and distributors to access funds for their operations.\u00a0 Fundly.ai offers two products \u2013 invoice payment and InstaCash. The former allows small pharma distributors to pay the invoices in advance. InstaCash, on the other hand, is a direct line of credit offered by Fundly.ai to non-registered distributors and small pharma businesses. The startup has empowered more than 2,000 retailers and 30-plus distributors across 9+ cities and has so far disbursed more than INR 140 Cr in credit. The company plans to deepen engagement with existing customers, invest in technology development, and introduce new product offerings in the short term, on the back of its recent $3 Mn seed fundraise. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the veterinary healthcare market in India is projected to reach $1.86 Bn by 2028. Despite this potential, Indian farmers continue to face challenges in accessing healthcare services for their livestock, as only one government-certified veterinary professional is available for every 21,000 cattle. This scarcity of veterinary care has resulted in a high animal mortality rate, decreased productivity, and significant negative impacts on the profitability of over 120 Mn farmers engaged in cattle rearing. Having experienced the bleak realities of rural livestock healthcare while helping their families with livestock management during the Covid-19 pandemic, Harish Phalswalm, Naveen Shokeen, Prince Yadav and Krishna Sharma founded GrowAgro in 2022 to address the gap in the system. The startup has developed a mobile app that offers farmers multiple healthcare services for their livestock. The app focuses on preventive healthcare, breeding assistance and nutritional consultation. It uses AI-based image recognition technology, which allows farmers to upload images of their cattle to detect potential health risks and get treatment recommendations. Along with nutrition plans for animals, the app offers AI-enabled solutions for breeding healthier and more productive animals. GrowAgro\u2019s app also facilitates consultations with experienced veterinarians and livestock experts when need be. GrowAgro charges a consultation fee for personalised expert consultations and offers premium subscriptions to users. Further, the startup earns commissions from every transaction that happens on the app. Currently, the startup is conducting a pilot in one district of Haryana and plans to expand gradually across North India soon. Creating high-quality marketing content can be expensive, especially if it involves hiring professional photographers or designers. While the pricing differs across categories and can cost heavily with images edited as per the style guides of various ecommerce platforms. Hexo.ai, founded by Kunal Bhatia and Vignesh Baskaran in 2022, uses a proprietary generative AI engine trained on a massive dataset of images, creatives, and marketing data to help businesses solve these challenges. The AI engine allows the startup to generate customised, high-quality, and realistic creatives. The startup\u2019s product suite includes a product photography generator, a creatives generator, a personalisation engine, an expenditure strategist and a variations generator for all visual needs of an ecommerce brand. These tools can help businesses save time and money on marketing while also creating more effective and engaging content. Hexo.ai\u2019s generative AI can also help companies track the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns and make necessary adjustments. While Hexo.ai is in the pre-revenue stage, it plans to monetise its product suite through a subscription model. Users will be able to subscribe to Hexo.ai\u2019s services on a monthly or annual basis. Over the past few years, Indian consumers have been increasingly incorporating healthier food options in their diets, given a steep rise in the cases of lifestyle-related diseases. That has helped the health foods market to expand at a CAGR of 20%, and according to a  report by Avendus Capital , this sector will reach $30 Bn in size by 2026. Increased demand for healthier snacking options enabled Dr Ridhi Kaur to launch Kikibix, a D2C brand offering healthy snacking options like cookies and peanut butter, in 2022. The Gurugram-based D2C startup has developed 12 types of cookies and three peanut butter flavours. Kikibix claims its cookies are baked using whole grains and don\u2019t contain wheat, gluten, palm oil, refined sugar and artificial sweeteners. So far, the D2C startup has served 20,000-plus customers, and its products are available on its website and major online channels, having recently boarded the quick commerce bus with Blinkit. With a team of 5-7 people, Kikibix claims to have grown 8X YoY. The startup\u2019s short-term plans include launching two new product lines \u2013 nuts and namkeens \u2013 and expanding the catalogue to 30-50 SKUs across five categories by 2024. In the long run, Kikibix aims to go omnichannel and onboard a brand ambassador by 2026. In the burgeoning landscape of Indian D2C brands, the majority outsource their production due to the high investment required for in-house manufacturing. However, Leumas has emerged as a game-changer for D2C brands in nutraceuticals, health supplements, skincare, hair care, oral care and healthy foods. Founded by Nitesh Kumar and Subhajit Biswas in Bengaluru, Leumas offers a unique solution that allows D2C brands to manufacture goods as per their demand. By leveraging Leumas\u2019 scalable production capacity, brands can access flexible batch sizes and efficiently produce multiple products. Central to Leumas\u2019 offering is its innovative tech stack, integrated with its manufacturing facilities. D2C brands can now upload their product recipes to the cloud, enabling Leumas to manufacture precisely according to each brand\u2019s demand. At the heart of their services lies the flagship product, Leumasware, an on-cloud manufacturing suite that empowers D2C companies to design, develop, and manage new products. Additionally, it enables seamless production and quality control while maintaining a digital inventory that enhances supply chain visibility. Not stopping there, Leumas goes the extra mile by offering expert assistance to D2C startups venturing into specific product classes, helping them bring their envisioned products to life. After China, India is on its course to becoming one of the largest manufacturing hubs in the world. Per World Bank data, India\u2019s manufacturing gross value add (GVA) stood at $450 Bn during 2022, compared to China\u2019s $4.98 Tn and Japan\u2019s $1.02 Tn. Despite this, manufacturing units in India continue to face a slew of challenges in areas like capacity utilisation, quality control and supply chain management, leading to high customer churn and challenges in exporting their goods. To bridge this widening gap between Indian factories and global markets, Neal Thakkar founded Magma in 2021. A B2B manufacturing platform in the building materials space, Magma helps factories with procurement, manufacturing and sales to compete with their global counterparts. By leveraging Magma\u2019s mobile app and its web-based platform, factory owners can streamline their operations, connect with and manage suppliers, optimise and track logistics, and enable a consistent energy supply. The startup operates on a commission-based business model, generating revenue through margins earned on the products sold via its platform. Magma claims to have onboarded 110-plus clients across 12 states in India, making an annualised gross merchandise value (GMV) of INR 200 Cr in the past three months. Magma\u2019s plans for 2024 include expanding its product offerings by increasing the number of SKUs available on its platform and serving more factories. By 2026, the startup aims to expand into verticals beyond construction materials. Maya Programming is a complex and time-consuming task, and many who lack technical know-how may find it difficult to learn. Bengaluru-based Maya Labs, founded by Sibesh Kar and Shubham Mishra in 2020, is solving this problem by developing a program synthesis engine called PAC-1 that can convert natural language instructions into computer codes. This allows users to instruct machines to perform tasks without having to write codes. At the enterprise level, Maya Labs\u2019 PAC-1 helps software engineers focus on more complex tasks such as developing new features or fixing bugs. Maya Labs plans to monetise its product through a subscription model. Users can subscribe to the startup\u2019s service and use PAC-1. The startup also plans to offer enterprise-level pricing for businesses that need to automate large volumes of tasks. Throughout 2021 and 2022, the world witnessed a massive shortage of semiconductor chips, impacting industries across the globe. This came as a wake-up call for countries like India, which are heavily dependent on China and Taiwan for these chips. While the supply chain has stabilised in recent months, there is still a problem of overdesigned chips. At a time when many global chip designers are looking to develop the next-fastest chip, there is a large section of engineers working on mid-range applications like IoT, computer vision and automobiles with outdated, inefficient and expensive tech. Understanding the challenges faced by system engineers, Shashwath TR and Sharan Srinivas J founded Mindgrove Technologies in 2021 to provide SoCs (systems on chips) for mid-range use applications. The cofounders worked at IIT Madras\u2019 Reconfigurable Intelligent Systems Engineering (RISE) Lab \u2014 while Shahwath was a systems engineer, Sharan was a PhD student at RISE Lab. Mindgrove has been working on three primary SoCs \u2013 Secure IoT, Vision SoC and Edge Compute. While all of them are in the design phase, Secure IoT will enter production by late 2023 at fabs in the US and Taiwan. These chips are powered by IIT Madras\u2019 SHAKTI, an open-source initiative by the RISE Group, to develop state-of-the-art SoCs in India. Mindgrove also benefits from the Indian government\u2019s push for self-sufficiency in chip design and manufacturing. The startup claims its SoCs have several use cases across categories and segments, including IoT, edge computing, EVs, smart utility meters, and security equipment such as fingerprint locks and CCTVs. According to an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) research  report , the Indian population is facing a severe mental health crisis, with depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorders constituting one-sixth of all health-related disorders. Another  research  by the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) finds that nearly 150 Mn Indians require mental health care services but fewer than 30 Mn are seeking care. Having witnessed this problem firsthand, Bani Singh and Drishti Gupta founded Now&Me, an AI-enabled startup focused on self-care for Gen Z.\u00a0 Their flagship product is an expert chat panel, which helps users connect with mental health and self-improvement experts via text, calls, or video calls. Unlike traditional therapy sessions, the platform caters to individual needs, allowing flexible session durations at as low as INR 7 per minute. The expert panel, which comprises professionals fluent in multiple languages, offers both therapy and coaching.\u00a0 Additionally, the startup provides a peer support community, enabling users to connect with like-minded individuals and express their feelings. The peer support community provides a safe space for users to share their stories openly, combating feelings of isolation. Now&Me has adopted a freemium model, providing users with a free trial of therapy and expert services, followed by paid recurring sessions. The pay-per-minute approach allows users to pay for the duration of their sessions with experts.\u00a0 In the last three months, Now&Me has assisted over 7,000 individuals. The startup now aims to expand its reach beyond individuals and provide enterprise-level support. The plan by 2024 is to offer an expert chat panel for both B2C and B2B needs, enabling more individuals and organisations to access the necessary guidance and support. India has a 100% electrification target to decarbonise its transportation by 2030, and the homegrown EV market is likely to become a $206 Bn opportunity by that time, according to a CEEW-Centre for Energy Finance report. But the country will require investments worth $180 Bn+ to reach its green mobility goals. Despite the sector\u2019s rapid growth and great potential, financing for EV startups has been sluggish at home. Nikhil Nair, who earlier worked with SELCO and M-COPA for solar financing in India and Nigeria, was aware of how a capital crunch can affect the mass transition to EVs. So, the cleantech veteran launched Ohm Mobility in 2020, an EV financing platform connecting startups with FIs. The Bengaluru-based EV fintech collaborates with multiple FIs, including banks, NBFCs and EV leasing companies, to ensure hassle-free lending and speedy disbursals. It claims to have disbursed loans worth INR 35 Cr in the past three months and charges a platform fee from the EV startups. Short term, Ohm Mobility aims to help finance 30% of Indian EV companies by 2024. While buying products, especially electronic items, vehicles and consumer durables, is fun, they can become a headache over time, especially when they start to wear out, demanding servicing. Getting after-sales service of any kind, be it appliances or vehicles, is a long process and demands maintaining a long list of contacts. Further, customers often face long wait times, while companies incur high costs in just registering requests. Understanding that the country\u2019s after-sales services sector required a disruption when it comes to offering better customer experience, Nitin Chawla, a former IBM employee, founded OneDios in 2019, along with a fellow IBMer, Amit Sharma. The startup runs a mobile app, OneDios, which allows users to search and register a service request within 60 seconds. Its flagship product, the OneDios Request Booking System (ORBS), works as a gateway to connect customers with brands. Customers can also upload their invoices and warranty cards to tag their products in the app to schedule after-sales services and register requests faster. The solution can be integrated with any CRM, enabling brands to deploy ORBS within two weeks. OneDios has partnered with 90-plus major brands, including Daikin, Hitachi and Voltas. Partnerships with brands and dealerships not only allow the startup to sell extended warranties and register service requests but also acquire customers at the point of sale. The primary revenue stream for OneDios is the commissions that it earns from service requests raised via its app. It also makes money by working with brands to sell extended warranties. OneDios estimates that at least 1.6 Bn service requests are routed through call centres across India per year, giving it a large TAM. This TAM has allowed OneDios to register more than 800K users and 60K service requests per month. The startup\u2019s revenue during FY23 was INR 1.35 Cr, up 20X from FY22. In FY24, OneDios aims to sell 50K extended warranties, deliver 10 Lakh service requests and onboard 500K new customers, with hopes to become profitable by FY26. While there are numerous brands in India claiming to offer \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018green\u2019 products, determining the authenticity of these claims can be challenging. Additionally, many brands that offer genuine products often fail to grab consumers\u2019 attention as they primarily sell through their websites. Seeking to adopt a more mindful lifestyle, when they became parents for the second time, Abhijit Bhattacharya and Neha Gahlaut faced similar difficulties. They realised that finding genuine products, which are no green sheen, from various websites and platforms was quite a challenge. This led Bhattacharya and Gahlaut to found OneGreen, a one-stop shop for all green and mindful products, in 2020. The platform offers products across categories such as baby care, food and beverages, home and dining, clothing, fashion and pet supplies, among others. In just three years, OneGreen has grown to become a horizontal ecommerce platform that offers over 20,000 products from 500-plus brands across more than 85 categories. OneGreen has developed a three-step quality and credibility measurement model, OneGreen Index, to mitigate green-washing in the market. The algorithm validates and confirms claims made by a brand and testifies its presence and popularity, rating it on a scale of 1 to 10 \u2014 the higher the score, the better the product.\u00a0 OneGreen operates on a commission-based revenue model. The startup has managed to reduce its burn rate by 90% in the past six months and grow its GMV by 10% MoM. The startup also claims to have a 20% repeat rate over 90 days. By 2024, OneGreen plans to cut down its costs even further, increase repeat customers and improve average order value. According to an IBEF  report , India recorded $50.2 Bn in total agriculture exports during 2021-22, up 20% from $41.3 Bn in 2020-21. However, cross-border trade of food products faces several challenges, including complex ecosystems and middlemen, limited access for SME buyers and a lack of price transparency. Having faced these challenges while working in the international sourcing division at Flipkart, Bipul Kumar founded ONWO in 2022 to ease the cross-border trading of food products. ONWO is an exporter of rice and sugar. The startup\u2019s curated platform offers overseas SME buyers a range of products from Indian producers, including multiple variants of rice as well as processed and raw sugar. The platform simplifies the procurement process by offering quality-assured, low-touch pre and post-order experiences. ONWO provides its services across both online and offline channels, allowing customers to reach the platform via all avenues. The platform also provides contract manufacturing and private label solutions, quality assurance and risk management and complete order fulfilment. ONWO has 15-plus partner mills located primarily in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana. So far, the startup claims to have delivered more than 10,000 metric tonnes worth of produce to regions such as North America and the Middle East. ONWO generates revenue through multiple streams. It charges a commission on the price of the products sold on its platform. Additionally, it earns fees for fulfilment services and value-added services provided to manufacturers and buyers. Recently, the startup claimed to have achieved a 90% repeat order rate, turning EBITDA positive in the process. ONWO also claims to have $10 Mn in ARR in FY23 and plans to hit $1 Bn in revenue by 2026. Keeping the four-legged, furry companions squeaky clean can be tricky. But more worrisome are the ingredients used in off-the-shelf grooming products that can be extremely harmful if licked or swallowed by dogs and cats. The market needed a Mamaearth for pet care \u2013 brimming with the goodness of natural products \u2013 and Mumbai-based Papa Pawsome has created that niche.\u00a0 Nishita and Nikita Agarwal (unrelated), the digital-first D2C pet grooming brand offers a wide range of holistic wellness products which use plant extracts instead of harmful chemicals like sulphates, parabens, silicones and artificial fragrances. These include wet and dry shampoos, detanglers, itch creams and medicinal ointments for ticks, fleas and infections, paw and skin creams, spa kits and more. Pet parents can also choose products from dog breeds. Papa Pawsome sells through its dedicated website, quick commerce platforms like Blinkit and Zepto, and marketplaces such as Amazon, Flipkart and BigBasket. It claims a user base of 20K+, a 60% rise in repeat customers and an ARR of INR 4 Cr in FY23, including month-on-month revenue growth of 20%. The D2C brand plans to launch new products, including dog toothpaste, hemp oil and pet wipes in the short term. Elderly poverty in India can be quite alarming in the next decade or two. As per the National Statistical Office, the country\u2019s aged population will reach 194 Mn in 2031 from 138 Mn in 2021. And more than 90 Mn of them will not have financial security, according to a 2021 report by the Agewell Foundation. Although the Vision India@2047 document considers (post-retirement) gainful engagement for the active and healthy, brothers Kuldeep and Shivam Parashar wanted to do more. They were alarmed by the inadequacy of the US retirement system when they worked there and planned for their parents\u2019 golden years. The viability of the Indian pension system is also under the scanner. For instance, a 2022 report by  The Print  estimated that around 300 Mn would be without pension benefits by 2050. So, the Parashars launched the PensionBox app in 2021 to help people plan their retirement. The Bengaluru-based fintech uses AI solutions to generate pension plans based on the contributions made to the National Pension Scheme (NPS). It further takes into consideration a person\u2019s age, salary/monthly income, desired retirement age and place and whether they have a business plan for post-retirement years. The platform allows complete control over contribution schedules so that users can put the money in at their convenience. In case there is no NPS contribution during the one-year period the user has for matching their contribution target, the app adjusts the goal within the selected retirement age accordingly.  It has also come up with a B2B2C vertical, partnering with private-sector companies to ensure pension benefits for their workforce. It has teamed up with five such companies so far.  PensionBox claims to have onboarded more than 1.5 Lakh users, tracking INR 250 Cr in pension savings. The platform takes a 0.5% cut on every NPS investment as recurring revenue. In other words, PensionBox charges a small percentage on each transaction happening on its platform. It also charges users a one-time fee for opening an account with the NPS.  PensionBox aims to onboard 2 Mn users and 100 B2B clients by 2024. It plans to bring in 10 Mn users and 2K companies by 2026 and wants to emerge as the country\u2019s first pension tech unicorn. It will also apply to patent its AI-powered dynamic pension planning engine. Despite waves of technological advancements, a majority of Indian enterprises are still operating on low PF circuits, which results in a lot of electricity wastage.\u00a0 For the uninitiated, the PF or power factor expresses the ratio of actual power used in a circuit to the apparent power delivered.\u00a0 Another challenge for Indian enterprises is that the ones that pay more than INR 50,000 in electricity bills are charged differently. This is because authorities believe that they induce disturbances in power lines.\u00a0 These were two of the major headwinds that Anand Teke faced during his previous stint as the founder of a rooftop solar startup, HelioKraft.\u00a0  To address this, Teke joined hands with Hemant Shinde and founded Powerbot in 2020 to arrest runaway costs by improving efficiency.  The startup examines the electricity data of enterprises through its proprietary smart analyser, which is designed to analyse power quality on 100-plus parameters.\u00a0 Next, the analyser, installed at the premises of users, sends the data to Powerbot\u2019s cloud. The data is then analysed by Powerbot\u2019s proprietary algorithms to design filters aligned to the client\u2019s power needs, which are then installed at their respective properties.\u00a0 The smart meters and power filters are the primary revenue generators for Powerbot, which operates on a B2B business model. With 50-plus clients onboard, the startup claims to be on the course to generate 8X more revenues this year compared to last year. The founders have plans to expand to 15-plus states by next year. It recently also struck a distribution deal with a well-known Indian brand. Every customer-facing company, especially B2C companies, have several promotions and loyalty programs in place to drive customer retention and improve sales metrics. However, this process is complex, expensive, time-consuming, and disrupts internal workflows. To resolve this complex web of problems, Akhil Suhag, Akshay Suhag, Mukul Anand and Tushar Dhara founded Rehook.ai in 2023. The startup offers a full-stack platform that automates the entire user promotion stack and saves time, money and resources required to build promotional strategies and loyalty programmes, including coupons, bonuses, leaderboards, action-based rewards, referrals, streaks, gift cards and more. It has developed an in-house rule engine, which enables companies to create rules and tailor promotional campaigns based on user actions. This approach also allows for high-impact and personalised campaigns that can be optimised and targeted for maximum impact. One of Rehook.ai\u2019s unique selling propositions is its platform-independent, API-first, and event-driven architecture, which ensures scalability and eliminates any tech dependency post-integration. This allows brands to build hyper-personalised promotions at scale while having complete control. Clients can edit, pause or modify any campaign at any time and set conditions for budget, time frame, reward validity, and recurrence. Rehook.ai operates on a SaaS subscription and pay-as-you-go revenue model. Having onboarded its first 10 customers, the startup aims to achieve $1 Mn in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) by 2024 and targets $5 Mn ARR by 2026. The used car market is known for its complexity and fragmentation, leading dealers to invest significant time and resources in sourcing, grading, and pricing pre-owned vehicles. While various startups, such as Cars24, CarDekho, Droom, and Spinny, have entered the segment, persistent challenges remain. One notable newcomer is SheerDrive, a digital platform cofounded in 2020 by Siddharth Panikar and Ravisen Mehra. The primary goal of SheerDrive is to assist both new and used car dealers in efficiently procuring and remarketing used vehicles. The platform boasts a range of AI and ML-enabled features designed to streamline the car evaluation and pricing process. Among these is the Vehicle Scan tool, which utilises AI and ML algorithms to analyse a vehicle\u2019s condition based on a photograph, identifying any potential damage or issues. Another noteworthy feature is Intelligent Computation, a web dashboard that allows dealers to review and grade various vehicle parts, thereby gaining valuable insights into the car\u2019s overall condition. Armed with this information, dealers can proactively address any damages or necessary repairs before putting the car up for sale. Assured Pricing is yet another critical component of SheerDrive, offering an algorithm that generates fair market values for used cars. By considering factors such as the vehicle\u2019s condition, mileage, and location, the algorithm provides dealers with an accurate and guaranteed fair market value for each car. Lastly, the Robust Remarketing platform serves as a valuable intermediary between car retailers and web aggregators. By connecting used cars with potential buyers, this platform also offers insights into the optimal timing and location for marketing a particular used car. SheerDrive operates on a subscription-based revenue model, with dealers paying a monthly fee to access the platform\u2019s robust features. The fee structure is determined based on the number of vehicles each dealer sells, ensuring a fair and scalable pricing system. Marketplaces are one of the most popular ecommerce formats nowadays. But traditional platforms still struggle with vendor onboarding, inventory cataloguing, order processing and fulfilment, resulting in longer processing times and hindered growth. Sharad Kabra, a second-time entrepreneur, faced similar issues when he built myBageecha, a multi-vendor online marketplace offering garden products.\u00a0 To make life easy for online sellers from every nook and cranny, Kabra set up Shipturtle in 2021. The ecommerce SaaS suite can transform any run-of-the-mill marketplace into an asset-light digital bazaar where shoppers can search through a huge catalogue or directory of brands, and businesses can sell their offerings to a much larger user base. Its plugin can be easily integrated with the store formats of Shopify (WooCommerce and Magento frameworks are also getting developed) for vendor syncing, cataloguing, order automation, fulfilment, tracking, commission generation and reconciliation. The Ahmedabad-based startup recently launched a host of website and app-building tools to create vertical markets and extend digital commerce scope beyond Amazon and Flipkart. It has also partnered with logistics players, such as Shiprocket, Amazon Shipping and Delhivery, to provide various delivery options. The ecommerce enabler has multiple revenue streams in place, including subscription fees for its website and app-building toolkits, customisation fees and a one-time logistics carrier integration charge. It has onboarded 30 B2B clients so far. By 2024, Shipturtle will build a directory for D2C brands to help them cross-sell to similar companies without third-party intervention, with plans to hit $1 Mn ARR by 2025. It also plans to roll out a social commerce arm by 2026, where content creators will boost brand credibility and drive their sales. When a request is made to an API, it can take a few seconds to fetch responses. This can be a problem when developing a web or mobile app that needs to make frequent API requests. As such, slow and unreliable APIs can cause poor user experience, increased bounce rate and loss of revenue. Often, using a caching solution is the only way out, which helps store the responses from APIs for faster response rates. Integrating the best of both worlds, Aditya Agrawal and Adithya Kavuluru founded SuperAPI in 2022, making APIs instantly cacheable with their solution. Under the hood, SuperAPI does everything an app developer does to make APIs cacheable. The startup offers HTTP caching, in-memory caching, database caching and stale-while-revalidate caching. SuperAPI also offers API monitoring, validation and compression, allowing data transfer to remain manageable within a limited bandwidth and keep API data up-to-date. These features ensure a better user experience with improved responsiveness and reliability. Since the startup does everything in one place, it helps save a lot of money, which developers would have spent buying solutions to make their APIs cacheable. SuperAPI is free to use for up to 100 requests per month and hits a subscription paywall after that. The subscription fee starts at $10 per month for 1,000 requests and goes up to $100 per month for 1,00,000 requests. Between June 2022 and June 2023, India registered nearly 8.27 Lakh two-wheeler electric vehicles (EVs),  according to data from the government\u2019s Vahan portal . Despite this, the price of a two-wheeler EV could burn a hole in the pockets of a large chunk of the Indian population, which can lead to stagnation in EV demand. Having worked in the vehicle leasing department of Jaguar Land Rover, Sameer Arif came up with the idea of launching a similar product for EVs, which led to the inception of Swytched in 2021, which offers two-wheeler EVs on a monthly subscription. Like popular subscription models, the startup provides customers with a complete package, covering everything from vehicle to servicing. Customers can choose from Swytched\u2019s diverse range of brands such as Ather, Ola and Revolt. Once subscribed, the startup takes care of all the necessary support and services. At the end of each month, customers can decide whether to renew the vehicle subscription, switch to another model, or discontinue the service. Swytched\u2019s pricing structure accounts for the vehicle, insurance, servicing, breakdown support and charging refunds. Over the past three months, Swytched has gained more than 300 active monthly subscribers. Swytched\u2019s short-term plan for 2024 is to double its fleet size. By 2026, the startup aims to expand its operations beyond Bengaluru and establish a presence in multiple geographies with a fleet of over 2,000 vehicles on the road. India has become the world\u2019s SaaS hub, with companies like Zoho and Freshworks building for the world. However, almost all B2B software companies face challenges with pricing and billing in their operational workflows. SaaS products are typically billed as per usage, along with other billing models such as subscriptions. However, managing large-scale data in real-time for usage-based pricing can be challenging. Similarly, offering tailored pricing strategies can also be a roadblock, when businesses rely on traditional subscription billing platforms that may not provide the flexibility required. To uncomplicate complex billing processes in the enterprisetech space, Abhishek Rajagopal, Aravind Sriraman and Tholkappiyan Velavan founded Togai in 2022. Togai\u2019s flagship product is a billing platform that focuses on addressing the limitations of traditional subscription billing platforms. The platform excels in handling metered billing, allowing businesses to price their products based on customer usage, though it also offers SaaS companies to design subscription models, be it usage-based, subscription or hybrid pricing. Togai\u2019s event-based architecture enables SaaS companies to create and adjust pricing models quickly, catering to the specific needs of their customers. The platform also integrates with existing tools such as CPQ, CRM, billing systems, usage analytics and revenue recognition, ensuring smooth and efficient pricing updates across all systems. Enterprises can avail of Togai\u2019s solution for free, up to the first $50K in billing per month. After a company crosses the free limit threshold, it can choose from either its growth plan (with 100/1,000 invoices worth $25K/$250K) or its custom-made enterprise plan. According to a 2019 McKinsey  report , global transaction banking pulls generate nearly $1 Tn in annual revenue across segments such as trade finance, cash management and working capital products, including overdrafts and deposits. However, much of this work happens manually, which slows down the entire value chain. Having worked in the banking sector, Vaibhav Tambe, Lavin Kotian, Pulak Jain and Sachin Gupta witnessed the tech and functionality challenges in setting up transaction banking infrastructure. As such, the quartet built TransBnk, a plug-and-play solution which digitises the escrow process for banks, NBFCs and other companies that engage in lending and supply-chain financing. The startup has digitised the onboarding process and the post-onboarding transactions via its TrustHub platform, reducing the time it takes to onboard users to an escrow account from 45 days to hours. Further, it also offers banks pre-onboarded anchors (companies offering lending solutions via banks) via the DEBS platform, simplifying the escrow journey. TransBnk also offers a plug-and-play co-lending solution for banks and startups looking to set up lending operations. The startup\u2019s APIs provide access to multiple banks and manage the entire process, from escrow opening to transaction management. The startup has also developed a tech stack to handle recurring payments. The startup monetises its tech stack by taking a small percentage of the value of transactions that happen via its platforms. In the short term, TransBnk is looking to expand its tech and product teams and product line to triple its clientele by 2024. India is rich in arts and crafts, weaves, colours and designs. And the creative minds from every niche bring forth their offerings through multiple home d\u00e9cor platforms. But these are either too expensive or the affordable ones often lack the quality. Also, most of these premium products are exported directly and similar products are unavailable in the domestic market to retain \u2018product exclusivity\u2019.\u00a0 When setting up a new home shortly after their marriage, Varun Vohra and Garima Luthra also started searching for exquisite home d\u00e9cor at pocket-friendly pricing. Although digital commerce has effectively done away with all borders, creative or otherwise, they were unable to find their choice of products, and the prices were not to their liking. Eventually, the duo, along with Garima\u2019s cousin Pranav Arora, launched a B2C curated marketplace, Vaaree, in 2022 to cater to the connoisseurs at home. The Bengaluru-based ecommerce startup has developed a curated marketplace and operates on a manufacturer-to-consumer business model where quality remains the soul of creation. Before onboarding, manufacturers have to undergo a 32-step quality control checklist put together by Vaaree to assess quality and process control. Surprise monthly checks are also carried out at production units for maintaining and improving quality standards. The platform has tied up with 100 Indian manufacturers and has listed 20K+ SKUs across 75 categories, including bedding, furnishings, kitchen, dining, d\u00e9cor, bath and garden. Additionally, its team of experts offers personalised curation services for free to cater to shoppers\u2019 requirements. Vaaree\u2019s platform has an \u2018Inspiration\u2019 section, where users can talk with the startup\u2019s team to select designs and colours best suited to their tastes and budget. The marketplace earns commissions from manufacturers on products delivered. Vaaree claims 40% month-on-month growth in GMV and says it shipped more than 50K products in the first year. According to a  report  by the Association of Mutual Funds in India, the average assets under management for the Indian mutual fund industry for June 2023 stood at INR 44.82 Lakh Cr. Most of this value is locked away in long-term investments, and redeeming mutual funds means closing the account and losing returns. To address the emergency demands of customers and their unwillingness to withdraw from mutual funds, Bharat Lamba, Lalit Bihani, and Ankit Agrawal launched Volt Money in 2022, offering secured loans against mutual funds. Customers can avail loans from INR 25,000 to INR 2 Cr, depending on the size of their mutual funds. The fintech startup\u2019s interest rate starts at 9.95%, much lower than personal loans. With flexible lending terms compared to the rest of the industry, Volt claimed it is yet to see a default. The startup earns revenue by charging a commission from the interest paid by the borrower and through direct processing fees. Since Volt operates in the B2B2C business model, Lamba claims it has nearly zero customer acquisition cost (CAC). The startup is working on expanding its loan book and hiring resources to improve its tech stack. However, the long-term vision for Volt Money remains to diversify beyond mutual funds and leverage all financial assets for secured lending. [Edited by Shishir Parashar and Sanghamitra Mandal.

        "Article Content": "The year so far has thrown many challenges at Indian startups, yet founders have emerged more powerful than ever in the face of adversities. Well, speaking about adversities, the startup funding has regressed to 2020 levels.  The $8.3 Bn raised in 2023 so far  is nearly one-fourth of what the Indian startup ecosystem had raised during the same period in 2021. From a macro lens, things may look quite challenging for Indian startups and new-age sectors, however, a closer glance would unravel the dark horses of the Indian startup realm.\u00a0 One such example is the Indian SaaS market, which is scaling quite impressively and is projected to become a $50 Bn market opportunity by 2030, quadrupling its current size. Notably, Indian SaaS startups have raised more than $899 Mn so far this year.\u00a0 Not only this, even though the funding winter engulfed most of 2023, the month of October infused some hope, as Indian startups raised $1.1 Bn during the month, up from $846 Mn raised in the corresponding month last year.\u00a0 While this was hardly any respite for Indian startups, who continue to see a funding famine, we decided to stick to our tradition of bringing some of the most past-breaking startups to the fore every month. In this edition of \u201830 Startups To Watch\u2019, we have endeavoured to shine the spotlight on SaaS startups, accounting for the maximum number of startups in the list, followed by AI, edtech and fintech startups. Amid the current scheme of things, we yet again raise a toast to Indian founders for their resilience as we bring you the 41st edition of \u201830 Startups To Watch\u2019. Editor\u2019s Note: The list below is not a ranking of any kind. We have listed the startups alphabetically. In today\u2019s tech-driven world, data analysts and software developers are in high demand. This is because businesses have increased their reliance on data-driven strategies and software-powered solutions. These fields offer promising career prospects, luring a significant number of undergraduates to seek and cultivate the requisite skills. Based in Gurugram,  AccioJob  has positioned itself to cater to this burgeoning market by providing structured online learning programmes, which are tailored to help recent college graduates launch their careers in software development and data analytics. At the heart of its offerings are comprehensive, live training courses in areas like Java full-stack development, MERN full-stack development, and data analytics. Established in 2018 by Yashwardhan Burad, Priyanshu Agarwal, Vishu Bansal, and Harsh Sharma, AccioJob has plans to include high-demand domains such as DevOps, Testing, and Data Science by 2024. AccioJob\u2019s vision for the future includes exploring opportunities in formal education. This entails potential collaborations with colleges to integrate their programmes into undergraduate and postgraduate degree curricula. Additionally, AccioJob is considering establishing its proprietary degree offerings, either in partnership with institutions or with its physical infrastructure. In a bid to help fellow photographers ease their workloads and deliver images to their clients faster and with greater efficiency, Anand Rathi, Canon India ambassador, founded  Algomage  in 2021. The startup, which also made an appearance on Shark Tank India, has three flagship products \u2013 AlgoCull, AlgoEdit and AlgoShare. AlgoCull automates the culling and rating of thousands of images within an hour, based on user-defined parameters. AlgoEdit, on the other hand, uses AI to edit images in Lightroom, learning a photographer\u2019s style and preferences over time as it receives user input. AlgoShare employs facial recognition to ensure that all event attendees receive their images. The startup monetises its products through a freemium subscription model, allowing photographers to subscribe to any of Algomage\u2019s three apps on a monthly or annual basis. Algomage also offers a free plan with limited features. While there is a growing number of Indians who are making investments across a wide variety of assets, alternative assets like private credit, agronomy, real estate and private equity remain one of the most attractive classes of assets. While they promise high returns, only a few have the acumen to invest in such assets. The gap in knowledge and the absence of a platform to help users invest in such assets prompted Krisha Maggo to build  Altitude , a fixed-income platform enabling investments in alternative assets. The startup is set to soon launch its first investment opportunity, Prism Fund, on the National Stock Exchange. The fund is a multi-asset structured investment opportunity designed as a diversified basket of 10+ modern assets, including real estate, private credit, litigation, inventory and revenue-based finance, structured notes, and private equity, among others. Altitude is also in the middle of establishing thematic investment schemes within the alternative asset category. While Altitude has yet to receive SEBI\u2019s approval for the Prism Fund, it claims to have 35K+ investors waiting for the fund launch. It is looking to reach INR 100 Cr ($12 Mn) in assets under management (AUM) by November 2023, with an eye on scaling the number to $30 Mn (INR 250 Cr) AUM by December 2024. Effective solutions for risk and audit programs have often proven elusive for many companies. Legacy options tend to complicate processes, while other established players often offer one-size-fits-all solutions that fail to address specific challenges. AuditCue  aims to disrupt this paradigm by delivering tailor-made solutions that boost process resiliency and agility for its clients. Founded in 2022 by entrepreneurs Gaurav Kulkarni and Naren Janakiraman, AuditCue wants to redefine the audit experience for both auditors and auditees. What sets this Chennai-based startup apart is its flexible and modular platform. AuditCue understands that each organisation has unique challenges and needs, and it is committed to tailoring its services to meet those specific requirements. AuditCue\u2019s SaaS solution not only streamlines audit lifecycles but also enhances process resiliency and agility. It accelerates audit cycles, allowing organisations to stay ahead of the ever-evolving risk landscape. Amid the rapid growth of edtech platforms in India over the past five years, Switzerland and Bengaluru-based  Avidii , which is now expanding in the Indian market, distinguishes itself through its unique approach. Avidii offers immediate, personalised, and commitment-free educational services, catering to individual preferences and needs, setting it apart from the crowd of other edtech platforms. Founded in 2021 by Deepak Subbarao, Avidii claims to have onboarded over 400 expert tutors across India and has garnered more than 5,000 downloads within a short period. Avidii, which is active in four countries, has plans to reach 1 Mn users and downloads in India by the end of the year. Avidii\u2019s core offering is a 24\u00d77 on-demand learning service, providing customised support in subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, commerce, and arts, primarily aimed at students aged between 11 and 18. The platform operates with two primary business models. While its B2B segment focusses on partnerships with educational institutions to enhance the learning experience within schools and colleges, the startup\u2019s B2C segment enables direct one-on-one interactions between students and tutors, creating a personalised deep-learning experience. In a country like India, where pet ownership is on the rise, the pet care industry plays a pivotal role. The significance of this industry extends beyond convenience; it underscores the bond between humans and their pets. The growing awareness of pet care reflects an evolving society that values its four-legged members as family.  BellyRubs  understands this shift and stands at the forefront, offering a curated selection of high-quality products sourced from around the world. BellyRubs, an online pet supply store founded by Shirin Lamba and Ridhi Verma, is a one-stop shop for all your pet-related needs. The startup boasts an extensive array of products, spanning grooming essentials, premium food, engaging toys, and fashionable clothing for dogs. At BellyRubs, the focus is clear: happy owners, happy pets, and a happier world. It is not just about pet products; it is about improving the lives of beloved animals, ensuring they receive the best care possible. With the growing environmental concerns, businesses are increasingly acknowledging the need to minimise their environmental impact and maximise social contributions. However, challenges such as limited capital, small-scale production, and building brand credibility persist in the ever-expanding eco-conscious market, hindering the growth of sustainable businesses. Established in 2019 by Chaitsi Ahuja,  Brown Living  aims to bridge this gap by making sustainability a mainstream choice through the doorstep delivery of eco-friendly everyday-use products via its ecommerce platform. The company follows a drop-ship model to ensure plastic-free deliveries and support remote businesses. The ecommerce startup hosts over 500 brands on its platform, offering more than 65,000 SKUs across various sectors, including fashion, home decor, lifestyle, food, and kitchen essentials. Using its proprietary curation method, The Brown Lens, the company claims to have physically assessed over 1,200 businesses. Beyond being an ecommerce platform, Brown Living provides knowledge and education to support a sustainable lifestyle through its media service content. According to the company, 78% of its GMV comes from its online platform, followed by B2B orders and offline sales. Incorporated in September 2021, Bangalore-based  ClearFeed  is a conversational support platform designed to improve customer service and streamline internal communication for enterprises. Cofounded by Ankit Jain, Joydeep Sen Sarma, and Lalit Indoria, the startup leverages the power of AI and deep integration with popular tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams to revolutionise how businesses handle customer and employee requests. As remote work has become the norm, communication platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams have become integral to business operations. ClearFeed recognises the growing need for efficient conversational support tools to bridge the gaps across various departments. The startup uses AI models to track and escalate inquiries and requests. This allows different departments to interact seamlessly, enabling service teams to manage high query volumes and provide quick responses. ClearFeed has introduced innovative features such as triage channels, one-click ticket filing, and live two-way syncing of data. The startup\u2019s platform also integrates OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, which indexes product documentation, knowledge bases and wikis. This system can automatically generate answers in response to user queries, assisting agents in resolving user issues. With a strong focus on product development, ClearFeed has experienced exponential growth since its launch. The platform is now used by over 100 organisations globally, including industry leaders like Atlan Data, Last9, Sprinto, and Plum Insurance. India\u2019s professional skincare market has experienced significant growth, driven by an increasing awareness of the benefits of skincare. While this market initially focused on women, it now attracts a growing number of men who recognise the significance of maintaining healthy skin and addressing skin and hair-related concerns. Founded in 2021 by Arjun Soin,  Clinikally  is a healthtech startup that addresses the scarcity of dermatologists in India by offering a comprehensive and convenient telehealth platform. The company connects consumers with licenced dermatology practitioners, who create personalised treatment plans for various skin conditions. In addition to its core services, Clinikally has expanded into pharma distribution with private-label products under the Clinikally brand for aesthetic conditions and the Soteri Skin brand for chronic skin conditions. The platform offers dermatologist consultations at an affordable rate of INR 199 and presents innovative skincare products to its customers. Clinikally\u2019s short-term objectives revolve around strengthening its telehealth services, broadening its nutrition and nutraceutical offerings, and increasing the number of private-label partnerships from 175 to 500+ doctor clinics. Looking ahead to 2026, the company aspires to become a comprehensive platform for dermatology and nutrition care, featuring telehealth services, an online pharmacy, premium consumer brands, a nationwide network of dermatology specialists, and offline clinic partnerships. In an era of automation, speech AI has a crucial role to play in improving user experiences and aiding data-driven decision-making. Founded in December 2020 by Prateek Mehta and Vijay Krishna BS,  Contiinex  is looking to target the English-speaking global speech market. With its proprietary speech-to-text engine and the Contiinex Open Framework for Insights (COFI), driven by Language Model (LLM) technology, the company has already made progress in the healthcare and insurance sectors. The startup is focussed on transforming customer experience, enhancing business productivity, and optimising costs for companies in India, the US, and Australia. Contiinex\u2019s Speech AI platform can analyse voice files and empower businesses to understand their customers better and make strategic business decisions. The Bengaluru-based startup is also looking at expanding its Gen AI product offerings to address the space of unstructured data across all mediums like voice, chat, email, videos and visuals. With its in-house LLM capabilities, Contiinex wants to expand its horizons to other verticals like banking, retail and utilities. In recent years, India has witnessed numerous instances of debt recovery gone awry, leaving both lenders and borrowers in distress. The use of unscrupulous tactics by collection agencies employed by banks and NBFCs has exacerbated the situation, sometimes pushing borrowers to take extreme measures. Recognising that the tech-enabled intervention in this domain has been limited, Ananth Shroff and Ranjith Ramachandra founded  DPDzero , an AI-powered collections and debt recovery platform, in 2020. The startup serves both secured and unsecured products while maximising collection efficiency, especially for unsecured lending products. In recent months, DPDzero has forged partnerships with major NBFCs, including Tata Capital, KreditBee, Cashe, LazyPay and Snapmint, witnessing an impressive 7X growth in revenue within the past ten months. The startup generates revenue by earning a share of collections. In the short term, DPDzero aims to assemble a high-calibre team, bolster information security measures, and optimise its processes. By 2026, the company plans to invest in advanced AI models to introduce hyper-personalisation, expedite default prediction, and implement advanced borrower negotiation models. The state of child labour in the fashion industry is appalling at best. According to a report, nearly 60% of the workers in Indian mills were under 18 when they were first hired. Dressfolk , founded in 2017 by Nitin Mehrotra, specialises in creating traditional Indian dresses from across the country. The startup has partnered with 720+ artisans to empower the local weavers\u2019 community, focussing on sourcing its products responsibly and free of child labour at any stage of its supply chain. Dressfolk is also focussed on building collaborative relationships with artisans to understand craft regions and traditions. The startup sells its products across categories such as sarees, blouses, fabrics, dupattas and suit sets via its website and several offline multi-brand and online marketplaces in the premium price category. Dressfolk claims to have a user base in 20 countries and boasts that it has increased the income of its partner artisans by more than 150%. Founded by Keshav Reddy and Rajeev Ranjan in 2022,  Equal  is a pioneering startup that envisions a world where access to essential services and opportunities is based on merit, not identity. In a nation as diverse as India, where numerous individuals are denied access to credit, housing, benefits, and products due to various factors, Equal seeks to level the playing field for over a billion Indians. At the heart of their mission is the Equal ID Gateway, a product that empowers businesses to establish seamless and secure identity-sharing workflows for consumers. Much like a payment gateway facilitates financial transactions, the Equal ID Gateway facilitates the exchange of personal identification information when requested, all while maintaining privacy and security. It spans a wide array of use cases, from healthcare to education, employment, and travel, essentially anywhere a consumer needs to share their identity with a business. Equal\u2019s revenue is generated through a pay-per-verification model. It claims to have over 1 Mn consumers currently. D2C brands have gained substantial traction in recent years, but expanding beyond online channels has been challenging due to high costs. The primary issue is establishing efficient offline distribution networks. Fairdeal , founded by Prateek and Yash Bansal, aims to disrupt the retail distribution landscape in India with its innovative data-driven approach. The startup provides comprehensive offline distribution services to D2C brands, enabling them to tap into the vast potential of the Indian market. Fairdeal connects D2C brands with a network of over 10,000 retailers. Leveraging data, Fairdeal ensures optimal brand-to-retailer matching, resulting in faster and more substantial sales. Additionally, the company helps brands co-create new products and develop pricing strategies. This approach benefits not only emerging D2C brands but also established local brands seeking expansion into new territories. The user interface (UI) is a critical component of app and website design, serving as the initial point of interaction for users. However, many design teams struggle with a lack of inspiration, motivation, resources, or time, resulting in subpar UI and disappointing user experiences. Founded in 2023 by Chirag Singla and Moksh Garg,  Figr  aims to address these challenges with its AI-driven tools, including Lookr, Flash UI, and Prokit. Lookr provides users with a vast database of high-quality design work, helping them find design inspiration through a search-based method and recommendations for needed elements. Flash UI takes that inspiration and offers editable templates, enabling users to create customised apps or websites. Prokit provides design resources such as icons, fonts, and colour palettes, allowing users to develop a unique design language for their brand. Figr is also in the process of launching two new products, Identity and Construct, which will enable users to build a brand identity from scratch and visualise concepts in a UI format. The startup operates on a subscription-based model, monetising its platforms through monthly or annual subscriptions. According to a 2023 report, approximately 19% of India\u2019s adult population is grappling with chronic pain, often stemming from poor postural habits and a sedentary lifestyle. Additionally, India witnesses nearly 2 Lakh cases of spinal injuries every year, with the majority attributed to chronic bad posture and habits. In response to these pressing health concerns, Manjeet Singh, who successfully recovered from Lumbar Spondylitis in 2016-17, joined forces with his long-time friend and tech veteran, Amit Bhayani, to launch FlexifyMe in 2021. FlexifyMe  is an AI-powered platform designed to assist individuals in correcting their posture and alleviating chronic pain. Utilising advanced AI motion tracking, it can detect postural defects, muscle inflexibility, and musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). The startup claims its AI motion coach generates the world\u2019s first physical posture analysis report that identifies the root cause of chronic pain and creates a custom plan combining the latest physiotherapy postures with yoga and meditation. FlexifyMe offers personalised subscription plans, with an average cost of INR 16,000 for six months. Currently, FlexifyMe claims to have attracted 2,000 paying clients from India and 24 other countries. They have ambitious plans to expand their user base to over 10,000 by the end of 2024, establishing partnerships with over 200 doctors in the process. One of the biggest problems is that most LLMs are only available as cloud-based services, meaning enterprises need to share data with third parties to use LLMs. That is not a viable option for many enterprises due to privacy concerns or compliance requirements. Solving these problems is Bengaluru-based  Giga ML , set up by Varun Vummadi and Esha Manideep Dinne in 2023. The startup provides on-premise deployment, fine-tuning and privacy for LLMs. Its X1-Large model is currently the most powerful LLM available for on-premise deployment. Giga ML also offers an API compatible with OpenAI\u2019s API, so users can switch to the startup\u2019s API seamlessly without rewriting code. The startup targets enterprises that need to use LLMs for internal purposes but don\u2019t want to use cloud-based services or share their data with third parties. Giga ML\u2019s on-premise deployment option gives enterprises full control over their data and their LLMs. The startup also offers fine-tuning services for LLMs, so enterprises can train LLMs on their data to perform specific tasks. This allows enterprises to create LLMs that are tailored to their specific needs. Giga ML\u2019s privacy features are designed to protect the confidentiality of enterprise data. The startup does not use any data its customers upload to its platform. Giga ML monetises its product through a subscription model. Enterprises can pay a monthly fee to use Giga ML\u2019s platform to deploy, fine-tune, and use LLMs on their servers. India has witnessed a significant surge in the edtech sector, primarily focussed on K-12 education, test preparation, and upskilling in areas like data science and marketing. However,  Novatr , formerly known as Oneistox, stands out as an educational technology startup with a unique emphasis on transforming the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Founded in 2021 by a team of architects and engineers, including Harkunwar Singh, Vipanchi Handa, Mehul Kumar, and Chaithanya Murali, Novatr aims to bridge the gap between traditional AEC education and the rapidly evolving technological landscape, equipping learners to become future-ready professionals.

There is an emerging trend of millennials and Gen Z starting online businesses on social media. Recognising the potential and challenges, two IIT Bombay alumni Rahul Gope and Anjan Kumar Patel launched  Oyela  in 2021 to empower the creative entrepreneurship explosion in India by providing essential tools and opportunities through social media. Oyela assists emerging businesses, product creators, and artists in effectively selling their products and expanding their online presence.

Founded in early 2023 by IIT alumni Nav Agrawal and Swapnil Upadhyay, Bengaluru-based  Pep  aims to revolutionise the content creation landscape in the era of Gen AI. The rapid evolution of technology has made content creation more accessible, but it has also inundated the internet with a deluge of low-quality content. Pep addresses this challenge through a unique approach, emphasising curation, categorisation, and content credibility. Pep\u2019s mission is to establish a social-first online marketplace for content that empowers users to explore, purchase, and monetise a wide variety of content and services. The platform offers a one-stop destination, granting users access to live sessions, one-on-one consultations, and the ability to purchase various content formats, including PDFs, videos, and audio.

Running cafeterias without the use of technology often leads to operational inefficiencies such as manual order processing, inventory mismanagement, and a lack of transparency.

Platos aims to tackle issues such as high aggregator commissions, cafeteria management inefficiencies, and transparency gaps, ultimately enhancing the cafeteria experience for clients and food partners. With its commitment to seamless technology and professional food partnerships, Platos is set to reshape the corporate catering landscape. Casual gaming has gained immense importance in recent years, reflecting the changing dynamics of the gaming industry, which like many other sectors and industries has greatly benefited from the widespread availability of affordable mobile data. Even those with basic smartphones can easily access and contribute to the growing mobile gaming community through app stores. Founded by Ramakrishna Reddy Y L and Shubham Joshi in 2023,  QuriousBit , a gaming studio based in Bengaluru, is on a mission to revolutionise the mobile gaming industry by offering high-quality casual puzzle games. In a genre largely dominated by match3 and blast-themed games, QuriousBit seeks to introduce a fresh and personalised gaming experience. The founders bring a wealth of experience, having previously developed and managed games for PlaySimple Games, a global leader in word games that was acquired for over $500 Mn in 2021.

With the global mobile casual games market valued at around $18 Bn in 2023 and projected to reach $25 Bn by 2027, QuriousBit is well-positioned to tap into the growing casual gamers of the country. Founded in 2021 by Raj Sahu, Kiran and Ravish,  SYSOTEL.AI  is on a mission to revolutionise the hospitality industry through innovative technological solutions. At the heart of SYSOTEL.AI\u2019s product suite is a platform, Intelligent Booking Engine (IBE), that not only ensures secure online reservations but also simplifies the booking process for guests. This engine integrates with Google\u2019s extensive travel services, making it the preferred choice for hotels seeking to solidify their online presence.

It also provides invaluable insights into market dynamics, event planning, and reputation management. Today, a majority of Indians are worried about their financial well-being, and there are several reasons behind this. One such reason is that India, despite being a savings-first nation, saw its household savings hit a 47-year low in FY23, according to the RBI data. Amid the current scheme of things, many individuals get stuck in situations, be it poorly paying investment cycles or even investment scams, which only deteriorate their financial health further. Having been in this space for a long time, finfluencers Sharan Hegde and Raghav Gupta set up  The 1% Club  in 2022 to address the challenges budding investors face in their investment journey. The 1% Club is a members-only financial education platform that offers educational resources, mentorship, entrepreneurial opportunities and networking avenues to its members looking to achieve financial independence. The platform offers curated courses across personal finance and the stock market. Each module starts with the basics and then goes deeper. For instance, the personal finance segment goes from investments across different asset classes to insurance planning and, finally, tax planning. Similarly, the stock market module starts with the stakeholders and moves to IPOs, financial statements, annual reports and the psychological aspects of investing. The startup claims to be the first influencer-backed venture to delve into entrepreneurship. In the short term, The 1% Club is looking to get registered with the market regulator SEBI. India is fast becoming the world capital for lifestyle diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Despite this, a lack of motivation to pursue a healthier lifestyle continues to grip most individuals. Having sensed the underlying problem, Pratik Agarwal, Siddhesh Ghuge and Yash Thakur came together to launch  The Cube Club  in 2020. The Cube Club is an online marketplace from where users can buy fitness equipment and accessories such as dumbbells and weights, benches, pull-up bars, yoga mats, and more. In October 2023, the startup launched its fitness app, Dopamine, which allows users to embark on their fitness journey with friends from the comfort of their own homes. Users can create workout channels on the app, allowing them to track their progress and stay motivated. The Dopamine app uses AI-based tech to track a user\u2019s workout routine, which then can be shared with friends in a gamified manner. Currently, The Cube Club generates revenue by selling fitness equipment on its website, Amazon, and over 100 offline stores. Looking ahead, the startup plans to diversify its revenue streams by monetising Dopamine. At the end of January 2023, Indians held more than 11 Cr demat accounts, up from around 8 Cr accounts a year ago. The high number still translates to a mere 3% of India\u2019s total households actively investing in the stock market. The market\u2019s complexity and the lack of substantial returns have made it a daunting prospect for many. Recognising the challenges, Ayush Agarwal, Mihir Verma, Hemant Patil and Ajay Sharma, all avid stock market investors, seized the opportunity to create a platform that rewards investors for their consistent participation in the stock market. Thus,  Valo  was born in 2023. The startup has formed partnerships with numerous brands, including Domino\u2019s, Spotify, Netflix, Swiggy, Zomato, and others, to incentivise users for their stock market investments. Valo also offers a dedicated finance community where investors can engage, learn, and grow together in the personal finance domain. Additionally, it features a finance marketplace similar to the Google Play Store but for finance-only apps. The platform utilises broker API to access investment data, providing users with rewards and key metrics without the need for email or SMS access, thus safeguarding user privacy. Valo generates revenue through brand partnerships and commissions from trades, without imposing any charges on its users. Despite its recent launch in September 2023, the platform has already attracted over 1,000 users within a month. Valo\u2019s ambitious plans involve expanding its user base to 10,000+ by the end of 2024. Credit cards are rapidly gaining popularity in India. This has prompted many companies across segments to launch co-branded credit cards with major banks and networks. However, the process takes anywhere between 12 and 15 months and requires 10+ tech integrations across processes. With the NPCI and banks targeting 300 Mn credit cards in the next five to seven years, banking and technology veterans Gaurav Mittal, Abhinav Garg, Himanshu Agrawal and Puneet Sharma founded  Vegapay  in 2022. The startup offers a core Credit Card Management System (CCMS) for both the supply side (banks) and the demand side (co-brand partners). Vegapay enables hyper-configurable solutions for credit card offerings, alongside white-label dashboards for the issuers to create and manage programmes without any dependency on tech. Currently, Vegapay has established partnerships with a bank to oversee all aspects of credit card management and aims to onboard four banks by the end of the coming year. Vegapay has also recently introduced a multi-currency card in collaboration with two issuers and a co-branding partner. Vegapay\u2019s revenue model relies on a one-time fee and subsequent commission from minimum monthly billing done by the user banks. The startup is now working to expand to Middle East and North African regions and reach 15+ banking partners by the end of 2025. Founded by Karan Anand and Himanshu Uniyal in 2023,  Wootz.work  is a global sourcing platform specialising in custom engineering equipment and solutions.

Wootz.work emphasises value engineering, offering products optimised for easy installation and efficient shipping, with components chosen for end-market serviceability and compliance. The platform also provides virtual factory tours, comprehensive fulfilment dashboards, and round-the-clock after-sales support. Cybersecurity challenges persist as threats become increasingly sophisticated. Issues such as data breaches, ransomware attacks, and vulnerabilities in technology infrastructure remain prominent. Addressing these challenges demands robust defence strategies, threat intelligence, and innovative solutions. Founded in 2020 by Sanket Sarkar,  Zeron , the cyber risk posture management platform, is working on cybersecurity for enterprises. It offers a comprehensive suite of solutions, following an ABCD framework, to address various aspects of cyber risk management. These modules include attack surface automation, business posture assessment, compliance automation, defence automation, and a cloud monitor.

The company\u2019s presence extends globally, with its headquarters in Mumbai, India, and outreach in the ASEAN, MENA, the Americas, and the EU regions through strategic partnerships. In the short term, Zeron aims to onboard 50 customers and strengthen its presence in the MENA and ASEAN regions. In the long term, the company envisions creating an ecosystem for cybersecurity trust among organisations, simplifying their business journey. India had 2.79 Cr formalised jobs as of August 2023, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. However, this figure represents only about 5% of the 52.4 Cr Indians actively participating in the labour force. The vast unorganised sector is gradually recognising the potential of technology and its transformative capabilities. At the forefront of this transformative movement is  Zopnote , a B2B2C SaaS platform dedicated to local commerce. Founded in 2019 by Rajesh Badgeri and Chengappa Chottera, this innovative startup offers two distinctive apps \u2014 a merchant mobile app and a customer app. The former empowers small local businesses with features like customer engagement, automated billing, online collection, bookkeeping, and business intelligence. The latter enables end customers to discover and purchase products and services in their vicinity, track expenses, and make payments seamlessly. For instance, businesses can list their products and services on the platform, allowing users to explore and place orders directly from the app. Although currently operational only in Bengaluru, Zopnote has successfully garnered over 52,000 B2C customers across 1,000+ communities in the city, processing more than 2.3 Cr bills each month. The startup monetises its platform through a subscription fee that merchants pay to utilise its services. In the short term, Zopnote aims to achieve product-market fit (PMF), with long-term plans involving the creation of a decentralised model to leverage the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) and expand its reach across India.

        "Article Content": "What an eventful month it has been, the July of 2024! While the world\u2019s third-largest startup ecosystem breathed a sigh of relief following the demise of the angel tax, industry stakeholders have officially declared the end of the funding winter. According to\u00a0 Inc42\u2019s \u00a0\u201c India\u2019s Top Startup Investor Ranking H1 2024 Survey ,\u201d more than 90% of the 50+ surveyed investors view 2024 as the turnaround year for Indian startups. In contrast, only 7% of stakeholders believe that funding corrections, which have been going on for the last two years, could prove to be the dead weight Indian startups may have to carry for some more time. Nevertheless, early stage startups continue to be as resilient as ever, filled with their founders\u2019 passionate fervour to change this world for good. With that thought, we are happy to bring you the 49th cohort of\u00a0 \u2018 30 Startups To Watch \u2019 \u2014\u00a0 Inc42\u2019s much-awaited monthly series. In this cohort, we observed that a mere eight startups raised more than $1 Mn in funding, signalling the fading reliance on external capital. However, 16 early stage startups raised $1 Mn or below and the remaining were proudly bootstrapped. With this trend, it is safe to assume that the persistent funding correction has made early stage startups less reliant on initial funding. Meanwhile, around a quarter of these startups are in the D2C space, with the remaining spanning fields as diverse as cleantech, B2B SaaS, generative AI, edtech and gaming. Now, as we welcome the resurgence of optimism in the Indian startup space with the  annulment of angel tax  and  receding  funding winter, here are the 30 startups that caught our attention in July.

        "Article Content": "With Indian startups shifting their focus from growth at all costs to achieving sustainable profitability, the world\u2019s third-largest startup ecosystem is going through a paradigm shift. Unfortunately, this much-needed shift has come at a time when investors are restraining from writing large cheques, despite sitting on billions of dollars of dry powder. However, what stands out is the fact that taking lessons from past mistakes, Indian startups have now started to innovate like never before, achieving maturity and thereby becoming more promising bets for both domestic and international investors. Despite this upheaval in the startup ecosystem, innovation and the launch of new venture s have refused to stop on a dime. While the pace may not match that of 2-3 years ago, what\u2019s particularly intriguing is that these new ventures are largely being helmed by individuals who have previously held top roles in l arge corporations and startups. And continuing our tradition, we are back with the 39th edition of  30 Startups To Watch   to shine a spotlight on the early stage startups who are set to become disruptors of tomorrow. What makes these startups appealing is the way they have embraced technology to run businesses efficiently, with a key focus on solving real-world challenges. What\u2019s more fascinating is that at the core of the operations of many of these startups is their conscious efforts to serve environmental, social and governance (ESG) obligations. As many as 20 of the 30 startups that comprise the August edition of our endeavour to identify cream-of-the-crop early stage ventures operate in the B2B space, with none of them having raised more than $1.5 Mn in funding since their establishment. Incidentally, last month\u2019s edition of  30 Startups To Watch  featured 17 startups from the B2B segment.\u00a0 This also mirrors the trend that an increasing number of Indian founders today want to solve enterprise-level problems, thereby building a customer base that has lower acquisition costs but higher average revenue per user compared to their B2C counterparts. Without any further ado, here are the startups which caught o ur attention in August. Editor\u2019s Note:  The list below is not meant to be a ranking of any kind. We have listed the startups alphabetically. One of the primary obstacles in India\u2019s burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) sector is the dearth of essential components such as batteries, motors, and controllers.  Attron Automotive , a Pune-based startup, aims to handle this with an iron hand by introducing motors and controllers with advanced features. Mosam Ugemuge and Shubham Pode, schoolmates and now the founders of Attron, had long dreamed of becoming entrepreneurs one day. Their desire in this direction was fuelled when they collaborated on a race car project in their earlier years. In 2021, when the EV industry was booming, the duo shifted their focus from building a motorcycle to developing customised EV components, solving sourcing challenges for Indian EV OEMs. Later, Udhay Singh and Mohit Borkar, too, joined the startup as cofounders. Today, the startup\u2019s product line consists of high-performance electric motors and controllers tailored for various applications, including EVs, industrial machinery, defence systems, marine vessels, aviation, and agriculture.\u00a0 With its patented technology, Attron Automotive aims to enhance the performance of EVs in India while staying committed to meeting stringent environmental standards.\u00a0 The startup wants to enter the EV market with its offerings in 2024. Further, it plans to expand its product portfolio by incorporating e-drive systems, comprising a motor, controller, and gearbox, in its fancy lineup of products. Design plays a pivotal role in shaping a brand\u2019s identity, and it often constitutes a significant portion of a brand\u2019s expenses. To put things in perspective, the process of photographing products and formatting images to meet the diverse image guidelines of various ecommerce platforms can cost a lot. With a background in ecommerce, Vaibhav Prakash, Vishwanath Kollapudi, and Jamsheed Kamardeen recognised the challenges faced by small ecommerce businesses, as these often struggle to allocate substantial budgets for branding. In response to this, the trio came together to establish  Blend . The startup offers an AI photo editor, graphic designer, and poster maker platform for digital creators, small businesses, online sellers, ecommerce sellers and online resellers. The startup offers three flagship products \u2014 Background Remover, Magic Create and AI-generated background scenes. Magic Create, for instance, uses generative AI to create custom designs with a simple prompt.\u00a0 Similarly, its background scene-generating feature also deploys generative AI to develop backgrounds for product images. Lastly, Blend\u2019s background-removing tool does what it says on the tin \u2013 removes backgrounds from images for further editing. The startup also allows its users to edit images in batches. Blend also offers a DAAS (design-as-a-service) set of APIs that allow users to remove backgrounds from images and access the startup\u2019s growing library of templates to use in social media posts, ecommerce creatives and more. Today, on a global scale, India is known to foster one of the most reliable and robust banking systems. However, when it comes to catering to specific verticals like teenagers, couples, and freelancers, Indian banks have yet to scale up.\u00a0 Understand the need of the hour, a Bengaluru-based startup is focussed on resolving the evolving financial requirements of couples. Founded in 2022 by Srinivas Sarkar, and Kushagra Manglik,  Coupl  wants to position itself as a neobank for young couples and simplify their shared financial management. They provide a joint wallet equipped with two RuPay cards, one for each partner, facilitating shared expense management. Couples can pool funds into the Coupl Joint Wallet, execute shared payments via individual RuPay virtual cards, and establish auto-deposits.\u00a0 Additionally, Coupl has partnered with Bharat BillPay, an NPCI-powered service, to enable seamless utility bill payments through their app. The app is available on both the Google Play Store and the App Store. Traditional joint accounts are typically restricted to married or blood-related individuals, excluding unmarried couples, LGBTQ couples, and live-in partners. Coupl wants to disrupt this paradigm by offering a swift solution regardless of the relationship status. Even though insurance is vital for contingency planning in small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and startups, a substantial number of such companies often overlook the necessity of choosing required safety nets. Founded in 2023 by Ankit Kamra and Veera Thota, Bengaluru-based  Covrzy  aims to assist founders in securing their businesses against a variety of risks. The business insurance aggregator offers the right insurance recommendations for startups and SMEs based on their needs, such as workforce and category of work. However, Covrzy aspires to go beyond a conventional insurance aggregator. The founders claim the product will directly help founders and business owners navigate the complexities of business risk and insurance claims. For instance, its recommendation engine considers the specific details of an industry and sector to suggest coverage that\u2019s tailor-made for startups and SMEs. Further, businesses can complete the purchase of insurance entirely on WhatsApp thanks to the Covrzy chatbot. Covrzy claims to have onboarded more than 150 businesses as customers and is targeting 1,000 clients by the upcoming quarter. Despite being one of the largest contributors to the Indian economy, The Indian MSME sector continues to grapple with several issues, with easy access to financing being the most prominent one.\u00a0 To address this glaring gap, Shashwat Shrikhande and Saurabh Gupta founded  DailyPe , a lending tech startup, in 2023 to solve the daily cash flow needs of micro, small and medium-sized businesses. The Surat-based startup provides business loans to MSMEs such as medical stores, food joints, mobile repairing shops, and saloons, among others, which depend on daily revenues for their day-to-day operations. By offering daily loans, as low as INR 5K, DailyPe claims to ease bookkeeping efforts for such business owners. Not just this, DailyPe offers collateral-free loans at low-interest rates. It currently claims to have a portfolio value of more than INR 100 Cr. It aims to generate revenues to the tune of INR 30 Cr in 2024 and achieve a customer retention rate of 80%. Going forward, it wants to obtain a bank licence and build a portfolio size of INR 5,000 Cr with revenues of INR 1,000 Cr. It also aims to expand its offerings by taking multiple financial products such as savings, current and demat accounts, and insurance under its ambit. In a bid to unlock the full potential of the internet for Indian netizens, Himanshu Sharma and Nakul Kundra founded  Devnagri , an AI-enabled language translation platform, in 2019. Today, the platform can translate online content into all major Indian languages, including English. Not just this, Devnagri also offers translation for documents, websites, mobile apps, APIs, images, and searches. Along with this, the founders have developed a machine translation engine, which allows users to translate between languages automatically and the platform can also be trained to fit certain industry-specific contexts. Devnagri\u2019s translation services are powered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human translators. The AI helps to provide a quick and accurate translation, while human interventions ensure that the translations are accurate and culturally appropriate. The startup claims that it has 100+ paying users, which include brands like Zomato, Swiggy, Policybazaar, Meesho, and Network18. The startup earns revenues by offering subscription plans on a monthly and yearly basis. Hiring has always been a time-consuming process, as it sometimes takes anywhere between weeks to months for businesses to hire the right talent. Yet, there is a high chance of candidates backing out or not proving to be the right cultural fit, which may lead to high attrition rates. Having met at the Entrepreneur First (EF) cohort in 2021, a former researcher at IBM, Akshay Gugnani, and the cofounder of Koovs.com, Kanishk Shukla, joined hands to address this issue together, and from this partnership emerged  Expertia AI , an AI-enabled platform built to assist hiring teams across companies. The startup offers an AI-powered recruiting platform for end-to-end hiring, the Expertia Recruiter, which can go beyond the resume to understand the skills, personality and background of the candidate and provide a certain Expertia score.\u00a0 The platform not only identifies a candidate\u2019s skills but also pinpoints skill gaps. It actively engages with candidates on various fronts and makes them offer-ready. The startup boasts a user base of over 9,500 companies and has successfully screened and assessed more than 4 Mn professionals in less than a year. Expertia offers a freemium B2B SaaS subscription model. Users can get started for free and explore Expertia\u2019s ability to find professionals for them. Expertia subscriptions start as low as $200 a month and go as high as $10K or more for custom enterprise users. The startup has set a short-term goal to reach 10 Mn professionals and 25K+ companies using the platform. Expertia is poised to reach $1 Mn in annual revenue run rate (ARR) for FY24. Second-time entrepreneurs Ankit Durga and Megha Aggarwal got the idea for Fundamento while in the seventh year of their first startup, LEAP Skills.\u00a0 The duo noticed a gap when it came to customer support services through call centres. They realised that while companies were aware of the criticality of investing in customer support teams, the return on investment was low due to high attrition rates of agents and extended ramp-up periods, that is, training and onboarding. Fundamento  positions itself as an automation platform catering to customer contact centres. The platform consists of a multimodal, multilingual, API-centric stack, which becomes the core pillar for customer contact centres.\u00a0 Fundamento\u2019s AI stack is claimed to help companies transition from agent assistance to full automation of customer support at the lower levels. The Delhi NCR-based startup has forged partnerships with tech giants like IBM, Google, and Microsoft. In the last quarter, it claims to have also secured three large contracts from IndiaMart and two other enterprises. Its product offerings include Augment (agent copilot for query handling), Accelerate (agent copilot for task automation), and Automate (near-human AI bots for upstream customer interactions). Fundamento\u2019s pricing model offers per-agent, per-month subscriptions for Augment and Accelerate, while Automate operates on a pay-as-you-go basis, billed per minute of usage. Besides this, there\u2019s an initial one-time cost for tech integration and setup.\u00a0 In the next six months, Fundamento aims to secure 10-12 significant accounts and expand to the US market through channel partnerships. The startup plans to establish a global sales team by 2026 to support its potential client base in the US and eventually extend its reach to the APAC region. According to a consumer data intelligence  report  from 2022, more than 65% of Indians invest a part of their income in one form or another. Even though gold is one of the most popular investment vehicles, the connection with the yellow metal among younger generations appears to be diminishing. Understanding the need for \u2018fun\u2019 investment opportunities while working in the personal finance space, Parth Shah and Yaagni Raolji founded  GoldPe , a digital savings platform helping users start their gold investment journey with as little as INR 10. Not just this, every time users save INR 100, they earn 10 entries to the platform\u2019s weekly draw where they can win prizes in the range of INR 1 Lakh to INR 10 Lakh. The more users save, the more entries they receive, increasing their chances of winning cash prizes.\u00a0 The startup works on a commission-based revenue model and earns a commission on the amount saved in the digital gold. The app has 140K+ downloads on Google Play Store and Apple App Store. GoldPe has plans to expand its user base to 1 Mn and manage INR 100 Cr in assets under management (AUM) by 2024. The founders anticipate these numbers to increase 10X by 2026. Cycling holds a special place in everyone\u2019s childhood memories. However, in recent years, the cost of bicycles has been steadily rising, and as children grow, it becomes increasingly impractical to keep purchasing larger bikes to accommodate their growth. Established in 2021 by Roopesh Shah and Hrishikesh Halekote Shivanna,  GroClub  is dedicated to providing a bicycle subscription service rooted in sustainability. The startup offers bicycle subscriptions for individuals aged four and above.\u00a0 Customers can select their desired bicycle, which is then delivered fully assembled right to their doorstep. GroClub goes a step further by offering comprehensive service and maintenance throughout the entire subscription period, all while guaranteeing a lifetime warranty on all mechanical components. Upon completion of the subscription term, GroClub retrieves the bicycle and offers customers the option to receive a newer model if desired or renew the subscription for the existing one. Returned bicycles undergo a rejuvenation process, where the old frames are repurposed to create brand-new bicycles.\u00a0 Additionally, GroClub extends the opportunity for customers to purchase the bicycle outright at the end of their subscription, offering a generous 30% discount off the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price. What\u2019s more, the startup deducts the subscription cost from the total bill.\u00a0 GroClub also sells multiple bicycle accessories to fit the particular model. The startup is also planning to introduce multiple children-focused products soon, including car seats, carry cots, strollers and bunk beds to its repertoire. Efficient medical emergency response mechanisms are a major challenge in India. This is due to several alarming statistics which reveal that over 50% of ambulances  fail to arrive within 60 minutes  of a medical emergency, 90% of them  lack basic equipment , and 97% of them do not have  adequately trained personnel .\u00a0 Having spent more than 10,000 hours in emergency rooms in India and the UK, Dr Karan Raj Jaggi had seen the problem up close. His experiences with this problem drove Shubham Jain and Vedant Jain to come back to India and set up  Guardians  in 2022. The startup\u2019s approach revolves around a real-time emergency management system and a comprehensive network of ambulances and hospitals. This approach empowers them to address the critical prehospital phase of a patient\u2019s journey. To date, they have successfully established a network of more than 3,300 ambulances, 500-plus hospitals, and highly-trained dispatch officers. The medical emergency response platform claims to be able to connect patients to trained personnel in less than 10 seconds, taking 500-1,000 emergency calls per month. The startup has developed systems that help users make decisions during medical emergencies. The startup\u2019s core revenue stream is Protect, a subscription plan that includes a medical emergency plan and zero ambulance charges, among other things. Users can sign up for the plan for as low as INR 49 per user per month. Guardians also makes money via monthly service fees it charges from hospitals for using its network. Presently, operational in Delhi NCR and Bengaluru, Guardians has plans to expand to 100 cities by the end of 2024. Additionally, the company is forming partnerships with health insurance providers to extend its protective services to the masses. User research is an imperative step for any product-based company, as such research methods can help companies find the right product-market fit faster than their peers. More often than not, user research is time-consuming, slow and difficult to scale, which can lead to problems in the future. Understanding this, second-time cofounders Geetika and Jashish Kambli incorporated  Humanify  in 2022. The startup offers a remote research platform called ExploraStory, which allows businesses to conduct user research without stepping foot outside of their offices. ExploraStory helps businesses directly connect with their users via a secure video call, providing companies with much-needed pace and context in their research results. The startup claims to cut down research conclusion time significantly \u2013 from weeks to mere days \u2013 which is crucial in a fast-paced startup environment. After connecting with users, businesses can then ask them to complete tasks or answer questions while they are using their products or services. ExploraStory monitors users\u2019 screen activities, audio and videos, which are then analysed by Humanify\u2019s AI platform to provide insights into their behaviour and experience. Humanify offers a subscription-based pricing model for the platform, allowing companies to choose from a variety of plans based on their needs and budget. According to a report by IBEF, India\u2019s housekeeping market was worth $6 Bn in 2022, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% between 2023 and 2028. However, much of this market is fragmented and unorganised, making it difficult for businesses to hire housekeepers. Bringing some meaning to the madness is  humblx . Founded by Samir Dayal Singh, Ujjwal Kumar, and Yadev Jayachandran in 2018, the startup helps enterprises manage housekeeping and janitorial staff effectively through its SaaS solution.\u00a0 Via humblx\u2019s QR-based solution, staff managers can schedule shifts, create and assign tasks for the housekeeping staff, track their progress, and receive notifications when tasks are completed. The platform also generates reports and analytics for better efficiency. The platform also offers remote monitoring of staff and public feedback on their performance.\u00a0 The startup offers usage-based plans, with its basic plan starting at INR 200 per QR code per month. Some of humblx\u2019s top clients include Sulabh, State Health Society Maharashtra, AIIMS Patna, and Garv Toilets, among others. AI automation tools are emerging as an integral part of the modern sales stack, not just for their ability to streamline productivity and processes, but also to enhance and drive revenue growth. IIT alumni Shivam Gupta and Akshat Anand drew upon their experience in natural language processing (NLP) development to launch a summarisation tool that simplifies note-taking during meetings. This idea became the seed for  Instaminutes  which was founded in 2021 as an AI assistant tailored for revenue teams, which claims to boost their productivity by over 2X. Powered by InstaGPT, a specialised ChatGPT framework, it automates non-productive tasks. What sets it apart is its capacity for continuous improvement through training and optimisation.\u00a0 The core tech of Instaminutes is patent-pending \u2014 the startup has filed for a patent in India and is also planning to file applications in the US and UK within the next six months. The founders want to position it as ChatGPT integrated with the popular productivity apps, capable of summarising meetings, and emails, updating CRMs, and executing recurring tasks with a simple command. While currently available only in English, the roadmap includes support for Hindi, Spanish, French, and more. The startup\u2019s go-to-market strategy includes SEO and content marketing, Google Search Ads, and LinkedIn engagement. Right now, Instaminutes operates a freemium revenue model, offering essential features for free and pro, and advanced versions through monthly or annual subscriptions.\u00a0 At a time when artificial intelligence-driven products and services are increasingly gaining popularity across sectors and industries, the constantly-evolving tech, AI, has found a use case in the cookware segment as well.\u00a0 In a bid to make the lives of individuals or professional chefs easier by making cooking a hassle-free affair, with a core focus on healthy meals, Ahmedabad-based  On2Cook  entered the cookware market in 2022.\u00a0 Founded by Sanandan Sudhir, the startup, with its AI-based connected cooking devices, is on a mission to make cooking at home or restaurants more efficient, thereby saving a lot of time for individuals living a fast-paced lifestyle. According to the founder, Sudhir, the product reduces the time and effort that go into cooking by 70% and 50%, respectively. Further, the product speeds up the cooking process without compromising on the quality of the meals \u2014 nutrients, natural colour and texture. Last year, the cookware startup secured seed funding of INR 17 Cr from angel investors. Besides ensuring faster and better quality food at an economical price point, On2Cook can be operated via a smartphone app.\u00a0 According to the  Asian Development Bank , hydrogen demand is set to rise to 15-25 Mn metric tonnes per annum by 2040, taking the market to $35 Bn by then. This growth can be attributed to the numerous practical applications of this highly flammable gas in industries such as steel manufacturing, fuel cells, fertilisers, and refineries. Capitalising on this opportunity is  Ossus Biorenewables , a  green hydrogen startup , which specialises in providing process industries with on-site, on-demand green hydrogen using the waste carbon present in on-site effluents. This approach eliminates the need for storing, compressing, and transporting hydrogen. The startup has developed its proprietary autonomous bioreactors \u2013 the OB HydraCel \u2013 that use the organic content of industrial effluents as feedstock for green hydrogen production. Pending patents in India, Japan and Italy, the OB HydraCel can produce one gram of hydrogen from a similar quantity of organic content in effluent. One of Ossus Biorenewables\u2019 unique advantages lies in its bioreactors\u2019 ability to recycle effluent by consuming both organic and inorganic components, making it available for reuse on-site. Ossus operates on a build-own-operate model, which implies that the potential customer has to pay for every kilogram of hydrogen produced, apart from a nominal installation fee. Ossus sells green hydrogen at $0.5-1.2 per kilogram, depending on the organic content in the industrial effluent and the chain length of the primary organic chemicals contributing to production. The business model has put the startup on a revenue run rate of INR 37.9 Cr for the upcoming year. The startup has set up shop in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand, with another plant coming up in Ahmedabad, which will help it take green hydrogen production to 5 metric tonnes per day. The startup also has a demo plant in Bengaluru, producing 500 litres of green hydrogen daily. Ossus\u2019 long-term goal is to boost its production to 20,000 metric tonnes per day by 2026. While shoppers are increasingly showing interest in D2C brands, they ultimately turn to larger marketplaces like Amazon or Flipkart due to the more seamless delivery experience, especially same-day delivery.\u00a0 To enable all ecommerce startups with same-day delivery experience, logistics startup  Pikndel  comes with a network of shared dark stores which tackle the problem of last-mile delivery.\u00a0 Brands can store their products in the startup\u2019s dark stores for ultra-fast 4-hour deliveries and the company also collects products directly from existing brand-owned warehouses for same-day delivery. The Delhi NCR-based startup charges a fixed fee on brands for every order it fulfils, while it is currently operating in the capital as well as Mumbai and Bengaluru, two high-volume hubs for D2C brands.\u00a0 Over the next year, Pikndel aims to expand its same-day delivery services to all Tier-I cities in India. The startup\u2019s roadmap includes an AI-based product that it claims will provide a personalised experience to shoppers in its delivery network. As per a  report , India\u2019s food services industry is set to create 10 Mn jobs by 2025, with hundreds of thousands of establishments looking for job-ready individuals. However, hiring is a major challenge for this space given the highly unorganised nature of the domain. To change this, Ram Vaibhav Kumaran and Adrien Jasserand set up  Recipeat , a job marketplace for the hospitality industry, in 2022. The platform connects job seekers in the hospitality industry with establishments seeking workers across roles such as waiters, cleaners, baristas, receptionists, and stewards, among others. The Bengaluru-based startup onboards restaurants, hotels and other establishments, allowing them to make job listings on its platform.\u00a0 The startup charges INR 4,000 (excluding GST) per month for a single listing, with pricing going up to INR 22,500 (excluding GST) per month for up to five listings. Recipeat also offers custom pricing plans for establishments looking to list more than five jobs per month. Lendingtech has become the largest market opportunity within fintech and is set to rise to $1.3 Tn in size by 2030,  per  Inc42  data . Lending has also emerged as a viable option for many fintech startups to hit profitability and grow sustainably. However, many fintech startups simply lack the technical know-how to set up a lending infrastructure. Having worked in finance and banking for nearly two decades, Raman Vig and Sudipta Ghosh set up  Roopya  in 2022 to provide fintech startups with the means to kickstart their digital lending ventures in under five minutes through the Roopya Money product suite. Roopya offers four key solutions \u2013 AI Insights, Loan Origination System, CRM for Fintechs and Loan Origination Platform. The startup\u2019s analytics platform gives insights into bureau data, alternate data and customer behaviour data, allowing fintechs to predict their customers\u2019 needs and act accordingly. Roopya is also a part of India\u2019s OCEN (Open Credit Enablement Network) network. The startup\u2019s loan origination system connects a B2B user with hundreds of LSPs (loan service providers) to generate leads. At the same time, Roopya\u2019s loan origination platform, a cloud-based, automated platform, helps lenders to originate and underwrite loans. Lastly, the startup also offers a CRM platform designed for fintech startups to manage lending operations. The startup has two pricing plans, one each for a credit institution and an LSP. For the former, Roopya charges INR 3.75 Lakh per month, alongside INR 95 per transaction. An LSP can avail the startup\u2019s products at INR 5.5 Lakh per month, along with INR 125 per transaction. Agriculture is India\u2019s largest industry, with nearly 55% of the country\u2019s population directly relying on agriculture and related sectors for their livelihoods. According to statistics from Inc42, the Indian agritech sector is projected to grow to $24 Bn by 2025, highlighting the pressing need for agricultural modernisation in the country. Recognising this need, Sat Kumar Tomer and Yukti Gill founded  Satyukt  in 2018, a  SaaS startup harnessing satellite technology  to provide advisory services to customers. The company has developed proprietary technology capable of swiftly measuring soil nutrient content, enabling farmers to assess soil quality through their mobile devices without the need for on-site visits. Satyukt offers four primary products: Sat2Farm, Sat4Agri, Sat4Risk, and Sat2Credit. Sat2Farm is a mobile app that delivers real-time data to farmers, including information on soil moisture, crop health, and crop yield potential. Sat4Agri offers agricultural enterprises insights into crop acreage, growth stages, and distribution. Sat4Risk supplies crop insurance companies with data regarding crop health and yield potential. Lastly, Sat2Credit assists BFSI\u00a0 institutions in evaluating a farm\u2019s creditworthiness. The startup provides its services in nine different languages and boasts an impressive client roster that includes Marico, Mahindra, Bosch, Adani, IIM Bangalore, and CISCO, among others. Skill development is one of the fastest-growing sub-segments within the Indian edtech space and is set to become a $2.5 Bn market opportunity by 2030, as per an Inc42 report. While working with Kuku FM, the trio of Rohit Choudhary, Keertay Agarwal and Yash Banwani realised that there was a high demand for educational content in regional Indian languages. As such, they started building  Seekho , a  learning-focussed edutainment platform  offering skill-development courses. The platform offers engaging bite-sized videos around technology, money and business categories in Hindi and Bangla.  The content is created by experts and is curated to deliver a fun learning experience. Seekho focuses on edutainment, crafting an engaging learning environment that merges education with entertainment. Seekho monetises its platform via a subscription model. A user can subscribe to unlock all available content on the platform for INR 199 per month, as the startup continues to focus on affordability. The startup plans to tap an ARR of $10 Mn by 2024, which currently stands at $1 Mn and is growing 35% MoM. A recent Amazon India report showed that there were more than 10 Lakh sellers active on its ecommerce platform, making it one of the largest online retailers in the country. While it offers advertisement services to sellers to be more competitive, there are only a few sellers who can effectively leverage Amazon\u2019s advertising tools. Having witnessed the problem first-hand, Athmajith Colote, Yogendra R. and Andrew Jervis set up  SellerGeni  in 2020 to help brands and sellers accelerate growth and automate ads through its suite of tools on Amazon. Brands working on Amazon can connect their Amazon accounts and get intelligent recommendations on strategy automation. The startup claims to automate 98% of the user\u2019s day-to-day activities in the first seven days of onboarding. The startup has two key products, GrowZ and AisleDominator, which help brands execute complex growth strategies in just a few steps. SellerGeni\u2019s tools allow users to know what is not working in their campaigns, why it is not working and how users can improve the outcome. The startup charges users based on their ad spend on Amazon, with plans starting from $100 per month. Having gained 100+ users, SellerGeni is on course for a $700K ARR for FY24, growing at 20% MoM. The SaaS platform is active across geographies, though 51% of its clients come from India.\u00a0 Moving forward, SellerGeni is looking to expand to the US, Canada and Japan by 2024, adding support for other platforms, including Meta, Google, Walmart and Flipkart (subject to API availability). There is hardly any kid in this world who will say no to an ice pop or maybe two. While several brands manufacture ice pops in the highly fragmented Indian market, there is hardly any brand offering healthier popsicles that are largely free of sugar and artificial flavours. To change this, Ravi and Anuja Kabra decided to set up  Skippi Ice Pops  in Hyderabad in 2020. While the husband-wife duo faced initial teething issues during the pandemic, the brand took off in 2021. Today, the startup offers popsicles in more than five flavours, cream rolls and cornsticks via an omnichannel retail business model. The products are made using all-natural ingredients and flavours and use only RO water for their ice pops. Skippi sells via its website and quick commerce apps. It also has a distribution network of 200+ stockists and distributors across India. The startup claims to manufacture its products using a patented technology. Skippi appeared on \u2018 Shark Tank India\u2019  in 2021 and secured an \u2018All-Shark deal\u2019 in the process. The startup claims to be on a sharp growth trajectory, recording a 40X growth in revenue last year and receiving orders worth INR 2-2.8 Cr per month. Over the past few years, the mom and baby care segment has emerged as one of the fastest-growing sectors in the Indian startup ecosystem. This can be substantiated by the fact that the country today fosters more than 6K startups, which offer baby products and services to parents. Founded by Akshay and Anshul Arya, Delhi NCR-based  StarAndDaisy  aids parents in their parenting journey with its products, including prams, cribs and cradles, baby walkers, study tables for kids, and toys, among other babycare items. StarAndDaisy\u2019s lineup of products is available across marketplaces such as Amazon, Flipkart, and Firstcry. The startup roped in Indian actor Ameesha Patel as its brand ambassador last year. The Indian cold chain market is highly unorganised, and it is due to this fragmented nature of this sector that many businesses that trade in perishable goods have no other option but to depend on rudimentary solutions like using ice slabs, dry ice or cost-intensive solutions like a refrigerated truck. Notably, even though the country has cold storage that is run on solar panels; however, these solar-powered centres lack efficiencies on various fronts. During their research days at IIT Madras in 2015, Dr Soumalya Mukherjee, Dr Shiv Sharma, and Dr Rajani Kant Rai were working on phase change materials (PCM), a substance which releases or absorbs sufficient energy at phase transition to provide useful heat or cooling. This research enabled them to manufacture PCM for the thermal management of supply chains. As a result,  tan90  came into existence in 2019. The startup manufactures 20 tonnes of inorganic PCM daily in various form factors, including sachets for short usages to panels for lengthier usages, at its Chennai plant. The startup has developed its PCMs and can serve temperatures between -24 to +50\u00b0C for applications across industries such as frozen, chilled and ambient food products, pharmaceuticals and biological samples. These PCMs have pending patent applications in India. The startup also offers Cooling-as-a-Service (CaaS), which is aimed at customers who are in the mid-mile movement and have been using dry ice and refrigerated trucks. Via its PCM-based solutions, customers can use normal trucks for the movement of frozen products. For the same, the startup provides pre-frozen PCM panels on a lease to maintain the temperature inside ice boxes. tan90 has two primary revenue streams \u2013 selling PCMs directly and leasing them via CaaS. The startup sells PCMs across India, UAE, Oman, Philippines, Germany, and South Korea, while CaaS is available in Chennai, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Delhi NCR, and Hyderabad. The startup plans to ramp up its CaaS to six more cities, while its long-term plans include expansion into the SEA market and HVAC services. The sneaker culture is one of the biggest subcultures within the fashion industry, and India is no exception. According to research firm Allied Market Research, India\u2019s sneaker market reached $3 Bn in size in 2023 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.18% between 2023 and 2028. However, some of the most coveted sneakers are beyond the reach of many. Having witnessed the absence of good sneakers, Vedant Lamba founded  The Mainstreet Marketplace  in 2017. The initiative first started as a YouTube channel and eventually became  a reselling marketplace . Today, the platform has expanded to include other fashion goods such as watches, handbags, t-shirts, and more. Currently, the startup lists more than 8,000 SKUs on its platform. The Mainstreet Marketplace follows a C2B2C business model, which means that the platform connects individual sellers to buyers. The startup acquires stock from sellers and then ships it to buyers from its locations in Delhi and Mumbai. The Mainstreet Marketplace also allows users to pay for their products in instalments via MNST Pay Later at zero extra cost or interest. The startup earns a commission on each product sold on its platform. Its YouTube channel, which now has more than 100K subscribers, also contributes to its overall revenues. The Mainstreet Marketplace recently achieved INR 100 Cr in annualised revenue run rate and is gearing up to launch its in-house range of products, MNST Gear. In the long term, the startup is working on expanding its retail business to four more countries beyond India. Companies are now mandated to report the environmental impact of their activities in the form of ESG reports. However, while attempts have been made to introduce a standardised system, many companies have internal metrics to showcase environmental impact, which may not be accurate and unbiased. Having witnessed the problem first-hand while working with farmers to develop and implement climate-friendly land management practices, Navarun\u00a0 Atraya and Vishan Ravi Tejaas established  Transitry , a climate tech startup, in 2021. Transitry, an AI-enabled platform, provides digital MRV (measurement, reporting and verification) solutions to help organisations measure, report and verify their carbon emissions.\u00a0 The startup also allows organisations to track their carbon footprint, identify opportunities to reduce emissions and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability metrics. The platform helps organisations, businesses, government departments and NGOs compile and verify their carbon emissions data, which is essential for complying with carbon reporting requirements. Transitry\u2019s advisory services help companies develop and implement climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. The startup also guides how to access green finance, used to invest in climate-friendly projects.\u00a0 Pretty much nothing has changed the dynamics of the tech industry in the past decade as much as generative AI.\u00a0 An increasing number of organisations are jumping on the AI bandwagon now with the proliferation of ChatGPT-based tools, so naturally, the market is ripe for early innovation in this domain.\u00a0 Like  WorkHack , a startup founded in early 2023 by Akshat Tyagi, started off exploring some use cases in HR and marketing, before turning its  focus to data collection via generative AI . The startup is targeting pre-sales areas such as lead generation, lead qualification, quote generation, and order creation where ChatGPT can automate repetitive manual tasks.\u00a0 Going forward, the startup aims to cater to solutions down the funnel, i.e., after customers are brought on board, with features targeting engagement, retention, and cancellation. WorkHack operates on a subscription-based pricing model, billing users monthly. It claims to be catering to businesses that have workforces ranging from 10,000 to 2,00,000 individuals. The pricing ranges from INR 7-INR 3 per user per month. The startup currently serves customers in the Indian and US markets.\u00a0 Bengaluru-based  Xylem , which positions itself as an AI infra provider, is building a low-code platform for software development teams to build, manage, and deploy production-ready AI models into their products. Founded in 2023 by Arko Chattopadhyay, Enrique Ferrao and Pranav Reddy, Xylem has various use cases for developers. With the help of Xylem, developers can simply connect their data source, choose from its embed models, decide on resources and select the required LLM model. \n The startup\u2019s proprietary search and ranking engine, RavenX, integrates both keyword and semantic search, which helps reduce LLM costs and latency as well as eliminate inefficiencies by processing relevant data.\u00a0 Xylem is planning to release the first public build of the platform by 2024 and aims to clock in $75K-$100K ARR in the same year. Xylem AI is looking to capture the growing global market of the AI enablement layer. In the short term, the startup also plans to train its in-house AI engines for use cases in businesses beyond generative AI. Although India has been one of the major pharmacy markets in the world, supply-chain issues remain a major pain point internally.\u00a0 Understanding that the fragmented nature of supply chains makes the procurement process complex and hampers the quality of products, Amit Sah and Umesh Sharma founded  Zoplar  to simplify medical supply procurement with a one-stop platform for all healthcare requirements.\u00a0\u00a0 Incorporated in 2022, the Gurugram-based startup makes the procurement of medical supplies more convenient and cost-effective, thereby giving hospitals and manufacturers of medical equipment a much-needed respite. Zoplar offers access to a wide range of products eliminates pricing and inventory complexity and ensures quality delivery and after-sales experiences.\u00a0 The medical supplies provider counts Titan Capital, Saison Capital, and Beenext as its investors. It claims to have over 250 clients and delivered 50,000-plus units across more than 7,000 pin codes in India. [Edited by Shishir Parashar]",

        "Article Content": "Ever since launching the first edition of \u201830 Startups To Watch\u2019 in February 2020,  Inc42  has aided the discovery of 1,200+ new startups. In this journey of more than three years, we have kept a close watch on the Indian startup ecosystem, which underwent significant transformations \u2014 some much-needed, others forced by market conditions. As the days of generous inflow of capital into the ecosystem turned into investors exercising caution for months on end, the Indian entrepreneurial spirit has remained largely unaffected. More and more founders are entering the Indian startup ecosystem with more grit and ambitions to solve real-world problems with their Midas touch. It is off the back of this positive stead that the number of government-recognised startups in the country has more than tripled since 2020 to  1 Lakh as of September 2023 .   This is exactly what has fuelled our ambition to find more pathbreaking new-age ventures over the years, as we remain steadfast in our mission of identifying newer startups every month.\u00a0 With that said, we present the 40th edition of \u2018 30 Startups To Watch \u2019 . We believe these ventures have immense potential to not only disrupt their respective playgrounds but also transform the world. In this edition, we have covered startups from various sectors, including cleantech, generative AI and D2C, among many others.\u00a0 Before we set the stage for this month\u2019s 30 startups, we should also mention the ongoing funding winter and the fact that it has dragged on for too long. Making it 18 months of near-continuous decline in the third quarter of 2023, startup funding was at a three-quarter low of a mere $1.7 Bn, according to Inc42\u2019s \u2018Indian Startup Funding Report Q3 2023\u2019 report. Further, year-on-year funding for this period tanked by 43.8%, with funding deals plummeting 38.6% compared to Q3 2022. Despite this, Indian entrepreneurs have displayed remarkable resilience and determination. And rather than retreating, more and more new ventures continue to add muscle to the world\u2019s third-largest startup ecosystem.\u00a0 Editor\u2019s Note:  The list below is not a ranking of any kind. We have listed the startups alphabetically. \n As the world seeks alternatives to environmentally harmful materials, biomaterials sourced from agricultural residue have gained prominence. While a majority has turned to recycled materials, biomaterials \u2013 materials sourced from crop residue \u2013 are another key variable in the sustainability equation. Addressing the need for these biomaterials materials is  altM . Founded in 2022 by Apoorv Garg and Yugal Raj Jain, both ex-Tesla employees, altM aims to develop and manufacture sustainable materials from agricultural residue to help companies reduce their carbon footprints and increase circularity in their supply chains. altM uses lignocellulosic agricultural residues as their raw material to produce advanced materials as alternatives to unsustainable incumbents. Lignocellulosic residue refers to dry plant residue and includes wheat, rice, barley straw, corn stover, sorghum stalks, coconut husks, sugarcane bagasse and banana leaves. Given its sustainability potential and functional properties, lignocellulosic residue can be used to develop materials such as paper, biofuels and polymers. Retaining existing customers is the top priority for product-based companies, as customer churn can significantly impact their bottom line.  AppEQ.ai , founded by Rajat Shukla and Manoranjan Ingudam, offers an AI-based copilot platform to help businesses preserve their revenue streams by improving customer retention. AppEQ.ai provides a unified view of each customer account by integrating seamlessly with a company\u2019s existing CRM and help desk systems. By using machine learning, it generates valuable customer insights, identifies patterns, and detects trends that can be used to enhance customer retention strategies. For example, the platform can flag customers who haven\u2019t recently used a product or contacted customer support, enabling proactive measures to address their needs. It also identifies upselling and cross-selling opportunities, boosting revenue retention. AppEQ.ai offers a subscription-based pricing model starting at $25 per user per month, with pricing tiers based on features and the number of users. In the competitive landscape of customer retention, AppEQ.ai empowers businesses with actionable insights to reduce churn and bolster revenue. \n Founded in 2022 by Krutika Lal and Satyajit Mittal,  Aretto  is a kids\u2019 footwear brand. It wants to emerge as a prominent player in the children\u2019s footwear market in India while offering quality, and comfort for young wearers.\u00a0 Earlier this year, Aretto secured a patent for its innovative sole technology, making it one of the pioneering brands in India to receive such recognition.  Aretto\u2019s unique selling proposition lies in the ability of its products to intuitively sense and adapt to children\u2019s growth patterns, expanding up to 3 sizes to provide the perfect fit. Looking ahead, Aretto has plans for global expansion, targeting markets such as the US, the UK, and the UAE. Currently headquartered in Pune, Aretto is poised to introduce a comprehensive product line in the children\u2019s footwear market. \n Lifestyle diseases like diabetes and obesity are on the rise in India, especially in the country\u2019s metropolitan and Tier I and II cities. One of the major contributors to this rising trend is that more and more Indians have distanced themselves from following a healthy lifestyle due to their ever-increasing workload to put bread on the table. As per a recent survey, only about 0.5% of India\u2019s total population goes to a gym or exercise regularly.\u00a0 With a vision to democratise data-driven personal training for preventive healthcare, Anurag Dani, Rohit Patel, Amal George, and Aman Rai founded  Aroleap  in 2020. The startup uses cutting-edge technology to deliver personalised insights and training built on strong foundations of science-backed fitness knowledge. Its Aroleap X is a smart, wall-mounted gym equipment designed for comprehensive weight training. What sets the Aroleap X apart is its patented motor-powered electromagnetic resistance technology, which simulates the sensation of traditional weights. This groundbreaking equipment is effective and portable as it occupies very little wall space, making it a practical choice for all.\u00a0 Not just this, Aroleap goes beyond conventional fitness equipment by precisely tracking user movements and mapping strength-related data, which is then utilised to identify imbalances and tailor a highly personalised fitness regime based on individual goals, strengths, and weaknesses. Aroleap primarily operates in the B2C segment and has priced its home gym, the Aroleap X, at a competitive price of INR 1.99 Lakh per unit. Furthermore, the startup has strategically partnered with various hospitality chains to accommodate bulk orders, expanding its reach and influence in the fitness industry. \n The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) has gained significant traction in the Indian ecommerce segment over the past few months, with numerous startups and enterprises now joining the government\u2019s digital commerce network. However, setting up shop on the ONDC network can be challenging for less tech-savvy companies. Bitsila , established by Dasharatham Bitla in 2020, aims to assist these companies in joining the ONDC ecosystem.

A typical photovoltaic cell can only convert around 15-20% of the sunlight it receives into electricity, making it a less efficient process than generating electricity from other renewable sources such as wind (30-40%) and hydroelectricity (90%).\u00a0 Ellipsol , a Delhi NCR-based startup founded in 2022 by Samarth Jain and Kaustubh Tyagi, claims to \u201cBrighten The Sun\u201d by doubling the energy generation capability of a solar panel at only 10% additional cost. To be sure, there are several ways the efficiency of a solar panel can be improved \u2013 anti-reflective coatings and microinverters can take the efficiency up from around 15% to 20%, but none of the conventional methods doubles it. The startup\u2019s core product is a retrofittable solution, which it claims can double the yield of conventional photovoltaic solar panels. It can potentially be installed across all existing solar panels.\u00a0 Jain and Tyagi, who have previously worked together on an energy storage startup, Baud Resources, are currently working in stealth mode. As such, the specifics of the technology behind Ellipsol\u2019s solution remain undisclosed. Thousands of SaaS companies have come up across the world, each competing with dozens that offer similar products and services over a similar sliver of market share. Given the competitive landscape in the space, conveying the right message plays a pivotal role in aligning the needs of individuals or businesses with your products and services. Understanding this, Vartika Bansal and Vidyasankar Krishnamurthy founded  Floik  in 2022. Bansal\u2019s struggle to find, purchase, and effectively implement SaaS tools led to the ideation of Floik, a platform that showcases SaaS products effectively.

However, video content generation remains a complex and time-consuming endeavour, involving meticulous planning, execution, production, and editing. Streamlining this process is  Justbaat , a video creation platform harnessing AI to simplify video production for users. It empowers users to create digital avatars, translate videos into 63 languages, and generate videos from text inputs.  Users can initiate video creation by uploading text, images, or videos onto the platform, which then utilises AI to generate a video based on the provided input. The startup also offers the capability to craft lifelike images of individuals to serve as \u2018anchors\u2019 for video content. Justbaat\u2019s AI models recreate the person\u2019s voice, enabling content creation without requiring audio inputs. Furthermore, users can generate videos in various formats and export the final product to platforms like YouTube. Despite a plethora of kidswear options in the market, a significant portion of these products is made from synthetic materials, which can lead to allergies or skin irritations. Recognising the need for natural materials in kidswear, Swapnil Srivastav, Mohammad Hussain, and Aman Kumar Mahto founded  Kidbea  in 2021. Kidbea is a kidswear brand that utilises bamboo to create its products. Kidbea claims to address common issues such as germs from food spillage, skin rashes, and discomfort in newborns through its patent-filed herbal spill-proof textile technology, which also has antibacterial properties.

India is surrounded by three major water bodies \u2013 the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The larger Indian Ocean Region, which comprises these three regions, is a major travel route as 80% of the world\u2019s maritime oil passes through this area, as per US Air Force University. However, this region is also fraught with issues such as piracy. Founded in 2023 by ex-ISRO scientist Gaurav Seth and former US-based National Instruments employee Vinit Bansal,  PierSight  keeps a watchful eye over the high seas in all weather conditions, 24/7. The Ahmedabad-based startup manages this via a constellation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging and Automatic Identification System (AIS) satellites. PierSight\u2019s objective is to provide continuous monitoring of maritime operations in 30-minute intervals, a service it claims to be unparalleled in the industry. The startup\u2019s engagements span a diverse spectrum of clients, including island nations, commerce divisions of governments and environmental agencies, all of which share a pressing concern about the pervasive exploitation of Exclusive Economic Zones. Over the next two years, PierSight is poised to launch the world\u2019s first commercial satellite integrating SAR and AIS capabilities. The startup\u2019s commitment to this endeavour is fully aligned with the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goal 14, which underscores the importance of conserving and sustainably utilising oceans and marine resources for the benefit of present and future generations. According to a 2022  research paper , 18% of Indian adults suffered from chronic gastrointestinal problems, with numbers only rising with age. While India has seen a surge in people becoming more health-conscious post-pandemic, those already suffering from chronic gastrointestinal issues face hurdles in getting the correct care. Peping  founders Prateek Maheshwari and Chirag Maheshwari saw the gap for an end-to-end chronic gastric management and health platform, and they went the digital way to solve the problem. Founded in 2022, the startup offers care plans for managing diseases and disorders such as IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth), GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and Dyspepsia, among others. The solution includes a holistic and personalised approach to dietary interventions (focus on healthy eating) with lifestyle interventions (stress management, physical activity).\u00a0 Peping\u2019s team of gastro and hepatology doctors, nutritionists and lifestyle coaches claim to deliver a patient-centric care plan to manage and reverse chronic gut health issues that have become especially prevalent thanks to urbanised lifestyles. The company has a suite of products with proprietary formulations containing high-quality probiotics. Currently, the startup is focused on finding the right go-to-market approach and is testing various strategies to streamline its unit economics. Many startups and corporations are integrating generative AI capabilities into their products to enhance customer experiences. From recipe suggestions to improved product listings, the applications are diverse. However, managing and deploying large language models (LLMs) can be complex. Founded in 2023 by Google alumni Rohit Agarwal and Ayush Garg,  Portkey.ai  simplifies this process.

Portkey.ai\u2019s platform is available as a cloud-based SaaS product, eliminating the need for businesses to set up complex infrastructure. Companies pay a monthly fee based on the number of LLMs they manage and the volume of traffic they route through the platform. As of July 31, 2023, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) reported 10,967 operational public EV charging stations in India, equipped with 15,493 EV chargers. Despite the government\u2019s ambitious goal of installing 5 Lakh public EV charging stations by 2027, the rapid surge in EV adoption across India has outpaced the growth of public charging infrastructure. The inception of  Rebolt  dates back to 2021, when its founders, Murali Shankar and Sunil Prabhakar, recognised the crucial need for robust charging infrastructure to foster EV adoption. The startup is on a mission to create what it proudly claims as India\u2019s largest public EV charging network, strategically placing charging stations in urban hubs, along highways and in key commercial areas. Through the Rebolt mobile app, EV owners can effortlessly locate charging stations on a map, reserve charging slots in advance, or check real-time charger availability before arriving. Once at the charging station, EV owners can scan a QR code to initiate charging, with automatic payment deducted from their wallet upon session completion. Rebolt charges a uniform rate of INR 18 per kilowatt nationwide, but they also offer a subscription plan that grants users unlimited charging for a monthly fee. Additionally, Rebolt generates revenue through partnerships with businesses hosting their chargers. Hosts are provided with a comprehensive dashboard that allows them to manage their charger locations, track bookings and usage, monitor commissions due, process payments, and more. India has one of the largest populations of online shoppers in the world, with the number set to reach 350 Mn by 2025. However, the prevalence of dark patterns on major online shopping sites ensures that customers end up spending more than they should, shrinking their savings. This enabled Aman Singh and Priyesh Gandhi to incorporate  SayF , a platform that empowers users to save money while shopping online. The startup, which has partnered with over 400 brands, offers discounts ranging from 3% to 15% on top of brand or platform discounts.\u00a0 Users can access these discounts by selecting SayF\u2019s gift card as their payment method during checkout. Following a transaction, the app invests the discount\u2019s value into the user\u2019s SayF account, which can then be utilised to invest in various financial products. SayF\u2019s flagship product is its savings platform, allowing users to either save while shopping or set specific savings rules for regular saving and improved returns. The startup primarily earns commissions from brand partnerships and stands to gain commissions when users invest their savings via SayF\u2019s platform.\u00a0 Currently, SayF is developing a UPI layer and plans to evolve it into a Credit-on-UPI system by 2024, with a target of reaching 1 Mn users by then. In the long term, SayF aims to expand globally, integrate blockchain capabilities, and reach 10 Mn users by 2026. Reporting financial performance is one of the most crucial activities for any for-profit company, as they have a fiduciary responsibility towards their stakeholders and sector regulators to present their performance. However, this task is far from simple, especially for tech startups with complex business models and intricate revenue recognition systems. Having been in the finance industry for nearly two decades, Ganesh Kumar and Sumedha saw the struggles of highly qualified professionals being reduced to the mundane tasks of putting out financial statements. The duo, themselves qualified chartered accountants, came up with the idea of an AI-enabled financial reporting system, setting up  Sheshi AI  in 2021.\u00a0 The startup\u2019s reporting platform, Sheshi FR, generates financial reports in under 30 minutes. The platform delivers print-ready financial statements that can be digitally signed and submitted for audits. The platform seamlessly integrates with major ERP systems, effortlessly fetching financial data. Additionally, AI-enabled ledger tagging minimises errors, ensuring streamlined data interpretation. Users also enjoy the flexibility to customise financial reports while remaining compliant with the latest GAAP regulations. Sheshi AI operates on an annual subscription model for its SaaS platform. The startup\u2019s short-term plans involve refining its product further and expanding into new geographies. With the rise in the disposable income of individuals, India has witnessed a spurt in the demand for luxury goods, especially office and travel bags. According to Statista, luxury bags are now a $1.4 Bn market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.51% annually till 2028. However, such goods have a major environmental impact, which can\u2019t be overlooked. In a bid to cull the impact of such products on the environment, Nischal and Nikhil Sharma set up  Svenklas , a brand that makes luxury bags from sustainable materials, in 2017. With a total of 24 SKUs across six categories, the brand\u2019s flagship products are its unisex backpacks. Svenklas, which manufactures its products in Gurugram and Noida, claims to ensure sustainability across its supply chain, including clean energy-powered manufacturing and fair wages to workers. The startup currently sells all its products online via its website and other ecommerce channels. Svenklas recently launched its offline stores in Delhi and Mumbai and stepped outside India by opening a distribution channel in the Middle East. As of now, Svenklas has set its eyes on introducing new products, keeping its female audience in mind, while its long-term plans include expanding to the Southeast Asian market. While India has not yet implemented comprehensive regulations governing cryptocurrencies, it did bring crypto transactions under taxation in July 2022. Founded in December 2022 by Avinash Shekhar, Singapore-based  TaxNodes  is a crypto tax startup that aims to simplify crypto profitability assessment, taxation, and reporting in India. TaxNodes streamlines the tax computation process for both retail investors and cryptocurrency exchanges.

Furthermore, TaxNodes offers solutions to government regulators, empowering them to ensure tax and regulatory compliance among crypto users and exchanges through audit tools. Obtaining a tourist visa can be cumbersome and time-consuming, especially for individuals unfamiliar with the requirements. The extensive documentation and long wait times can disrupt travel plans. Nikita Dresswala encountered these challenges during her three-week cycling journey across Southeast Asia. Her experiences, coupled with her visa application struggles, led her to establish  Teleport  in 2022. Today, the startup streamlines the visa application process for travellers by offering automated flows, guided steps, and data-driven decisions to maximise visa approval rates.\u00a0 Teleport provides tourist visas for over 40 countries, including popular destinations like France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Malaysia, and more.

Per the European Environment Agency, the logistics industry is one of the largest contributors to carbon emissions in the world, accounting for nearly  25% of the total global annual emissions . Experts opine that these numbers may rise to as much as 40% if corrective actions are not taken. Access to sustainable mobility for businesses remains patchy, especially in India, which contributes to the ecological damage.\u00a0 Chartered accountants and childhood friends Aditya Singh Ratnu and Dhruv Bhatia have first-hand experience in solving this problem even before they founded  ZEVO  in 2022. Their research on the electric mobility segment showed that the ecosystem lacked a suite of products and services that address sustainable mobility and micro-warehousing challenges. As ecommerce fulfilment trends move towards same-day delivery and quick commerce, companies require sustainable solutions that address micro-warehousing (smaller delivery hubs) and last-mile logistics needs.\u00a0 ZEVO\u2019s core products include electric vehicle mobility as a service (EVaaS), micro-warehousing as a service (MWaaS), temperature-controlled refrigerated delivery, refrigerated micro-warehousing and agricultural supply chain electrification. The startup enables integrated same-day fulfilment on a demand or subscription basis. Businesses can book EVs for various purposes such as deliveries, transporting goods, as well as forward and reverse logistics for both refrigerated and non-refrigerated products. The startup is currently operational in Delhi-NCR, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Pune and Mumbai. In the short term, the startup is working to expand its electric fleet and geographic reach to 3,000 EVs and 16 cities, respectively. [Edited by Shishir Parasher]",

        "Article Content": "New-age tech stocks suffered a heavy dent amid a crash in the broader market at the beginning of the week due to a rout in global equities markets. Eighteen of the 25 new-age tech stocks under Inc42\u2019s coverage declined in a range of 0.21% to just under 8% this week.\u00a0 Recently listed travel tech startup ixigo emerged as the biggest loser this week, plummeting 7.59% to end at INR 163.20. Paytm, Nazara Technologies, Go Digit, MapmyIndia were among the other prominent losers.\u00a0 Amid all these, seven new-age tech stocks gained in a range of over 1% to just under 7%. Fino Payments Bank  continued its rally  this week as well to emerge as the biggest gainer. The payments bank\u2019s shares zoomed 6.85%. The week began with a turmoil in the global markets. Most Asian markets slumped on Monday (August 5) due to rising tensions in the Middle East,\u00a0 weak US economic data spurring concerns on recession, tightening of monetary policy in Japan, among other reasons.\u00a0 As a result, benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty50 slumped 2.74% and 2.68%, respectively, on Monday. The India volatility index (VIX) jumped 42% to 20 levels, which, as per analysts, indicates a fear among investors of an economic slowdown. The sell-off on Monday  wiped out over $2 Bn  from the market capitalisation of new-age tech companies.\u00a0 While the indices  managed to recover  some of the losses in the subsequent sessions, they still ended the week in the red. While Sensex declined 1.5% to end the week at 79,705.91, Nifty 50 slumped 1.4% to close at 24,367.50.\u00a0 Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, said that this recovery came after the Bank of Japan (BoJ) said that it would not raise interest rates during periods of financial instability.\u00a0 \u201cThe Indian market experienced a marginal recovery from the uncertainties stemming from concerns about the unwinding of carry trades\u2026 While the carry trade issue appears to have eased for now, a gradual increase in interest rates by the BoJ could have some impact in the near future,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said that the markets are likely to consolidate at higher levels due to mixed global cues and absence of any major domestic triggers. \u201cOver the past few days, Nifty has been volatile with some recovery seen in the last few days. India VIX descended from a level of around 20 to 15 during the week, showing easing cautiousness in the market and improvement in sentiments,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Analysts believe that new-age tech stocks will see stock-specific action in the coming week, with some of the companies slated to report their Q1 numbers. Amid the market turmoil, electric two-wheeler manufacturer Ola Electric became the first automobile manufacturer to get listed on Indian bourses in nearly two decades. Meanwhile, two other startups, FirstCry and Unicommerce, are set to list on the exchanges in the first half of next week.\u00a0 Overall, the total market capitalisation of the 26 new-age tech stocks, including Ola Electric, under Inc42\u2019s coverage stood at $72.05 Bn at the end of this week. In comparison, the market capitalisation of 25 new-age tech stocks stood at $67.91 Bn last week.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the performance of new age tech stocks this week.\u00a0 The shares of the EV maker listed on Friday (August 9)  flat at INR 75.99  on the BSE against its IPO issue price of INR 76. However, the stock  rose 20%  during the day to close at INR 91.18 apiece.\u00a0 It is pertinent to note that the company made its public market debut with a valuation of $4 Bn, 25% lower than its last private valuation of $5.4 Bn. After the jump in the share price on the first day, the startup\u2019s market cap stood at about $4.79 Bn.\u00a0 Commenting on the company\u2019s listing, Geojit\u2019s Nair said that the market debut defied grey market expectations of a 4-5% discount. \u201cThe positive performance can be attributed to its healthy long-term outlook, 38% market share in two-wheeler EVs, benefits from the PLI scheme, and advantages of vertical integration,\u201d he added.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Prashanth Tapse, senior VP of research at Mehta Equities, highlighted the short-term risks for the company.\u00a0 \u201cPost listing, the short-term view remains the same due to weak financials and risk of negative cash flows in future. The allotted investors should understand the risks, which could adversely impact its consolidated financial condition post listing. Considering all the factors, we advise only risk-taking investors to continue to hold with a minimum holding period of 2-3 years,\u201d he said.\u00a0 It is pertinent to note that Ola Electric continues to be a loss-making entity. In the financial year 2023-24 (FY24), its net loss widened 7.6% to INR 1,584.4 Cr from INR 1,472.1 Cr in the previous year. However, operating revenue jumped over 90% to INR 5,009.8 Cr during the year under review from INR 2,630.9 Cr in FY23. As of now, all eyes will be on the company\u2019s Q1 financial results, scheduled to be announced next week. \u00a0 PB Fintech, the parent of Policybazaar, reported  a net profit of INR 59.98 Cr  in Q1 FY25 this week as against a loss of INR 11.9 Cr in the year-ago quarter. While its core online business, which includes Policybazaar and Paisabazaar, grew 29% year-on-year (YoY) to INR 665 Cr, the new initiatives arm saw its revenue jump 131% YoY to INR 346 Cr.\u00a0 A day after it reported its results, shares of PB Fintech touched  an all-time high  of INR 1,664.35 on Wednesday (August 7). However, the stock declined in the subsequent sessions to end 2.93% lower week-on-week at INR 1,452.30.\u00a0 The decline can be majorly attributed to the bearish view of brokerages on the stock. Kotak Institutional Equities downgraded its rating on the stock from \u2018add\u2019 to \u2018reduce\u2019 post the financial disclosure, saying that the price leaves little room for business vagaries.\u00a0\u00a0 Brokerage Nuvama increased its revenue estimates for PB Fintech but lowered margin expectations.\u00a0 Honasa Consumer Ltd, the parent company of D2C brand Mamaearth, reported a  62.9% increase in profit after tax (PAT)  to INR 40.2 Cr in Q1 FY25 from INR 24.7 Cr in the same quarter last year. Honasa continued to reap the benefits of its \u2018house of brands\u2019 strategy this quarter. It currently operates six brands \u2013 Mamaearth, Auqalogica, The Derma Co, Dr Sheth\u2019s, BBlunt, and the recently-launched colour cosmetics brand Staze. The company noted that its product business increased 20.3%, driven by a volume growth of 25.2% in Q1 FY25. It is pertinent to mention that brokerages have been bullish on Honasa\u2019s house of brands approach in the past. Earlier in July, Emkay gave the company a price target of INR 525 by June 2025.\u00a0 \u201cOur ground checks suggest faster scale up of new brands like The Derma Co and Aqualogica. We foresee a distribution shift in the top-50 towns aiding the Mamaearth brand, where repeats are ensuring. We expect enhanced profitability in hero SKUs, where Honasa is likely to reduce trade margin, given healthy repeats,\u201d it said. The company\u2019s chairman and CEO Varun Alagh said that Honasa has captured a strong market share in the face wash category online while steadily gaining ground offline, \u201cdriven by its house of brands strategy and innovation capabilities\u201d. However, the company said it has  discontinued its ayurvedic beauty products brand Ayuga . It cited the failure to establish a product-market fit (PMF) as the reason behind it.\u00a0 Shares of Honasa ended this week 4.31% higher, despite falling 4.6% on Friday to INR 473.35 ahead of the earnings announcement.",
