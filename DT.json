        "Article Content": "The first every DT Channel Survey 2024, which provides a thorough analysis of the challenges and opportunities facing India's channel partner community, reveals that while channel partners generally view the existing frameworks\u2014such as rewards distribution, sales training, and supply chain management\u2014as effective, there is a clear need for targeted improvements. Conducted to understand the pulse of channel partners across the country, the survey also brings to the fore opportunities that can help enhance transparency in incentive programs, handle price parity concerns, tailor training to specific needs, and address critical supply chain challenges. Recognizing the pivotal role that the Indian IT channel fraternity plays in driving the adoption and expansion of IT products, this first ever DT Channel Survey aims to uncover the key dynamics at play in an evolving technology landscape, where emerging technologies such as Cloud, AI, IoT, and Blockchain are becoming increasingly central. Focusing on the domestic IT market, the DT Channel Survey 2024 highlights critical challenges and opportunities for channel partners. India's domestic IT market is currently valued at approximately $54 billion, according to Statista, with the hardware segment contributing around $14 billion and the software and services sector accounting for about $40 billion. This market is experiencing steady growth, fueled by the country's rapid digital transformation. The survey identifies several challenges that have emerged in the post-pandemic era: : Ransomware attacks, data breaches, climatic changes, and geopolitical issues have led to stock shortages and delays in fulfilling orders, significantly impacting channel operations. : The pandemic has accelerated the demand for collaboration tools, cybersecurity for remote access, and home office equipment. This shift has forced channel partners to adapt quickly to new market demands. : The economic environment, characterized by inflation and rising interest rates, has made it difficult for channel partners to extend credit and close deals, putting pressure on their financial stability. : There is an increased focus on digital transformation and cost optimization. Channel partners must stay ahead of technological trends to meet the evolving needs of their customers effectively. : The growth of online marketplaces and direct sales by vendors has intensified competition, requiring channel partners to innovate and adapt to maintain their market position. When asked, \"How do channel partners rate the quality of products and solutions provided by vendors and brands?\" the response was overwhelmingly positive. Nearly 80% of channel partners in India expressed satisfaction with the quality they receive. Interestingly, a significant portion of partners from tier 2 and tier 3 cities were notably more inclined to recognize the superior quality of products provided by the vendors they worked with. This confidence stems from the consistent reliability and innovation that these technology brands and vendors deliver. The high standards of quality and the robust support offered by vendors enable channel partners to effectively meet their clients' needs. Additionally, the strategic partnerships forged between vendors and channel partners grant access to cutting-edge technologies, giving them a competitive advantage in the market. This mutual trust and collaboration not only strengthen business relationships but also contribute to successful outcomes for both parties. In response to the question, \"Do brands maintain price parity between online and offline channels?\" nearly 66% of channel partners reported that price parity is not consistently maintained. This disparity poses significant challenges for offline retailers, especially during special occasions such as festivals, when consumers often perceive online prices as more competitive. These differences in pricing can disrupt market dynamics, influencing consumer behavior in favor of online purchases and potentially impacting the sales and loyalty of brick-and-mortar stores. The lack of price parity not only creates an uneven playing field but also affects the overall trust and relationship between brands and their offline channel partners. Addressing this issue is essential to ensuring fair competition and sustaining the viability of both online and offline retail channels. In response to the question, \"How would you rate the vendor/brand\u2019s customer service support?\" nearly 89% of technology channel partners rated it as 'Good,' with only 11% rating it as 'Average.' This overwhelmingly positive feedback underscores vendors' strong commitment to customer service excellence. Effective customer service is a critical factor in channel partner satisfaction, ensuring smooth operations, quick issue resolution, and strengthened trust between partners and vendors. The high ratings indicate that vendors are not only responsive and supportive but also proactive in addressing the needs of their partners. This level of support is crucial for maintaining strong, long-term partnerships, enabling channel partners to deliver exceptional service to their end customers, which in turn bolsters brand loyalty and market competitiveness. However, the 11% 'Average' rating, though relatively small, highlights areas where improvement is needed. A continued focus on enhancing customer service can further elevate the overall partner experience, ensuring even greater satisfaction and success. In response to the question, \"What time does it take for products to be delivered after placing the order with brands or national distributors?\" the feedback reveals significant variations in delivery times. These inconsistencies can be attributed to several factors, including the efficiency of the brand's logistics network, regional distribution capabilities, and the specific types of products being shipped. While some channel partners report prompt delivery, others experience delays that can disrupt their ability to meet customer expectations and manage inventory effectively. These variations highlight the critical need for a robust and reliable supply chain. Timely product delivery is essential for maintaining customer satisfaction and ensuring operational efficiency. Brands that consistently deliver products on time not only strengthen their relationships with channel partners but also build trust and foster loyalty. Conversely, inconsistencies in delivery times can lead to frustration and potentially damage the brand's reputation. To address these issues, it is crucial for brands to optimize their logistics processes, enhance communication, and increase transparency with their partners. In response to the question, \"How fair do you believe the distribution of rewards is within the current incentive programs?\" nearly 88% of channel partners rated the distribution as 'fair.' This strong majority indicates that most channel partners view the incentive programs as equitable and balanced. Fair distribution of rewards is crucial for maintaining motivation and engagement among channel partners, as it ensures that their efforts and contributions are appropriately recognized and compensated. However, while the 'fair' rating reflects a generally positive sentiment, it also suggests there is room for improvement. An ideal incentive program not only motivates channel partners but also clearly communicates the criteria for rewards, ensuring transparency and consistency. The 12% of partners who did not find the distribution fully fair might be facing challenges related to unclear reward criteria, perceived biases, or inconsistencies in reward distribution across different regions or partner levels. To address these concerns, brands should consider refining their incentive structures, enhancing communication, and ensuring greater transparency. By doing so, they can strengthen partner relationships and foster a more competitive and motivated channel ecosystem. Regularly assessing and adjusting the fairness of incentive programs will help align them with partner expectations, contributing to a more productive and satisfied channel network. In response to the question, \"How effective do you find the sales training sessions in improving your product knowledge and sales techniques?\" 66% of channel partners rated the training as 'effective.' This indicates that the majority of partners view the training sessions as beneficial for enhancing their understanding of products and refining their sales techniques. Effective sales training is crucial for empowering channel partners, equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to better represent the brand, address customer inquiries, and close sales. However, with 34% of partners possibly finding room for improvement, there is a clear need for vendors and brands to re-evaluate and tailor their training content to specific contexts and partner needs. To further enhance the effectiveness of sales training sessions, brands could consider implementing more customized and interactive training modules, providing hands-on experiences, and offering continuous learning opportunities. Additionally, gathering detailed feedback from participants and regularly updating training content to reflect the latest product developments and market trends will ensure that the training remains relevant and impactful. By addressing these areas, brands can maximize the value of their training programs, leading to better-equipped channel partners and ultimately driving improved sales performance. When asked, \"What are the biggest challenges you face in your supply chain?\" channel partners identified several critical issues:  This emerged as the most commonly reported challenge, with nearly half of the partners significantly affected by the costs associated with transporting goods. High logistics expenses can erode profit margins and diminish the overall competitiveness of products. Factors such as fluctuating fuel prices, complex shipping routes, and the need for specialized transportation for certain products may exacerbate this issue. To alleviate these burdens, brands and channel partners could explore more efficient logistics strategies, partnerships with logistics providers, or alternative shipping methods.  A third of respondents expressed concerns about the risks of relying heavily on a limited number of suppliers. This dependence can create vulnerabilities, such as supply disruptions due to unforeseen events or imbalances in bargaining power. To mitigate these risks, channel partners and brands should consider diversifying their supplier base, developing contingency plans, and establishing stronger relationships with existing suppliers to ensure a more consistent and reliable supply chain. : These challenges highlight the importance of efficient inventory management and reliable delivery schedules. Limited product availability can lead to lost sales opportunities and dissatisfied customers, while delays in delivery can disrupt business operations and reduce customer satisfaction. To address these issues, improving inventory forecasting, investing in technology to enhance supply chain visibility, and working closely with suppliers to streamline production and delivery processes are essential steps. By identifying and addressing these specific challenges, brands and channel partners can enhance supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and improve their ability to meet customer demand promptly and reliably. When asked, \"How have global supply chain disruptions impacted your business?\" channel partners identified several critical challenges: : A third of respondents reported substantial cost increases due to global supply chain disruptions. These escalations can be attributed to various factors, including higher raw material prices, increased shipping and logistics expenses, and additional tariffs or import/export restrictions. The rising costs can strain profit margins, forcing businesses to adjust their pricing strategies, which may affect their market competitiveness.  Another third of channel partners indicated challenges in fulfilling customer demand, a situation that can have serious repercussions on business performance and customer satisfaction. Disruptions may cause delays in production and delivery, resulting in missed sales opportunities and potential loss of customer loyalty.  Though less commonly reported, frequent product shortages still pose a significant concern. These shortages can disrupt business operations and limit product availability for customers, potentially leading to lost sales and a negative perception of the brand. To address these shortages, companies may need to improve demand forecasting, secure alternative suppliers, and enhance communication with their supply chain partners to proactively anticipate and mitigate potential disruptions. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes cost management, enhancing supply chain resilience, and refining demand forecasting and inventory strategies. By taking these steps, businesses can better navigate the complexities of the current global supply chain landscape, maintaining their competitiveness and ensuring customer satisfaction. When asked, \"What factors do you consider when choosing a vendor?\" channel partners identified three primary considerations: : Nearly half of the channel partners indicated that price and cost competitiveness is the most critical factor when selecting a vendor. This focus highlights the importance of financial viability in business partnerships, as competitive pricing directly influences profitability and market positioning. Vendors that offer competitive pricing are often more attractive to channel partners, helping them maintain a strong market presence.  A third of respondents prioritize product quality and reliability in their vendor selection process. This suggests that vendors who uphold rigorous quality control standards and consistently provide reliable products are more likely to be chosen as partners. Such products contribute to a stable and positive market presence, minimizing the risk of product failures or customer dissatisfaction.  About one-fifth of channel partners consider the reputation and history of a vendor to be a significant factor. This involves evaluating the vendor's track record, market standing, and overall credibility. A strong reputation often signals a vendor's reliability, ethical business practices, and commitment to delivering on promises. Channel partners tend to favor vendors with a proven history of stability, excellent customer service, and responsiveness to issues. These attributes are crucial for establishing long-term, trust-based partnerships that can withstand market fluctuations and challenges. It is important to note that a vendor's ability to provide high-quality, competitively priced products, combined with a solid reputation, plays a significant role in channel partners' decision-making processes. These factors are essential in shaping the success and sustainability of business relationships. 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  : : Invest in upskilling your workforce to stay ahead in these rapidly evolving fields. Develop specialized teams or units focused on these technologies to serve clients with cutting-edge solutions, thus positioning your company as a leader in innovation. : Explore these additional emerging technologies to provide comprehensive solutions, particularly in industries that are increasingly relying on data-driven insights and secure, transparent transactions. Go beyond product sales by offering end-to-end services. This could include customized training programs for clients, ongoing support, and managed services that help clients optimize their IT infrastructure and operations. These services not only increase revenue streams but also strengthen client relationships. Offer consulting services to help clients develop and implement technology strategies that align with their business goals, further positioning your company as a trusted advisor. Adopt advanced digital tools and platforms to reach a wider audience, improve customer engagement, and streamline operations. Incorporate AI-driven marketing tools to personalize customer experiences and improve conversion rates. Develop an omnichannel approach that integrates online and offline customer touchpoints, ensuring a seamless experience across all channels. Tailor your offerings to meet the specific needs of each client. Focus on building long-term relationships through consistent, high-quality service and by acting as a reliable partner in your clients' growth and success. Regularly check in with clients to understand their evolving needs and offer proactive solutions before issues arise. Conduct market research to identify underserved niches with specific needs that align with your expertise. Develop specialized solutions or services that cater specifically to these markets, establishing your company as a leader in these areas. Offer highly customized solutions that are flexible enough to adapt to the unique requirements of niche markets. Actively seek out new partnerships and collaborations with other industry players, including technology vendors, startups, and research institutions. These collaborations can lead to innovative solutions and open up new market opportunities. Join or form industry alliances to stay ahead of trends, influence industry standards, and gain access to a broader network of potential partners and clients. Establish systems to regularly collect and analyze customer feedback. Use this feedback to continuously improve your offerings, ensuring that they meet the highest standards of quality and relevance. Develop the ability to quickly adapt to changes in the market, whether they stem from technological advancements, shifts in customer preferences, or economic factors. This agility will enable you to remain competitive and responsive to client needs. Integrate sustainability into your operations and product offerings. Promote energy-efficient, environmentally-friendly solutions and practices that appeal to increasingly eco-conscious consumers. Engage in CSR activities that reflect your company\u2019s values and contribute to the community. This not only enhances your brand image but also strengthens relationships with clients who value responsible business practices. By incorporating these strategies, channel partners can not only enhance their current operations but also position themselves for long-term success in an increasingly complex and competitive market. The DT Channel Survey 2024 underscores the importance of agility and innovation for channel partners in navigating the post-pandemic landscape. By understanding and addressing these challenges, the channel fraternity can capitalize on emerging opportunities and drive growth in the domestic IT market. The findings and insights from this survey are a step further in laying the foundation for their growth and helping them form strategies to withstand the market headwinds. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "To ensure cyber security for the country, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah has proclaimed several new initiatives. As part of the program, the ministry has decided to train 5,000 cyber commandos\u2019, establish a web-based data registry, and introduce a portal to report cybercrime information. The Home Minister was addressing the first Foundation Day commemoration of I4C (Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre) on Tuesday, in New Delhi. During his address, Shah also announced the foundation of CFMC (Cyber Fraud Mitigation Centre) in attendance with major banks, payment aggregators, financial intermediaries, IT intermediaries, telecom service providers, law enforcement agencies from Union and state territories, and others. Under the CFMC, all agencies are tasked with collaborating to ensure prompt action against online financial crimes, exemplifying the concept of \u201ccooperative federalism\u201d in law enforcement. The Home Minister also confirmed that the joint venture of seven cyber coordination teams has delivered satisfactory results in Mewat, Ahmedabad, Jamtara, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Guwahati, and Visakhapatnam. Along with that, the cyber media initiative CyberDost under I4C has successfully executed an awareness campaign on multiple social media handles. Shah advocates the necessity of a precise strategy to move together in the direction to achieve the goal. The Samanvay Platform, a Joint Cybercrime Investigation Facilitation System, represents a significant step forward. This web-based module will act as a centralized portal, serving as a core repository for cybercrime data and facilitating data sharing, analytics, crime mapping, and enhanced cooperation and coordination. 'The Cyber Commandos' program is a specialized team of trained personnel established in states and UTs and CBI-like central police organizations to address cybersecurity threats. These trained cyber commandos are anticipated to support both central and state agencies in safeguarding the digital landscape. A registry of suspects is being developed based on the NCRP (National Cybercrime Reporting Portal), which is collaborating with financial intermediaries and banks to boost fraud risk management potential in India\u2019s financial ecosystem. The Union Home Minister also noted that India commutes 46% of digital transactions across the globe which underscores the increase in internet users from 250M on March 31, 2014- 950M on March 31, 2024. He also pointed out that data consumption has surged nearly 78-fold to 20.27 GB from 0.26 GB, driven by increased download speeds and reduced costs.Top of Form Also, he highlighted that the Digital India initiative has brought many services online, with digital transactions amounting to \u20b920.64 lakh crore in 2024. So far, the I4C has issued more than 600 advisories and blocked social media pages, websites, accounts, and mobile apps utilized by cybercriminals. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

With this new feature in the\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0QX20, users have more freedom to be creative when it comes to preserving their precious\u00a0photo\u00a0memories. The\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0QX20\u00a0comes in a stylish design with three colour options - Sand White, Dark Grey, and Terracotta Red. Weighing less than a 500ml bottle of water and being palm-sized, the\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0QX20\u00a0fits easily into an everyday bag for fun printing on the go. Once paired with a smart device via the\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0Photo\u00a0Layout app, users can edit, decorate, and adjust the layout of their\u00a0photos\u00a0or even create collages before printing. Two different sticker paper formats are supported, offering possibilities such as creating labels, art projects and scrapbooks, or even souvenirs for a gathering that can be distributed immediately to all. Like the\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0QX10 and CP1500, prints by the\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0QX20\u00a0promise beautiful colours and smooth gradations with the dye-sublimation thermal transfer method, where ink film is heated until it vaporises into gas. Sharper, clearer images can be achieved via a new clarity-focused sharpness processing method. Users can go minimalistic and simple with the images solely, or allow their artistic side take charge with the customisable layout and decorative options. With 35 different stamps, 25 frames, up to 7 overlays, as well as text and paint functions, users will find it convenient and easy to produce unique creations! Each print has a special protective laminate that protects it against external elements such as water, dirt and even fingerprints, as well as prevents colour bleeding and fading. The prints can even be used as\u00a0photo\u00a0stickers to mark drinks at events. If stored\u00a0in an album, they will last up to 100 years leaving one\u2019s future generations with intimate records of their family history. The decorated images\u00a0created with the mobile app can also be saved to cloud storage, making it easy for sharing with friends and family. The\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0QX20\u00a0has been improved to keep up better with fast-paced demands of modern life: it takes around 40 seconds \u00a0to print and is fully charged in approximately 80 minutes via a USB Type-C cable, a significant improvement from its predecessor. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Huawei Technologies unveiled its latest $2,800 tri-fold smartphone on Tuesday, aiming to strengthen its position in the world\u2019s largest smartphone market and draw attention away from Apple, just hours after Apple's latest iPhone 16 launch. The Chinese technology company exhibited the latest Mate XT, a three-way foldable handset such as an accordion screen door, in the Shenzhen tech hub launch ceremony. The smartphone has already received over 4 million pre-orders that required no deposit, as per the company\u2019s website. According to research organization IDC, the entire global market for foldable phones, in the second quarter, was around 4 million units. \"Today we bring you a product that everyone can think of but could not make. Our team has been working hard for five years and has never given up,\" Richard Yu, Huawei executive director stated at the launch. \"Today we will once again rewrite the history of the industry, turn science fiction into reality, and lead a new era of folding devices.\" AI functions are bolstered with in-house Kylin chips of Huawei, he added. The new phone features an AI assistant alongside translation, text summary, and editing functions, along with AI-boosted image editing capabilities such as removing unwanted parts from the photos, Yu said. The highly anticipated launch follows right hours after Apple\u00a0introduced its latest lineup - the AI-supported iPhone 16, both smartphones are due to up on sale on 20  September. The Mate XT is available in red and black colours and boasts a 10.2-inch display screen. The company claims that its 3.6mm width makes it the slimmest foldable phone in the world and also has a keyboard attached easy to fit in the pocket. The 256-gigabyte model is priced at 19,999 yuan, with higher memory options available at 21,999 yuan and 23,999 yuan, as per Reuters. The launch, following a string of successful smartphone releases, highlights Huawei's resilience in overcoming U.S. sanctions and strengthens its position over Apple in China, where consumers have criticized the iPhone 16 for lacking AI features. Apple is still in search of an AI partner in China to enhance its iPhone 16 series, while its AI software, Apple Intelligence, will not be available in Chinese languages until next year. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

And both devices will also be able to use Recording Summary which will take an hour long meeting recording and turn it into a short written summary in a matter of seconds, as well as producing a transcript.\u00a0 But with OnePlus, AI isn\u2019t just on the surface. OnePlus Nord 4 and OnePlus Pad 2 also have AI baked right into their operating system, OnePlus\u2019s beloved OxygenOS. OxygenOS 14, shipping on the two products, features machine learning systems built into its RAM, storage and CPU as well as at the heart of its battery. \u00a0OnePlus Nord 4 and OnePlus Pad 2 both feature OnePlus\u2019s self developed Trinity Engine, which helps ensure you get the best day to day performance from your product. It studies your phone\u2019s CPU, RAM and ROM and make sure they\u2019re operating to the best of their ability. It\u2019s like having an AI librarian in your phone\u2019s memory, keeping everything stored neatly, and an AI personal trainer in its processor to help achieve high performance without high levels of stress. \u00a0Meanwhile OnePlus Nord 4 will also feature Battery Health Engine, designed to keep its battery at peak fitness. Battery Health Engine uses AI technology to analyse everything from the amount of power going into the phone to the time it reaches 100% charge. And thanks to Battery Health Engine, OnePlus Nord 4\u2019s battery has been tested to survive more than 1,600 charging cycles, over four years of use, with over 80% of its original capacity. That\u2019s more than three times what you\u2019ll find elsewhere. OnePlus will unveil the final details about OnePlus Nord 4 and OnePlus Pad 2 at its Summer Launch event, taking place in Milan, Italy, on 16 July. As well as these products, OnePlus will also unveil the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro and the OnePlus Watch 2R. The event will be streamed live on OnePlus's YouTube channel. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

This is a testament to realme's extreme pursuit of design aesthetics, and the brand\u2019s commitment to bringing young consumers products with classic and timeless design. A result of realme\u2019s partnership with\u00a0 \u00a0the realme 13 Pro Series 5G features meticulously crafted designs inspired by Monet's \"Haystacks\" and \"Water Lilies.\" Available in two stunning variations, each with its own unique aesthetic, where\u00a0 \u00a0is inspired by Monet's golden haystacks under sunlight, where the hues radiate warmth and tranquility; the\u00a0 reflects the serene beauty of blooming water lilies, which embodies elegance and vitality.\u00a0 Monet's dedication to capturing the ephemeral nature of light and shadow is legendary - he created 25 paintings of \"Grainstacks\" and an astounding 250 paintings of \"Water Lilies\" throughout his lifetime. His goal was to capture the same scenes at different times of the day and across various seasons, preserving fleeting moments in timeless art.

The first stage involves measuring, using a high speed camera, how long a smartphone takes to carry out a range of every day tasks. Then the phone is subjected to a range of demanding tests including copying huge files to its memory and fragmenting it, creating thousands of photos, sound files and movies, and creating more than 15,000 text messages and installing more than 180 apps. \u00a0 Finally, the time taken for the now aged phone to perform the same basic functions and use the same popular apps is checked. Only if a phone can do this in an acceptable amount of time can it achieve a fluency A rating, and the OnePlus Nord 4 is the only phone to achieve a 72 month rating. \u00a0 \u00a0 As well as having software designed to last longer than ever, OnePlus Nord 4 also features OnePlus's Battery Health Engine technology to ensure it continues to charge effectively for years too, certified for 1,600 complete charging cycles. \u00a0 This technology, designed by OnePlus, uses AI to analyze your battery use and charging habits. It then optimises everything from the amount of power going in to the time your phone reaches 100% power. All in the name of keeping your battery running as sweetly as your phone\u2019s software. \u00a0 \u00a0 The OnePlus Summer Launch event will take place in Milan, Italy, on 16 July As well as the OnePlus Nord 4 smartphone, OnePlus will also unveil the OnePlus Pad 2 tablet, the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro and the OnePlus Watch 2R.

Although it is the fourth consecutive quarter of YoY shipment growth, muted consumer demand and rising ASPs continue to restrict swift annual recovery. \u201cThe latter half of the second quarter is a prelude to the crucial second half of the year with festive sale period going up till November. Apart from old inventory clearance in the first half of the quarter, vendors also started to launch new smartphones, especially in the mid-premium/premium segment (mostly China-based vendors) from mid-quarter onwards, for monsoon sales in July and August,\u201d said Smartphone ASPs (average selling price) grew by 2.8% YoY; however, they declined QoQ by 5.6%, at US$248. The entry-level (sub-US$100) segment witnessed a strong decline of 36% YoY to 14% share, down from 22% a year ago. Xiaomi continued to lead this space, followed by Poco and realme. Shipments to the mass budget (US$100<US$200) segment grew by 8% YoY, with a marginal increase in share to 44% from 42%. The top 3 brands were Xiaomi, realme and vivo, making up 60% of this segment.

The iPhone15/15 Plus/14/14 Plus together accounted for 77% of shipments, followed by the Galaxy S24/S24 Ultra with an 11% share. Overall, Apple led the segment with a share of 83%, followed by Samsung at 16%. 27 million 5G smartphones were shipped in the quarter, the share of 5G smartphone shipments increased to 77%, up from 49% in 2Q23, while 5G smartphone ASPs declined by 22% YoY to US$293.

Overall, vivo continued to lead for the second consecutive quarter, with multiple launches across price segments through the Y series, mid-premium V series and flagship X Fold 3 Pro. Motorola registered the highest growth backed by product portfolio across price segments, while Nothing witnessed the second-highest growth amongst all other brands. \u201cThe premiumization trend in the smartphone market, led by Apple and Samsung, coupled with rising device costs is motivating China-based brands to expand beyond the mass segment.

        "Article Content": "Innovative technology brand TECNO today teased its groundbreaking PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2 \u2013 an ultra-thin tri-fold concept smartphone that reimagines the large-screen experience in a pocket-sized device. In its folded form, PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2 is the thinnest among existing triple-folding models, measuring just 11mm in thickness. Unfolded, it reveals a giant 10\u201d screen with TDDI technology for the first time in a foldable device. The new concept offers a glimpse into a more immersive, convenient and exciting future foldable smartphone experience. Building on previous designs, it addresses key pain points like hinge durability, camera performance, and software optimization, marking a significant leap forward in foldable innovation. PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2\u2019s innovative tri-fold screen transforms the device from a standard candy bar smartphone into an incredible tablet-like large-screen device. Crucially, the tri-fold design does not mean a major compromise on thickness, measuring 11mm when folded, thanks to an innovative and thinner hinge that enables existing bi-fold models to achieve a thickness of less than 9mm. The device features the smartphone industry\u2019s thinnest battery cover measuring just 0.25mm thanks to super compressed Titan Advanced Fiber material. Compared to the industry\u2019s current thinnest 0.45mm thickness, this advanced material brings sufficient strength while allowing a thinner form.\u00a0 The streamline camera design also contributes to thinness and lightness without sacrificing image quality, while its position to one side of the device makes it easier to find the center of gravity when holding. Unfolding from a 6.48\u201d candy bar phone into an impressive 10\u201d 4:3 ratio large-screen tablet-style device, PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2 gives users more flexibility to users to use the device as they wish. To support this upgrade in convenience, the device features OLED Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) and an advanced 3K LTPO screen with 392 PPI. Empowering the tri-fold screen experience is a state-of-the-art hinge design with incredible 2100MPa strength. The hinges can support over 300,000 folds, exceeding most folding devices and offering exceptional device longevity and folding smoothness. The hinges also contribute to the device\u2019s superbly flat screen, minimizing the crease visibility for more immersive viewing pleasure. PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2 supports screen hovering to open up new possibilities across a diverse range of scenarios, from work to entertainment and daily life. For example, screen hovering with the base of the screen used flat for typing on a keyboard while the upright screen provides a laptop-style display for convenient notetaking in meetings or university lectures. For communicating across language barriers, the device can be folded into tent mode for dual-screen face-to-face real-time AI translation. For everyday browsing, the foldable screen supports multi-window mode to improve efficiency, letting users stay in their game or movie while responding to messages or searching the internet. And for more inventive imagine, users can explore creative unfolded angles enabled by the tri-fold design. PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2\u2019s advanced software and UI specifically optimized for the tri-fold design further enhance the utility of its cutting-edge hardware. For example, the device supports dynamic wallpapers and adaptive icons that adjust with folding and unfolding, while the UI layout is adapted for diverse use cases such as large-screen viewing and tent mode, as well as having the potential for exciting third-party app adaption. PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2 is not the first innovative concept from PHANTOM, the premium technology sub-brand of TECNO that offers the most advanced and stylish technologies to users seeking the best experiences. Previously, the\u00a0PHANTOM Ultimate\u00a0rolling screen concept smartphone demonstrated the sub-brand\u2019s exceptional capabilities in advanced screen development.

        "Article Content": "As the calendar flips to 9  September, it marks the day of the highly anticipated iPhone 16 \u2018It\u2019s Glowtime' launch event. The industry has already started counting down and anticipating what new features are Apple going to introduce to its fans while rolling out the flagship iPhones from the previous year \u2013 the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The new iPhone is expected to look almost identical to its predecessor models. While there will be minor camera improvements and other feature upgrades, nothing drives consumers the upgrade like a changed design, as per the Bloomberg report. Watch the iPhone 16 launch here Apple\u2019s promise to introduce a suite of AI features under its trademark Apple Intelligence tool is going to steal the show at today\u2019s iPhone 16 launch event. Visibly, it appears that Apple users still have to wait for the best AI features for the reasons, that Apple Intelligence will take some more time to be fully baked and the initial version will drop ChatGPT to name a few of many features. The report further reveals that the company will not introduce Apple Intelligence even at the end of this month when the model will be up for sale and will most probably start unveiling along with iOS 18.1 software updates next month. Along with the summarization of notifications and web content, today\u2019s event introduces the tool to enhance writing and the ability to eliminate objects or people from images, reveals the report. Features like automated transcriptions of users\u2019 phone calls and prioritizing email on an important basis in the Apple Mail application will also be introduced. Also, the new iPhone 16 models will replace the Blue Titanium finish of the iPhone 15 Pro with the new Gold Titanium option. However, Natural, Black, and White Titanium colours will remain the same. the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus are anticipated to replace yellow with While and introductory shades of Pink, Green, and Blue. The Black color option is likely to remain unchanged from the iPhone 15 model. When it comes to cost, no reports or assumptions have been made by factors trying on the beta version or neither is a much-hyped factor in the media; however, like every year with the launch of the iPhone\u2019s new version the cost increases, sans no back button, or enhanced storage space on the phone worked out for the ease of Apple users.

        "Article Content": "The first every DT Channel Survey 2024, which provides a thorough analysis of the challenges and opportunities facing India's channel partner community, reveals that while channel partners generally view the existing frameworks\u2014such as rewards distribution, sales training, and supply chain management\u2014as effective, there is a clear need for targeted improvements. Conducted to understand the pulse of channel partners across the country, the survey also brings to the fore opportunities that can help enhance transparency in incentive programs, handle price parity concerns, tailor training to specific needs, and address critical supply chain challenges. Recognizing the pivotal role that the Indian IT channel fraternity plays in driving the adoption and expansion of IT products, this first ever DT Channel Survey aims to uncover the key dynamics at play in an evolving technology landscape, where emerging technologies such as Cloud, AI, IoT, and Blockchain are becoming increasingly central. Focusing on the domestic IT market, the DT Channel Survey 2024 highlights critical challenges and opportunities for channel partners. India's domestic IT market is currently valued at approximately $54 billion, according to Statista, with the hardware segment contributing around $14 billion and the software and services sector accounting for about $40 billion. This market is experiencing steady growth, fueled by the country's rapid digital transformation. The survey identifies several challenges that have emerged in the post-pandemic era: : Ransomware attacks, data breaches, climatic changes, and geopolitical issues have led to stock shortages and delays in fulfilling orders, significantly impacting channel operations. : The pandemic has accelerated the demand for collaboration tools, cybersecurity for remote access, and home office equipment. This shift has forced channel partners to adapt quickly to new market demands. : The economic environment, characterized by inflation and rising interest rates, has made it difficult for channel partners to extend credit and close deals, putting pressure on their financial stability. : There is an increased focus on digital transformation and cost optimization. Channel partners must stay ahead of technological trends to meet the evolving needs of their customers effectively. : The growth of online marketplaces and direct sales by vendors has intensified competition, requiring channel partners to innovate and adapt to maintain their market position. When asked, \"How do channel partners rate the quality of products and solutions provided by vendors and brands?\" the response was overwhelmingly positive. Nearly 80% of channel partners in India expressed satisfaction with the quality they receive. Interestingly, a significant portion of partners from tier 2 and tier 3 cities were notably more inclined to recognize the superior quality of products provided by the vendors they worked with. This confidence stems from the consistent reliability and innovation that these technology brands and vendors deliver. The high standards of quality and the robust support offered by vendors enable channel partners to effectively meet their clients' needs. Additionally, the strategic partnerships forged between vendors and channel partners grant access to cutting-edge technologies, giving them a competitive advantage in the market. This mutual trust and collaboration not only strengthen business relationships but also contribute to successful outcomes for both parties. In response to the question, \"Do brands maintain price parity between online and offline channels?\" nearly 66% of channel partners reported that price parity is not consistently maintained. This disparity poses significant challenges for offline retailers, especially during special occasions such as festivals, when consumers often perceive online prices as more competitive. These differences in pricing can disrupt market dynamics, influencing consumer behavior in favor of online purchases and potentially impacting the sales and loyalty of brick-and-mortar stores. The lack of price parity not only creates an uneven playing field but also affects the overall trust and relationship between brands and their offline channel partners. Addressing this issue is essential to ensuring fair competition and sustaining the viability of both online and offline retail channels. In response to the question, \"How would you rate the vendor/brand\u2019s customer service support?\" nearly 89% of technology channel partners rated it as 'Good,' with only 11% rating it as 'Average.' This overwhelmingly positive feedback underscores vendors' strong commitment to customer service excellence. Effective customer service is a critical factor in channel partner satisfaction, ensuring smooth operations, quick issue resolution, and strengthened trust between partners and vendors. The high ratings indicate that vendors are not only responsive and supportive but also proactive in addressing the needs of their partners. This level of support is crucial for maintaining strong, long-term partnerships, enabling channel partners to deliver exceptional service to their end customers, which in turn bolsters brand loyalty and market competitiveness. However, the 11% 'Average' rating, though relatively small, highlights areas where improvement is needed. A continued focus on enhancing customer service can further elevate the overall partner experience, ensuring even greater satisfaction and success. In response to the question, \"What time does it take for products to be delivered after placing the order with brands or national distributors?\" the feedback reveals significant variations in delivery times. These inconsistencies can be attributed to several factors, including the efficiency of the brand's logistics network, regional distribution capabilities, and the specific types of products being shipped. While some channel partners report prompt delivery, others experience delays that can disrupt their ability to meet customer expectations and manage inventory effectively. These variations highlight the critical need for a robust and reliable supply chain. Timely product delivery is essential for maintaining customer satisfaction and ensuring operational efficiency. Brands that consistently deliver products on time not only strengthen their relationships with channel partners but also build trust and foster loyalty. Conversely, inconsistencies in delivery times can lead to frustration and potentially damage the brand's reputation. To address these issues, it is crucial for brands to optimize their logistics processes, enhance communication, and increase transparency with their partners. In response to the question, \"How fair do you believe the distribution of rewards is within the current incentive programs?\" nearly 88% of channel partners rated the distribution as 'fair.' This strong majority indicates that most channel partners view the incentive programs as equitable and balanced. Fair distribution of rewards is crucial for maintaining motivation and engagement among channel partners, as it ensures that their efforts and contributions are appropriately recognized and compensated. However, while the 'fair' rating reflects a generally positive sentiment, it also suggests there is room for improvement. An ideal incentive program not only motivates channel partners but also clearly communicates the criteria for rewards, ensuring transparency and consistency. The 12% of partners who did not find the distribution fully fair might be facing challenges related to unclear reward criteria, perceived biases, or inconsistencies in reward distribution across different regions or partner levels. To address these concerns, brands should consider refining their incentive structures, enhancing communication, and ensuring greater transparency. By doing so, they can strengthen partner relationships and foster a more competitive and motivated channel ecosystem. Regularly assessing and adjusting the fairness of incentive programs will help align them with partner expectations, contributing to a more productive and satisfied channel network. In response to the question, \"How effective do you find the sales training sessions in improving your product knowledge and sales techniques?\" 66% of channel partners rated the training as 'effective.' This indicates that the majority of partners view the training sessions as beneficial for enhancing their understanding of products and refining their sales techniques. Effective sales training is crucial for empowering channel partners, equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to better represent the brand, address customer inquiries, and close sales. However, with 34% of partners possibly finding room for improvement, there is a clear need for vendors and brands to re-evaluate and tailor their training content to specific contexts and partner needs. To further enhance the effectiveness of sales training sessions, brands could consider implementing more customized and interactive training modules, providing hands-on experiences, and offering continuous learning opportunities. Additionally, gathering detailed feedback from participants and regularly updating training content to reflect the latest product developments and market trends will ensure that the training remains relevant and impactful. By addressing these areas, brands can maximize the value of their training programs, leading to better-equipped channel partners and ultimately driving improved sales performance. When asked, \"What are the biggest challenges you face in your supply chain?\" channel partners identified several critical issues:  This emerged as the most commonly reported challenge, with nearly half of the partners significantly affected by the costs associated with transporting goods. High logistics expenses can erode profit margins and diminish the overall competitiveness of products. Factors such as fluctuating fuel prices, complex shipping routes, and the need for specialized transportation for certain products may exacerbate this issue. To alleviate these burdens, brands and channel partners could explore more efficient logistics strategies, partnerships with logistics providers, or alternative shipping methods.  A third of respondents expressed concerns about the risks of relying heavily on a limited number of suppliers. This dependence can create vulnerabilities, such as supply disruptions due to unforeseen events or imbalances in bargaining power. To mitigate these risks, channel partners and brands should consider diversifying their supplier base, developing contingency plans, and establishing stronger relationships with existing suppliers to ensure a more consistent and reliable supply chain. : These challenges highlight the importance of efficient inventory management and reliable delivery schedules. Limited product availability can lead to lost sales opportunities and dissatisfied customers, while delays in delivery can disrupt business operations and reduce customer satisfaction. To address these issues, improving inventory forecasting, investing in technology to enhance supply chain visibility, and working closely with suppliers to streamline production and delivery processes are essential steps. By identifying and addressing these specific challenges, brands and channel partners can enhance supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and improve their ability to meet customer demand promptly and reliably. When asked, \"How have global supply chain disruptions impacted your business?\" channel partners identified several critical challenges: : A third of respondents reported substantial cost increases due to global supply chain disruptions. These escalations can be attributed to various factors, including higher raw material prices, increased shipping and logistics expenses, and additional tariffs or import/export restrictions. The rising costs can strain profit margins, forcing businesses to adjust their pricing strategies, which may affect their market competitiveness.  Another third of channel partners indicated challenges in fulfilling customer demand, a situation that can have serious repercussions on business performance and customer satisfaction. Disruptions may cause delays in production and delivery, resulting in missed sales opportunities and potential loss of customer loyalty.  Though less commonly reported, frequent product shortages still pose a significant concern. These shortages can disrupt business operations and limit product availability for customers, potentially leading to lost sales and a negative perception of the brand. To address these shortages, companies may need to improve demand forecasting, secure alternative suppliers, and enhance communication with their supply chain partners to proactively anticipate and mitigate potential disruptions. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes cost management, enhancing supply chain resilience, and refining demand forecasting and inventory strategies. By taking these steps, businesses can better navigate the complexities of the current global supply chain landscape, maintaining their competitiveness and ensuring customer satisfaction. When asked, \"What factors do you consider when choosing a vendor?\" channel partners identified three primary considerations: : Nearly half of the channel partners indicated that price and cost competitiveness is the most critical factor when selecting a vendor. This focus highlights the importance of financial viability in business partnerships, as competitive pricing directly influences profitability and market positioning. Vendors that offer competitive pricing are often more attractive to channel partners, helping them maintain a strong market presence.  A third of respondents prioritize product quality and reliability in their vendor selection process. This suggests that vendors who uphold rigorous quality control standards and consistently provide reliable products are more likely to be chosen as partners. Such products contribute to a stable and positive market presence, minimizing the risk of product failures or customer dissatisfaction.  About one-fifth of channel partners consider the reputation and history of a vendor to be a significant factor. This involves evaluating the vendor's track record, market standing, and overall credibility. A strong reputation often signals a vendor's reliability, ethical business practices, and commitment to delivering on promises. Channel partners tend to favor vendors with a proven history of stability, excellent customer service, and responsiveness to issues. These attributes are crucial for establishing long-term, trust-based partnerships that can withstand market fluctuations and challenges. It is important to note that a vendor's ability to provide high-quality, competitively priced products, combined with a solid reputation, plays a significant role in channel partners' decision-making processes. These factors are essential in shaping the success and sustainability of business relationships. 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  : : Invest in upskilling your workforce to stay ahead in these rapidly evolving fields.

By incorporating these strategies, channel partners can not only enhance their current operations but also position themselves for long-term success in an increasingly complex and competitive market. The DT Channel Survey 2024 underscores the importance of agility and innovation for channel partners in navigating the post-pandemic landscape. By understanding and addressing these challenges, the channel fraternity can capitalize on emerging opportunities and drive growth in the domestic IT market. The findings and insights from this survey are a step further in laying the foundation for their growth and helping them form strategies to withstand the market headwinds. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "As Apple prepares to launch the iPhone 16, cybercriminals are already exploiting the hype with scams targeting eager fans. Widely regarded as the most anticipated tech event of the year, the release has fans poised to acquire the latest high-tech gadget. However, Kaspersky researchers have discovered that threat actors are luring users with fake pre-orders, early-adopter offers, and bogus technical support\u2014all packaged in convincing websites that lead only to financial losses and disappointment. The new iPhone 16 is set to be unveiled during the \u201c \u201d event on Monday, September 9, 2024, with official invites for the event sent out in August. If tradition holds, the devices are expected to hit stores on Friday, September 20th. Anticipated enhancements include AI-powered capabilities, revamped hardware, larger screens, sleeker frames, and a range of new colors. Rumors surrounding the latest device began circulating over the summer, giving cybercriminals an early warning. As the event approaches, researchers at Kaspersky have discovered fraudulent activity surrounding the launch. One common scam used by the threat actors offers early adopters the chance to pre-order the latest iPhone with a nearly 40% discount. Victims are directed to a slick website showcasing shiny new iPhones, enticing them with the promise to \u201cbe among the first to enjoy cutting-edge technology.\u201d Once they click through, they're asked for their billing and shipping information, with the option to pay via PayPal. A fake invoice is generated upon clicking \u2018add to cart\u2019 or \u2018buy,\u2019 factoring in tax and shipping, and even offering \"free shipping\" for orders over $1,000\u2014how generous! Once the payment is submitted, victims soon realize the money has disappeared from their account, but no iPhone is delivered. Even more concerning, the fraudsters now possess their personal information, which can be sold on the dark web. Another scam found by Kaspersky\u2019s experts is an offer for iPhone technical support which would enable them to update their mobile device. The fake site, which is in Spanish, so presumably aimed at Latin American users, also purports to take them through to a page where they can report the phone\u2019s loss or theft, and another to help them find their device. Finally, at the bottom victims are also given the option to reach a repair service. In return, all the page asks is to sign in with your Apple ID (a page which is strangely in English). Although filling in just one credential might not seem significant, iPhone users understand that if someone steals your Apple ID, they essentially hold the keys to your digital kingdom. Fraudsters can access your personal details\u2014such as your name, email address, and more\u2014and sell them on the dark web. They can also infiltrate your iCloud account, gaining access to your photos, documents, and device backups. Even more concerning, they can make unauthorized purchases using your ID, view your account balance, and take money from your Apple Wallet. Worst of all, your device can be locked and held for ransom. \u201cAs with most new technological releases, the launch of the iPhone 16 has generated massive excitement. Cybercriminals are quick to exploit this hype, so it's precisely at times like these that consumers should be extra vigilant. When making new purchases, stick to official channels, be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true, and always verify URLs before sharing any personal information. Scammers are counting on eager fans letting their guard down, so vigilance is key,\u201d says  Stick to official channels: Only purchase or pre-order the iPhone 16 through official retailers like Apple's website or trusted partners. Avoid clicking on links from unfamiliar websites or promotional emails, no matter how attractive the deal. Be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true: Cybercriminals often lure people in with offers of huge discounts or early access. If an offer seems too good to be true\u2014such as a 40% discount or exclusive pre-order access\u2014it's likely a scam. Double-check URLs and email addresses: Scammers often create fake websites that look nearly identical to legitimate ones. Always verify that the URL starts with \"https://\" and matches the official Apple domain. Similarly, be cautious of emails from unofficial-looking addresses. Don\u2019t share personal information: Be wary of any website or email asking for sensitive information like your credit card details, personal identification numbers, or Apple ID password. Apple will never ask for this kind of information via unsolicited emails or links. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Safeguard your online accounts, especially those linked to payment methods, with 2FA. This extra layer of security makes it harder for scammers to access your personal information. Verify pre-order news: If you hear about a special offer or pre-order deal, confirm it on Apple\u2019s official website or news channels. Keep an eye on your device\u2019s activity and report suspicious transactions: If you receive a questionable email, report it to Apple or the appropriate authorities. Report questionable offers: If you come across a suspicious website or phishing email, report it to Apple. This can help protect other users from falling for a scam. Use a trusted security Solution: An automated security solution, like\u00a0Kaspersky Premium, will protect you from all known and unknown scams. Stay Informed: Stay current on common scams and cybersecurity best practices \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

A startup in the systems integration space, Abrari Gadjet Trading, has  achieved a remarkable milestone by transforming into a Rs100 crore turnover company within just half a decade.  Focusing heavily on the education sector, Abrari Gadjet closed three major projects last year, delivering complete IT solutions to: The trio behind this impressive growth\u2014Abhishek Kumar Rawat, Ravindra Kumar Pandey, and Ritesh Vishwakarma, the Founder-Directors of Abrari Gadjet\u2014shared their journey from inception to success. \"We started in February 2019, and within five years, we've reached the  Rs 100 crore turnover mark.

        "Article Content": "Oracle announced the availability of\u00a0Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Zero Trust Packet Routing\u00a0which is built into the network fabric of\u00a0Oracle Cloud Infrastructure\u00a0(OCI). This helps to curtail any unauthorized access to data by separating network security from the underlying architecture. Based on the 2023 initiative to develop a new open standard with\u00a0Applied Invention\u00a0and other organizations, OCI Zero Trust Packet Routing enables organizations to set security attributes on resources and write natural language policies that limit network traffic based on the resources and data services accessed. As a result, organizations can safeguard themselves from one of the most common causes of compromise\u2014network misconfigurations. OCI is the first cloud provider to implement Zero Trust Packet Routing (ZPR) into its platform. \u201cAs public clouds emerged, enterprises had the opportunity to redefine how they address network security,\u201d said  . \u201cHowever, they carried over most of the same concepts that tightly coupled security and network configuration. A single mistake in a highly complex cloud network can result in exposure. OCI Zero Trust Packet Routing enables organizations to decouple network configuration from security, helping to eliminate the effects of human network configuration errors. This new standard driven by Oracle flips this all too often checkbox item on its head to provide an innovative solution for organizations that simplifies compliance efforts, reduces the burden on security teams, and ultimately strengthens security.\u201d \u201cTraditional security tools try to protect sensitive data by blocking access, but history shows it is almost impossible to anticipate all the ways a hacker might attempt to infiltrate a network,\u201d said  . \u201cWith Zero Trust Packet Routing, the network does not allow any data to move through the network without explicit permission. Organizations using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure can now take advantage of this to better safeguard their data. Oracle is the first to offer this new level of security, and we\u2019re hopeful other cloud platforms will follow.\u201d The new ZPR standard was needed as an organization\u2019s network architecture changes each time an application is launched, a new instance is scaled up, or additional database servers are added. Using a traditional network architecture-based security approach is time-consuming due to the sheer complexity of securing and auditing the configuration points. In addition, responsibility is transferred to network teams to implement security requirements, which can result in human error. OCI Zero Trust Packet Routing helps address these challenges by separating network security from network architecture and enabling organizations to write security policies to enforce security intent at the network layer. This means traffic not explicitly allowed by policy will be restricted at the network level. As a result, organizations can: Improve security posture:\u00a0Security teams can restrict access to sensitive data to a specific path, such as request origination host, network segment, or target data service. This helps reduce the attack surface area and safeguard against data exfiltration based on compromised credentials alone. Streamline compliance:\u00a0Security teams can quickly and easily prove to auditors that the necessary security controls are in place to meet compliance requirements by limiting access to a single, authorized path with natural language policies. Simplify security management:\u00a0Security teams can restrict access to sensitive data based on security attributes. Once a security attribute is set on data, security controls are automatically enforced based on the policies in place. This minimizes the need to deploy network-layer security rules based on characteristics such as IP addresses and ports. \u201cThough cloud network security has evolved over the last two decades, organizations are still increasingly vulnerable to unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data due to security controls heavily reliant on user credentials,\u201d said  . \u201cOCI Zero Trust Packet Routing enables organizations to set security attributes on specific resources and\u00a0then\u00a0blocks traffic to those resources at the network level, making\u00a0data security easier to understand, manage, and audit.\u00a0It\u00a0changes the paradigm of security in the cloud to protect organizations from malicious actors and the business-altering consequences of data breaches.\u201d \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Nvidia\u00a0shares slipped down 9.5% on Tuesday, marking the largest single-day market value loss ever for a US firm, as investors are more inclined towards practical implementation of Artificial Intelligence, leading to a widespread selloff in the market after disappointing economic data. Nvidia's market value dropped by $279 billion, signalling that investors are growing more cautious about the emerging AI technology that has led to this year's stock market gains. The PHLX chip index plunged 7.75%, marking its largest single-day decline since 2020, reported Reuters. The latest concerns about AI emerged after Nvidia showcased its quarterly forecast last Wednesday fell short of the set expectations by investors, who had fuelled a sharp rally in its stock. \"Such a massive amount of money has gone to tech and semiconductors in the last 12 months that the trade is completely skewed,\" stated Todd Sohn, the ETF strategist, Strategas Securities. Some recent research has questioned if the revenues from AI alone will eventually justify this wave of capital spending on it. When assessing AI capex by individual companies, investors must consider if they are making the best use of their balance sheets and capital,\" BlackRock strategists elaborated, on Tuesday in a client note. At its peak in July, Nvidia had nearly tripled in value in 2024. Despite recent losses, the stock remains up 118% for the year. This week, investors will receive a range of labour market data, leading up to the crucial government payrolls report on Friday. \"There\u2019s concern about what the job numbers are going to show, about seasonality,\" reveals Steve Sosnick, market strategist, Interactive Brokers. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Tenable\u00ae has released a research report titled   that identifies the key exposure points within organisations and outlines actionable steps to mitigate potential cyber threats that could endanger business operations. Over the past two decades, Tenable has collected and analysed approximately 50 trillion data points related to over 240,000 vulnerabilities. From this extensive dataset, Tenable developed a methodology revealing that only 3% of these vulnerabilities frequently result in significant exposure risks. With cybersecurity teams overwhelmed by vast amounts of fragmented threat intelligence and vulnerability data, Tenable conducted this study to help these teams shift toward a proactive defence strategy, focusing on eliminating the most dangerous threats. The study leveraged the Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) model, which Tenable developed to reflect the current threat landscape. VPR values range from 0.1 to 10, with higher values indicating a greater likelihood of exploitation. Vulnerabilities with a VPR above 9.0 are likely to be exploited if exposed, making them high-priority targets. In contrast, those with VPRs between 7.0 and 8.9 present a moderate risk, while medium and low categories (0.1 to 6.9) are less likely to be exploited. For example, on June 2, 2024, the study analysed nearly 240,000 vulnerabilities and found that only 3.1% of them\u2014fewer than 7,500\u2014were classified as Critical or High.\u00a0 \"Context matters. Without the right context, cybersecurity teams will always be in reactive mode, trying to fix every single vulnerability, making it impossible to keep all systems updated and secure,\u201d said  . \u201cOrganisations have relied on the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) for a long time, which doesn\u2019t offer a holistic picture of cyber risks and exposures. A proactive and preventive defence strategy requires exposure management, and a new metric to measure risk offering security professionals the much-needed context on which vulnerabilities and risk exposures to focus on,\" he added. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "The California Senate recently passed SB-1047, a bill aimed at preventing potential \"critical harms\" associated with large AI models before they occur. This legislation, which is now awaiting approval from Governor Gavin Newsom, mandates that companies developing AI models implement stringent safety protocols to prevent catastrophic outcomes. Specifically, the bill addresses the risks posed by AI models that could be used to create weapons capable of causing mass casualties, classifying these scenarios under the category of \"critical harms.\" The bill applies to the largest AI models that leverage 10^26 FLOPS, (floating point operations which is a way to measure computation) and cost a minimum of $100 million during training. Companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google meet this requirement. As per the bill, the original developer is accountable until the next developer spends $10 million to create its derivative. In addition, it advocates for a safety protocol that includes an \u201cemergency stop\u201d tab to close the entire model at the time of crisis. Developers are required to create testing procedures addressing risks caused by AI models, and mandatorily hire third-party auditors for annual assessment of safety practices. The newly formed California agency named the Board of Frontier Models for overseeing the rules. A written certification will be mandatory for all public AI models meeting the metrics of its protocol. A total of nine members will be governing The Board of Frontier Models which includes members from the AI industry, open, and source fraternity, and academia elected by California\u2019s legislature and governor. The board will be liable for advising California\u2019s attorney general about the possible breach of SB 1047. The CTO (chief technology officer) of the developer must report an annual certification revealing the condition of the AI model for potential risks and other compliances. In case of any \u201cAI safety incident,\u201d the developers are directed to send an acknowledgment to FMD under 72 hours of the incident. If the directives are not met, the developers have to stop training the model. In case the company is found indulged in a catastrophic event, the attorney general of California reserves all rights to sue the company. For the cost of the training model worth $100 million, penalties are up to $10 million at first and $30 million with subsequent violations. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "In response to the evolving needs of the digital industry, the Indian government is considering a revision of its 2020 data centre policy draft. According to ET CIO, data centres could soon be awarded infrastructure status, similar to other critical sectors like railways, roads, power, and ports. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is reportedly planning to offer enhanced incentives for companies looking to establish cutting-edge machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres. These incentives would support the development of larger and more cohesive frameworks within shared locations, reflecting the growing significance of ML and AI in the tech landscape. \u201cThe current cumulative capacity of all data centers pan India is roughly 950 megawatts (MW) and there is an opportunity to double this in the next two-three years. We estimate that the investment opportunity in data centres is likely to touch roughly $6 billion to $7 billion by 2026,\u201d as quoted by a government official to ET CIO. As per the new policy, the states are incentivized to provide dedicated zones to set up data centre parks, so that the companies can handle the costs affiliated with capital, power, and operational expenses. \u201cWe will also start talking to the power ministry on the options for uninterrupted power supply and whether these data centers can be allowed to draw power from other states or the open market instead of the state or union territory they are domiciled in,\u201d said the resource. \u201cOne option is to incentivise the states or the data centre parks themselves to set up captive power generation units.\u201d Notably, in 2020, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) introduced a Data Centre Policy that aimed to streamline the entry of new players into the sector by proposing a single-window clearance process. Additionally, the policy suggested incentives for companies that used domestically manufactured IT hardware, including storage, servers, and network devices. This draft was made available for public discussion. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Kaspersky statistics show that phishing continues to be a popular type of cyber-attack and continues to grow globally. Big celebrations and festivals are the times when the consumers are most vulnerable to phishing as scammers take advantage of the spending spree that most consumers get into during the time. Even as Indian consumers get ready to welcome Lord Ganesha and celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi, the cybercrooks are ready to scam them with phishing attacks. Kaspersky reports show that with the onset of festival season, cybercrooks get ready to steal identities, money or illegally take control of user accounts and profiles through phishing. According to Kaspersky statistics, phishing remains a globally and extremely popular type of attack. In particular, during the first six months of 2024, Kaspersky\u2019s Anti-Phishing system alone thwarted 515 million of attempts to follow phishing links. In comparison, Kaspersky\u2019 recent report,\u00a0Spam and Phishing 2023\u00a0revealed that 709 million phishing attempts were detected throughout the entire year of 2023. This shows that the pervasive nature of phishing attacks is continuing to spread, and slowly the same is evolving into something more complex. In fact, technologies like built-in GPT chats have enabled cybercriminals new ways to exploit the consumers. Kaspersky experts have found that messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram are being exploited in a big way by scammers to snare users into sharing their details. Interestingly, India has the highest number of WhatsApp users and as of May 2024, there are over 500 million monthly users in the country. Moreover, it is seen that 66% of users have made some kind of purchase after connecting with a brand via WhatsApp. This numbers increase during special occasions like Ganesh Chaturthi, when buying happens for gifting and the likes. \u201cPhishing remains a prevalent threat in today's digital landscape, constantly evolving to deceive unsuspecting users and the nature phishing is also changing. Our statistics show that there is a significant increase in hybrid phishing emails where a mix of spear phishing and traditional phishing is being used. Cybercriminals are also leveraging AI powered tools to create convincing contents, making these mixed attacks more effective and harder to detect. So, there is a critical need for cybersecurity solutions for consumers that provide not just protection from virus, but also from malware and phishing attempts. We have a comprehensive line of anti-phishing solutions for home users that offer the highest level of protection against phishing,\u201d says  Kaspersky\u2019s award-winning range of cyber security for home users include Kaspersky Premium, Kaspersky Plus and Kaspersky Standard. Recently Kaspersky Premium for Windows was\u00a0awarded as one of the best anti-virus and anti-phishing solutions\u00a0by the independent cybersecurity lab AV-Comparatives. This solution demonstrated the highest protection rate, detecting 93% of phishing URLs without a single false positive. \u25cf \u00a0Avoid opening link in emails claiming suspicious login attempts on an account. Avoid opening emails that claim that your account\u2019s billing or payment information is wrong, or an account needs to be confirmed. Be suspicious of content that seems odd even though seemingly from a legitimate sender. Check with the sender via an alternative means of communication. \u25cf \u00a0Be alert and learn to identify potentially malicious messages and actively remove them so that you do not fall victim to the scam. \u25cf \u00a0Try connecting with the company from whose URL you may have received the email or text. Let them know about the phishing attempts being made. This can protect other people from potentially becoming phishing victims, and also allows any other companies that may have been implicated in the scam to enhance their security measures and alert their customers. \u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0In case any malware has been used for the phishing attack, disconnecting the compromised device from the internet is the best way to stop the malware threat through home or office network. Disable the device\u2019s Wi-Fi connection, or completely disconnect and reset the Wi-Fi network to be on the safer side. \u25cf : Phishing scams manipulate victims into providing sensitive information. Usually, they will use a link to redirect users to a spoof website and get them to enter login credentials like passwords. After clicking a phishing link, it is best to change any password that might had been compromised in the attack.

        "Article Content": "In a strategic move to streamline its operations, the Bengaluru-based hyperlocal delivery platform Dunzo has announced a significant reduction in its workforce, affecting 75% of its employees. The decision comes in response to financial challenges, including delayed payments to employees and suppliers. According to a report by Financial Express, Dunzo has laid off 150 employees, which constitutes 75% of its total workforce. This action is part of the company\u2019s broader cost-cutting measures aimed at improving cash flow and addressing mounting liabilities, such as outstanding vendor payments and overdue employee salaries. Dunzo has assured affected employees that their pending salaries, leave encashments, severance, and other dues will be settled once the necessary funds are secured. Dunzo began as a concierge service, and has gone through multiple phases of ups and downs. At its height, the company earned a value of $775 million, but recently, it faced difficulties in securing a vital funding round. In May 2024, the company was nearing a deal to secure $22-25 million through a combination of equity and debt from investors. Unfortunately, the deal eventually fell apart. During July 2024, Dunzo notified its employees about the final stages of securing funds and anticipated clearing outstanding payments within 10-15 days. However, follow-up emails revealed ongoing delays as the promised funding did not materialize. Now the firm is continuously exploring ways to assort its revenue means beyond its main focus of merchant services, which is an essential move to navigate through this critical time for the organisation. With the significant layoff and reduced workforce, it is interesting to see how the company continues with its services to the customers. \u00a0 \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

The industry has already started counting down and anticipating what new features are Apple going to introduce to its fans while rolling out the flagship iPhones from the previous year \u2013 the iPhone 16, the iPhone 16 Plus, the iPhone 16 Pro, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The new iPhone is expected to look almost identical to its predecessor models. While there will be minor camera improvements and other feature upgrades, nothing drives consumers the upgrade like a changed design, as per the Bloomberg report. Watch the iPhone 16 launch here Apple\u2019s promise to introduce a suite of AI features under its trademark Apple Intelligence tool is going to steal the show at today\u2019s iPhone 16 launch event. Visibly, it appears that Apple users still have to wait for the best AI features for the reasons, that Apple Intelligence will take some more time to be fully baked and the initial version will drop ChatGPT to name a few of many features. The report further reveals that the company will not introduce Apple Intelligence even at the end of this month when the model will be up for sale and will most probably start unveiling along with iOS 18.1 software updates next month. Along with the summarization of notifications and web content, today\u2019s event introduces the tool to enhance writing and the ability to eliminate objects or people from images, reveals the report. Features like automated transcriptions of users\u2019 phone calls and prioritizing email on an important basis in the Apple Mail application will also be introduced. Also, the new iPhone 16 models will replace the Blue Titanium finish of the iPhone 15 Pro with the new Gold Titanium option. However, Natural, Black, and White Titanium colours will remain the same. the iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Plus are anticipated to replace yellow with While and introductory shades of Pink, Green, and Blue. The Black color option is likely to remain unchanged from the iPhone 15 model. When it comes to cost, no reports or assumptions have been made by factors trying on the beta version or neither is a much-hyped factor in the media; however, like every year with the launch of the iPhone\u2019s new version the cost increases, sans no back button, or enhanced storage space on the phone worked out for the ease of Apple users. After moderate usage users are compelled to opt for paid Cloud storage services; these are some baffled points that Apple could have fixed. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has called on the government to enforce stricter user privacy and traceability regulations on popular messaging and calling apps such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and Google Meet, as well as on telecom operators offering similar services via internet networks. COAI argues that these measures are essential to combat spam and illegal activities, as most messaging traffic has shifted from SMS to data networks. In response, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has issued a directive requiring telecom operators to enhance message traceability, with compliance mandated by November 1, 2024 COAI, which represents major telecom players like Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea, and Bharti Airtel, noted that these providers are actively collaborating with TRAI and other stakeholders to meet the new regulations. The primary concern is that over-the-top (OTT) communication services currently lack adequate regulatory and security measures. \"Traceability and user privacy are two benchmarks for this sector that the TSPs are striving to provide to ensure the security of the users, and the same should be applicable to OTT communication services as well,\" S P Kochhar, Director General of COAI, quoted to PTI. Several undesirable activities occurred on non-TSP networks, however, due to the lack of rules and security measures applicability reported violations hardly reach any accountability or closure. \"On one of the OTT platforms, 26,200 complaints were received for the period of June 1 to June 30, 2024. Out of these only 124 were resolved,\" said Kochhar. \"As against this, the consolidated revenue from SMS is just 0.12 per cent of the total revenues of TSPs. This also gives an indication that the data usage is heavily tilted towards OTT communication services. This is also borne out by the common observation that most of the cyber frauds through texting are taking place today through OTT platforms and are increasing steadily,\" continued he. \"Both are important but the supremacy should obviously go to 'national security'. Regulating OTT apps appropriately and under the same note as that of telecommunication services will certainly be a step in that direction,\" he stated. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

Later this year, Camera Control will unlock visual intelligence to help users learn about objects and places faster than ever before. Users can click and hold Camera Control to pull up the hours or ratings for a restaurant they pass, add an event from a flyer to their calendar, quickly identify a dog by breed, and more. The powerful new camera system helps users capture both everyday moments and cherished memories like never before. The 48MP Fusion camera enables a 2x optical-quality Telephoto option, which is like having two cameras in one, so users can get closer to the subject to easily frame a photo. In addition to wider-angle shots, the new 12MP Ultra Wide camera with autofocus enables macro photography. The Ultra Wide camera also gathers up to 2.6x more light for higher image quality. Powered by Apple Intelligence, users can search for specific photos in the Photos app using natural language, and search for specific moments in video clips.

        "Article Content": "Huawei Technologies unveiled its latest $2,800 tri-fold smartphone on Tuesday, aiming to strengthen its position in the world\u2019s largest smartphone market and draw attention away from Apple, just hours after Apple's latest iPhone 16 launch. The Chinese technology company exhibited the latest Mate XT, a three-way foldable handset such as an accordion screen door, in the Shenzhen tech hub launch ceremony. The smartphone has already received over 4 million pre-orders that required no deposit, as per the company\u2019s website. According to research organization IDC, the entire global market for foldable phones, in the second quarter, was around 4 million units. \"Today we bring you a product that everyone can think of but could not make. Our team has been working hard for five years and has never given up,\" Richard Yu, Huawei executive director stated at the launch. \"Today we will once again rewrite the history of the industry, turn science fiction into reality, and lead a new era of folding devices.\" AI functions are bolstered with in-house Kylin chips of Huawei, he added. The new phone features an AI assistant alongside translation, text summary, and editing functions, along with AI-boosted image editing capabilities such as removing unwanted parts from the photos, Yu said. The highly anticipated launch follows right hours after Apple\u00a0introduced its latest lineup - the AI-supported iPhone 16, both smartphones are due to up on sale on 20  September. The Mate XT is available in red and black colours and boasts a 10.2-inch display screen. The company claims that its 3.6mm width makes it the slimmest foldable phone in the world and also has a keyboard attached easy to fit in the pocket. The 256-gigabyte model is priced at 19,999 yuan, with higher memory options available at 21,999 yuan and 23,999 yuan, as per Reuters. The launch, following a string of successful smartphone releases, highlights Huawei's resilience in overcoming U.S. sanctions and strengthens its position over Apple in China, where consumers have criticized the iPhone 16 for lacking AI features. Apple is still in search of an AI partner in China to enhance its iPhone 16 series, while its AI software, Apple Intelligence, will not be available in Chinese languages until next year. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Innovative technology brand TECNO today teased its groundbreaking PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2 \u2013 an ultra-thin tri-fold concept smartphone that reimagines the large-screen experience in a pocket-sized device. In its folded form, PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2 is the thinnest among existing triple-folding models, measuring just 11mm in thickness. Unfolded, it reveals a giant 10\u201d screen with TDDI technology for the first time in a foldable device. The new concept offers a glimpse into a more immersive, convenient and exciting future foldable smartphone experience. Building on previous designs, it addresses key pain points like hinge durability, camera performance, and software optimization, marking a significant leap forward in foldable innovation. PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2\u2019s innovative tri-fold screen transforms the device from a standard candy bar smartphone into an incredible tablet-like large-screen device. Crucially, the tri-fold design does not mean a major compromise on thickness, measuring 11mm when folded, thanks to an innovative and thinner hinge that enables existing bi-fold models to achieve a thickness of less than 9mm. The device features the smartphone industry\u2019s thinnest battery cover measuring just 0.25mm thanks to super compressed Titan Advanced Fiber material. Compared to the industry\u2019s current thinnest 0.45mm thickness, this advanced material brings sufficient strength while allowing a thinner form.\u00a0 The streamline camera design also contributes to thinness and lightness without sacrificing image quality, while its position to one side of the device makes it easier to find the center of gravity when holding. Unfolding from a 6.48\u201d candy bar phone into an impressive 10\u201d 4:3 ratio large-screen tablet-style device, PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2 gives users more flexibility to users to use the device as they wish. To support this upgrade in convenience, the device features OLED Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) and an advanced 3K LTPO screen with 392 PPI. Empowering the tri-fold screen experience is a state-of-the-art hinge design with incredible 2100MPa strength. The hinges can support over 300,000 folds, exceeding most folding devices and offering exceptional device longevity and folding smoothness. The hinges also contribute to the device\u2019s superbly flat screen, minimizing the crease visibility for more immersive viewing pleasure. PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2 supports screen hovering to open up new possibilities across a diverse range of scenarios, from work to entertainment and daily life. For example, screen hovering with the base of the screen used flat for typing on a keyboard while the upright screen provides a laptop-style display for convenient notetaking in meetings or university lectures. For communicating across language barriers, the device can be folded into tent mode for dual-screen face-to-face real-time AI translation. For everyday browsing, the foldable screen supports multi-window mode to improve efficiency, letting users stay in their game or movie while responding to messages or searching the internet. And for more inventive imagine, users can explore creative unfolded angles enabled by the tri-fold design. PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2\u2019s advanced software and UI specifically optimized for the tri-fold design further enhance the utility of its cutting-edge hardware. For example, the device supports dynamic wallpapers and adaptive icons that adjust with folding and unfolding, while the UI layout is adapted for diverse use cases such as large-screen viewing and tent mode, as well as having the potential for exciting third-party app adaption. PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2 is not the first innovative concept from PHANTOM, the premium technology sub-brand of TECNO that offers the most advanced and stylish technologies to users seeking the best experiences. Previously, the\u00a0PHANTOM Ultimate\u00a0rolling screen concept smartphone demonstrated the sub-brand\u2019s exceptional capabilities in advanced screen development. The new PHANTOM ULTIMATE 2, with its groundbreaking tri-fold design, underscores TECNO\u2019s commitment to exploring and innovating the most advanced new technologies to revolutionize the user experience. The concept brings a new dimension to the relationship between users and their smartphones, creating exciting large-screen possibilities and ushering in a new future of advanced devices.

With this new feature in the\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0QX20, users have more freedom to be creative when it comes to preserving their precious\u00a0photo\u00a0memories. The\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0QX20\u00a0comes in a stylish design with three colour options - Sand White, Dark Grey, and Terracotta Red. Weighing less than a 500ml bottle of water and being palm-sized, the\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0QX20\u00a0fits easily into an everyday bag for fun printing on the go. Once paired with a smart device via the\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0Photo\u00a0Layout app, users can edit, decorate, and adjust the layout of their\u00a0photos\u00a0or even create collages before printing. Two different sticker paper formats are supported, offering possibilities such as creating labels, art projects and scrapbooks, or even souvenirs for a gathering that can be distributed immediately to all. Like the\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0QX10 and CP1500, prints by the\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0QX20\u00a0promise beautiful colours and smooth gradations with the dye-sublimation thermal transfer method, where ink film is heated until it vaporises into gas. Sharper, clearer images can be achieved via a new clarity-focused sharpness processing method. Users can go minimalistic and simple with the images solely, or allow their artistic side take charge with the customisable layout and decorative options. With 35 different stamps, 25 frames, up to 7 overlays, as well as text and paint functions, users will find it convenient and easy to produce unique creations! Each print has a special protective laminate that protects it against external elements such as water, dirt and even fingerprints, as well as prevents colour bleeding and fading. The prints can even be used as\u00a0photo\u00a0stickers to mark drinks at events. If stored\u00a0in an album, they will last up to 100 years leaving one\u2019s future generations with intimate records of their family history. The decorated images\u00a0created with the mobile app can also be saved to cloud storage, making it easy for sharing with friends and family. The\u00a0SELPHY\u00a0QX20\u00a0has been improved to keep up better with fast-paced demands of modern life: it takes around 40 seconds \u00a0to print and is fully charged in approximately 80 minutes via a USB Type-C cable, a significant improvement from its predecessor. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Canon announced the RF28-70mm F2.8 IS STM, a new RF mount lens for the EOS R mirrorless camera system that will take imaging possibilities into a new dimension. As a bright f/2.8 constant aperture standard zoom lens, the RF28-70mm F2.8 IS STM opens accessibility to more users, being Canon\u2019s first non-professional-grade lens of its kind.\u00a0 A constant aperture zoom lens is one of the most versatile types of lenses available. With its bright f/2.8 maximum aperture and compact, lightweight portability, the RF28-70mm F2.8 IS STM offers even more versatility. Users can freeze their precious moments in low light and achieve dreamy shallow focus (bokeh) effects, regardless if they are shooting glittery urban scenes at the 28mm wide end or taking close-up beauty shots at 70mm. When paired with APS-C cameras, it transforms into a standard zoom ideal for daily scenes, products, and portraits, with a full-frame equivalent effective focal range of 44.8mm to 112mm. The versatility is boosted with powerful built-in Optical Image Stabilizer, which helps users achieve sharp, steady images even when using shutter speeds up to 5.5 stops slower on cameras with no In-Body Image Stabilizer (In-Body IS) like the EOS R8, and up to 7.5 stops slower on cameras like the EOS R6 Mark II. Movie Digital IS during video shooting is also supported, allowing users to record smooth, steady handheld footage even without a tripod or gimbal. While the combination of a bright constant aperture with zoom capabilities is usually associated with larger professional-grade lenses, the RF28-70mm F2.8 IS STM dispels that notion. At approximately 9.22cm long when fully retracted and weighing approximately 495g, it is smaller and 45% lighter than its closest professional-grade counterpart (RF24-70mm f/2.8L IS USM), making it travel friendly. Despite not being an L-series lens, the RF28-70mm F2.8 IS STM boasts weather-sealing, the same level of durability and shock resistance, and an excellent image quality that far exceeds that of a kit lens, thanks to Canon\u2019s advanced optical design technology.\u00a0 \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

Through this strategic alliance, MSSPs will gain access to robust SAAS security solutions, including Unified Defense SIEM, UEBA, and SOAR capabilities. The aim is to address the growing needs of SMB and mid-market customers who face significant cyber risks daily due to increased digital and cloud adoption. These organizations often lack skilled manpower and have limited budgets to run in-house security operations effectively. In 2023, the average cost of recovering from a data breach was about INR 17.9 crores, according to a report released by a\u00a0Global MNC Technology Company. With the rapid advancement of AI and the rise of more sophisticated adversarial attacks, the costs are expected to rise even further. For SMBs and mid-market businesses with turnover between 50-250 crores, the financial impact of a data breach could\u00a0be devastating. As these businesses continue to digitize, the need for more robust cybersecurity measures is becoming increasingly urgent, and their willingness to invest in protection is growing. \u201cSecuronix is on a significant growth curve in India and is focused on further expanding its presence through channel partners to serve even more end customers,\u201d said\u00a0\u00a0 . \u201cUsing RAH Infotech's vast network and presence, we are looking forward to tapping tier 2 and tier 3 markets to help smaller organizations manage cyber risk better and ensure compliance at the same time.

        "Article Content": "Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) continues to grow in strength as a 5G use case for communications service providers (CSPs) globally with a sharp increase over the past year in the number of CSPs offering the service. The details, alongside Ericsson\u2019s latest mobile industry forecasts, regional breakdowns and customer case studies, feature in the June 2024 Ericsson Mobility Report. Of the CSPs sampled for the Ericsson study (310 globally), 241 offered FWA services as of April 2024. Of these, 128 - about 53 percent - included a 5G FWA offering. This is a twelve-point increase on the corresponding period in 2023 - a growth of 29 percent. The speed, data handling and low latency capabilities of 5G FWA also increase the attractiveness of speed-based FWA tariff plans to CSPs - with downlink and uplink data parameters - similar to cable or fiber offerings. This has helped to drive an almost 50 percent growth in the number of service providers offering 5G FWA speed-based tariffs in the past year - with 40 percent of all FWA CSPs now doing so. FWA is currently second only to enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) as a 5G use case. , says: \u201dThe June 2024 Ericsson Mobility Report shows continued strong uptake of 5G subscriptions. Enhanced Mobile Broadband and Fixed Wireless Access are the leading use cases, with signs that 5G capabilities are influencing service providers\u2019 Fixed Wireless Access offerings. The report also highlights the need for increased deployment of 5G Standalone technology to fully realize the potential of 5G.\u201d About 300 CSPs globally now offer 5G services, of which about 50 have launched 5G Standalone (5G SA). On subscriptions, 5G continues to grow in all regions. About 160 million 5G subscriptions were added globally in the first three months of 2024 - bringing the total to more than 1.7 billion. Almost 600 million new subscriptions are expected in 2024 as a whole. Researchers estimate that 5G subscriptions will be close to 5.6 billion by the end of 2029 - with global 5G population coverage beyond mainland China set to double from 40 percent at the end of 2023 to 80 percent by the end of 2029. 5G is expected to account for about 60 percent of all mobile subscriptions by the end of 2029. Regionally, North America is forecast to have the highest penetration by the end of 2029, with 90 percent (or 430 million) of subscriptions expected to be 5G. In India, 5G subscriptions are expected to grow from 119 million at the end of 2023 (about ten percent of all mobile subscriptions in the country) to about 840 million (65 percent of all subscriptions) by the end of 2029. On user experience, statistics from a leading service provider reveal 97 percent of all user activities on 5G mid-band achieved a time-to-content of less than 1.5 seconds, compared to 67 percent on 5G low-band and 38 percent on 4G (all bands). 5G mid-band population coverage outside of mainland China has reached 35 percent. North America and India have made rapid deployments, topping 85 and 90 percent mid-band coverage respectively. Year-on-year mobile network data traffic has been adjusted downwards by Ericsson Mobility Report researchers compared to the November 2023 report. This is due to changes in the underlying data, such as lower numbers reported by regulators and service providers in populous markets for the second half of 2023. Mobile network data traffic grew 25 percent year-on-year between the end of March 2023 and the end of March 2024, driven primarily by subscriber migration to later generations and data-intense services, such as video. Mobile data traffic is forecast to grow with a compound annual growth rate of about 20 percent through the end of 2029. About a quarter of all mobile network data was handled by 5G by the end of 2023. This is forecast to grow to about 75 percent by the end of 2029.

        "Author Name": "NDM News Network",
        "Author URL": "https://digitalterminal.in/author/ndm-news-network",
        "Article Content": "LAPP introduces its pioneering Single Pair Ethernet (SPE) portfolio. This comprehensive range marks a significant leap forward in the industrial automation landscape. \u00a0 The vision of a fully connected factory, inclusive of the Internet and the cloud, is becoming a reality. In the industrial landscape, two predominant systems have traditionally coexisted: Ethernet, a well-established communication standard at the control levels of the automation pyramid, and diverse fieldbus systems prevalent in the lower field levels. To facilitate\u00a0seamless networking, a new infrastructure was imperative. This infrastructure needed to align with the Ethernet networks at higher levels, all while being cost-effective and space-efficient, addressing the spatial constraints present in numerous\u00a0machines and systems.\u00a0 \u00a0 The solution lies in Single Pair Ethernet Technology (SPE), which facilitates\u00a0consistent and uniform Ethernet networking, extending all the way down to the field level, commonly referred to as the sensor/actuator level. It enables the real-time transmission of energy and substantial data volumes using only one data pair connection, deviating from the standard four data pairs found in typical Ethernet cables. The integration of artificial intelligence and big data allows for the optimization of production facilities. SPE stands out as an ideal solution for applications with limited space, providing\u00a0efficiency gains in weight and space utilization. This positions SPE as nearly as\u00a0fast as multi-pair Ethernet, while offering the advantage of covering significantly larger distances and requiring less installation effort.\u00a0 \u00a0 Since 2019, LAPP has collaborated with numerous\u00a0electrical connection companies, including cable and connector manufacturers, within the SPE Industrial Partner Network to drive the advancement of Single Pair Ethernet (SPE) technology. Over time, SPE has achieved international standardization, laying the groundwork for its global expansion. Several recommendations have been incorporated into the IEC 63171 standard for industrial connectors. LAPP favors the connector face specified in accordance with\u00a0IEC 63171-6 and actively contributes to the dissemination of this standard through its involvement with the SPE Industrial Partner Network. Additionally, corresponding guidelines for SPE networks have been developed by user organizations like PI for PROFINET or ODVA for ETHERNET/IP.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"In our view, the Single Pair Ethernet technology is a real game changer in industrial automation. This is why it was our aim to offer our customers SPE connection solutions from a single source\u00a0as quickly as possible. This saves time and professional advice is also available from our top-notch experts,\" explains\u00a0 . The world market leader for integrated solutions in the field of cable and connection technology started developing cables at an early stage. With the ETHERLINE \u00a0T1 product family, a portfolio of Single Pair Ethernet cables is available for use in industrial machines and systems. \u00a0 \u00a0 Another new product\u00a0available is\u00a0flexible, shielded SPE data cable ETHERLINE \u00a0T1 FLEX with PVC outer sheath, space-saving, single-pair cable design with UL approval. It is also available in dimension (26 AWG). In addition, there is the highly flexible SPE data cable ETHERLINE \u00a0T1 with PUR outer sheath and UL approval. It connects terminal devices at sensor/actuator level to the Industrial Ethernet \u2013 even in tight spaces. Its double shielding and PUR outer sheath, means the cable \u2013 which is suitable for use in cable chains \u2013 is well protected against external interference. The cable has been successfully tested on more than three million bending cycles. Both variants enable full interoperability of field devices and systems from different manufacturers by seamlessly connecting to the Industrial Ethernet network and are suitable for transmitting analogue and digital signals in the frequency range of up to 600 MHz and a distance of up\u00a0to 40 m. In addition, the Power-over-Data-Line (PoDL)-capable cables in accordance with\u00a0IEEE 802.3bu allow simultaneous power and data supply of SPE terminal devices with low energy requirements (up to 50 W). A double shielding made of aluminium-laminated foil and copper braiding with a high degree of coverage (SF/UTP) guarantees protection against electromagnetic interference.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 SPE has potential in many industries. In process automation, SPE helps bridge long distances in large-sized plants, for instance in the chemical industry. Analogue cables or fieldbuses with data transmission rates of just 31.25 kbit are still used here. For distances of up to 1000 metres, additional properties for the process industry have been defined for SPE under the term Ethernet APL (Advanced Physical Layer) based on 10BASE-T1L according to IEEE 802.3cg. LAPP Advanced Physical Layer (Ethernet-APL) is specifically designed for these demanding applications in the process industry, some of which are based on SPE. Ethernet APL enables safe data transmission up to field level in potentially explosive environments. This is ensured by the \"intrinsically safe\" ignition protection type. It is based on the 2-WISE concept (2-Wire Intrinsically Safe Ethernet) concept according to IEC TS 60079-47. This achieves an explosion-protection technology with a high level of protection. Ethernet APL also bridges long distances of up to 1000 m. The shielded Ethernet APL data cable ETHERLINE \u00a0TL and the flexible shielded Ethernet APL data cable ETHERLNE \u00a0TL FLEX for occasional movement enable data transmission via Ethernet up to the field level in potentially explosive environments in the process industry and are UL/CSA-certified for the North American region. The \"Fast Connect\" structure with inner sheath also enables easy stripping and assembly of the cable. Both variants are also among the first to be commercially available.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A further addition to the SPE portfolio is the compatible SPE connector EPIC \u00a0DATA SPE-6 FA M CS1 with crimp termination for AWG26 cables. This connection creates a vibration-proof connection, provides maximum contact protection between the contact and cable and is suitable for automated assembly. The SPE plug is suitable for creating a detachable SPE connection and is faster, easier and more cost-effective to install than a conventional Ethernet connector. The connector face complies with the DIN EN IEC 63171-6 standard. Its compact design enables use in tight spaces. Power over Data Line (PoDL)-capable connector can also be used for simultaneous power and data supply of SPE terminal devices with low energy requirements (up to 50 W). \u00a0 Suitable for this, there is the compact SPE circuit board socket EPIC \u00a0DATA SPE-6 PCB F for connecting SPE connectors to a printed circuit board inside active devices and a connector face in accordance with DIN EN IEC 63171-6. In addition to the data supply, the socket also enables a power supply of up to 50 watts for terminal devices thanks to the Power over Data Line. \u00a0 Last but not least, LAPP also possesses\u00a0the shielded single-pair Ethernet patch cable, shielded on both sides, for detachable SPE connections. Over moulded\u00a0connectors ensure it is held securely.\u00a0  \ud83d\udc49 ",

        "Article Content": "In today's digital landscape, data breaches continue to challenge businesses, particularly those in critical infrastructure sectors like telecommunications. Recently, Indian telecommunications company Airtel faced allegations of leaking data from its extensive 375 million customer base and selling it on the dark web for $50,000. Airtel has strongly denied these claims, assuring customers that their data is secure and asserting that the accusations are a desperate attempt to tarnish its reputation. This incident highlights the crucial need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive consumer information in an increasingly digital world. The telecom operator rubbishes all these reports claiming it false. The Airtel spokesperson told Digital Terminal that, \u201cThere has been an ongoing report alleging that Airtel customer data has been compromised. This is nothing short of a desperate attempt to tarnish Airtel\u2019s reputation by vested interests. We have done a thorough investigation and can confirm that there has been no breach whatsoever from Airtel systems.\u201d\u00a0 The news broke with a post from Dark Web Informer on social networking site X (previously Twitter), where the hacker identified himself as xenZen and claimed to have \u201c375 million Airtel India customers details including phone, email, address, parents name, gov ID (Aadhaar,etc.) updated to June 2024\u201d to put on sale on a BreachForums named community.  The details included mobile_number, Name, DateOfBirth, FatherName, LocalAddress, PermanentAddress, AlternateNo, EmailId, Gender, Nationality, ConnectionType, SIMActivationDate, Aadhar, PhotoIdProofDetaill, AddressProofDetails for sale priced as $50,000 in XMR. However, the hacker didn\u2019t reveal any customer data as the details are completely blurred and not visible on the screenshot page.\u00a0 Incidentally, the hacker also claimed to have sold the \"India Ministry of External Affairs Diplomatic Passport Holders Data.\" The dark web remains a restricted and largely uncharted territory for most internet users, inaccessible to the general public. Periodically, it surfaces with claims that can be devastating for countries and affected companies. However, the source of these claims is often unverified, and the identity of the person behind them is frequently unknown. Despite this, the government must take necessary actions against such false threats to maintain security and public trust. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "\"Go rural\" has become a pivotal slogan for marketing professionals, reflecting the rapidly evolving socio-economic trends in Tier 3, Tier 4, and rural areas. According to Nasscom, nearly 70% of the Indian population resides in rural areas and Tier 2, 3, and 4 cities. This demographic segment has become the prime target for consumer durable and non-durable products. There are numerous compelling reasons for market players to expand into rural markets. The digital transformation accelerated by COVID-19 has driven significant changes, akin to a decade's worth of progress. With the rise of mobile phones and increased access to Internet services, smaller towns have become more connected than ever. This shift has facilitated the rise of remote classrooms and home offices, creating a clear path for companies to deploy Wi-Fi and other digital services. Airtel Wi-Fi, which previously had limited availability, has addressed this issue by expanding its high-speed Wi-Fi services to over 1,200 cities. This development is a testament to the growing importance of rural markets in the digital age, providing a robust foundation for further economic and technological advancements. Gopal Vittal, CEO of Airtel, addressed Airtel customers in a letter detailing a significant new development. He wrote, \u201cWhile Airtel Wi-Fi has historically had limited availability, Airtel has worked towards solving this problem and now we have high-speed Wi-Fi available at present in 1200+ cities. This means that those of you who were unable to access high-speed internet will now be able to do so.\u201d At par with the firm\u2019s capability, Airtel informs its consumers about the offers available with its value packs. \u201cOffer the largest selection of TV shows, movies and web series which come included with your Wi-Fi plan. In specific, this content delivered through Airtel Wi-Fi will give you access to 22+ OTTs and 350+ TV channels. In addition, to signal our gratitude to you, every time you choose to add a new Airtel service - Mobile, Content, or Wi-Fi we will offer extra value over and above your basic plan,\u201d added Vittal.\u00a0 Another key factor driving companies to reconceptualize their products, services, distribution channels, and marketing strategies is the saturation point reached in metropolitan areas, where a wide range of brands and services are offered to the same set of consumers. In contrast, smaller cities are experiencing a rise in awareness but still face limited availability of options. However, expanding Wi-Fi services into Tier 3, Tier 4 cities, and rural areas presents several significant challenges. Many of these areas lack the basic infrastructure necessary to support high-speed internet, such as cell towers and fiber optic cables. Other obstacles include unreliable electricity, geographic difficulties, and financial constraints. The cost of establishing Wi-Fi infrastructure in less densely populated areas is higher, and the predominantly agriculture-based, low-income economies of these regions further complicate matters. In Tier 3, Tier 4 cities, and rural areas of India, the lower per capita income compared to Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities can limit the profitability of Wi-Fi service providers. As a result, companies operating in these areas often require government subsidies and incentives to thrive without significant obstacles. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "COAI\u2019s member Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have consistently invested in enhancing Quality of Service (QoS) through significant improvements in network infrastructure, resulting in greater stability and reliability. The industry has embraced advanced technologies and automation tools, including predictive maintenance and AI-driven analytics, to proactively address network issues. Moreover, major initiatives are underway to fiberize towers across India, which is a crucial step for the efficient deployment of 5G services. While TRAI has tightened the QoS benchmarks over the years, the ground realities remain unchanged. TSPs still grapple with Right of Way (RoW) issues when acquiring permissions for infrastructure deployment in public and private land for the installation of cell towers and fiber-optic cables. The situation is further aggravated due to additional requirement of street furniture for the 5G networks. Moreover, interference from various sources, such as other wireless devices and electromagnetic interference, degrade signal quality and network performance. Further, illegal boosters and repeaters used by unauthorised agents, as well as the cases of theft of equipment are also external factors which, nevertheless, impact the QoS. Besides, frequent takedown of the overhead fiber by the authorities have a significant impact in QoS as well. TSPs have limited control over these external sources which adversely impact the Quality of Services. Despite these challenges, TSPs have consistently met TRAI's QoS benchmarks. The industry expresses concern over the proposed regulations, which not only tighten benchmarks but also shift from quarterly to monthly reporting and site to cell level reporting in many cases. In fact, the QoS parameters prescribed in the new Regulations have not been introduced by any other regulator in other similar economies. These changes are expected to significantly increase the compliance as well as the cost burden on telecom operators, and without commensurate benefits for the customers. While we are disappointed with the stringency of these new regulations, we remain committed to engaging constructively with TRAI on QoS-related matters. Our member organizations will continue to strive for excellence in service quality\u00a0while advocating for regulations that recognize the practical challenges faced by our industry. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

Out of the 80%, the mix will include 33% 'Make' with Agile Methodology and projects, 25% 'Attempt' with hands-on coding practice on the CloudLabs platform, 13% 'Revise' with daily doubt resolution and progress review sessions, and 9% 'Test' with graded projects, presentations, and timed coding challenges. Over the past year, upGrad delivered over 200,000 hours of immersive learning through its active Bootcamp programs. The top three programs\u2014Full-Stack Development, Data Science with AI, and UI-UX- remained popular among early professionals and freshers who aimed to accelerate their career growth and stay competitive in the rapidly evolving tech industry. The majority of learners who signed up in FY24 belonged to the freshers' bracket followed by early professionals, demonstrating the effectiveness of our AI-ready content in advancing careers across different stages. With the portfolio now enhancing both tech and non-tech Bootcamps under the industry-first pedagogy, the company aims to double down on enrolments in FY25. Commenting on the development,\u00a0 \u00a0said,\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s a rising demand for AI-skilled talent across non-tech sectors such as retail, manufacturing, and even EV segments. As a result, hiring sentiments for jobs that require one to at least interact with GenAI tools - irrespective of the sector will continue to soar in the current FY. This demand necessitates more strategic skilling programs that equip young India with the most relevant and market-ready concepts.\u201d Designed to enhance employability, the Bootcamps will include more workshops and simulations, industry-aligned graded projects and case studies, and masterclasses. Learners will also benefit from triple certification from a government body, a global tech giant, and a university partner, ensuring holistic growth and academic alignment.\u00a0 \u201cGlobal slowdown in IT spending has had a countercyclical impact on upskilling among tech professionals in India. Especially students coming out of college or have just stepped into Corporate, have taken this opportunity to pursue fast-paced skilling programs and apply their knowledge in real-time at their jobs. Last year, we recorded one sign-up every 2 hours for our Bootcamps, fueling our commitment to enhance our offerings as we move forward continuously. Today, early coders, techies and even freshers are required to understand core fundamentals and new-age concepts to stay relevant. Hence, we have made a conscious call to enhance our portfolio with strategic GenAI training interventions to ensure market readiness,\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0added.\u00a0 \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Huawei Technologies unveiled its latest $2,800 tri-fold smartphone on Tuesday, aiming to strengthen its position in the world\u2019s largest smartphone market and draw attention away from Apple, just hours after Apple's latest iPhone 16 launch. The Chinese technology company exhibited the latest Mate XT, a three-way foldable handset such as an accordion screen door, in the Shenzhen tech hub launch ceremony. The smartphone has already received over 4 million pre-orders that required no deposit, as per the company\u2019s website. According to research organization IDC, the entire global market for foldable phones, in the second quarter, was around 4 million units. \"Today we bring you a product that everyone can think of but could not make. Our team has been working hard for five years and has never given up,\" Richard Yu, Huawei executive director stated at the launch. \"Today we will once again rewrite the history of the industry, turn science fiction into reality, and lead a new era of folding devices.\" AI functions are bolstered with in-house Kylin chips of Huawei, he added. The new phone features an AI assistant alongside translation, text summary, and editing functions, along with AI-boosted image editing capabilities such as removing unwanted parts from the photos, Yu said. The highly anticipated launch follows right hours after Apple\u00a0introduced its latest lineup - the AI-supported iPhone 16, both smartphones are due to up on sale on 20  September. The Mate XT is available in red and black colours and boasts a 10.2-inch display screen. The company claims that its 3.6mm width makes it the slimmest foldable phone in the world and also has a keyboard attached easy to fit in the pocket. The 256-gigabyte model is priced at 19,999 yuan, with higher memory options available at 21,999 yuan and 23,999 yuan, as per Reuters. The launch, following a string of successful smartphone releases, highlights Huawei's resilience in overcoming U.S. sanctions and strengthens its position over Apple in China, where consumers have criticized the iPhone 16 for lacking AI features. Apple is still in search of an AI partner in China to enhance its iPhone 16 series, while its AI software, Apple Intelligence, will not be available in Chinese languages until next year. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

Key Updates in Premiere Pro (Beta): Color Management The all-new Premiere color management combines all of this technology in a way that makes it easier to work with raw and log formats natively in Premiere Pro, so you always get a great starting point \u2014 you\u2019ll see great-looking footage as soon as clips are dropped into the timeline \u2014 without having to spend time adding LUTs. This automatic system normalizes raw and log media while taking advantage of all that data in the color pipeline for better control and beautiful images. An entirely new color management system that automatically transforms RAW and log footage from nearly every camera into great-looking SDR and HDR, so users can spend less time managing LUTs and start editing right away. A new wide gamut working color space that\u2019s vastly larger than Premiere\u2019s HD Rec.709 working space in which all image processing operations are performed. This new wide gamut color space leverages Hollywood\u2019s industry standard ACEScct with high-fidelity tone mapping that provides the kind of color and fidelity results that were previously impossible with Premiere Pro. Six simple \u201cset-it-and-forget-it\u201d presets in Sequence Settings and Lumetri color settings let users work in traditional Rec.709 for legacy projects or the new wide gamut color ACEScct with ease. Most-used effects, like Lumetri, are now color space aware with smoother and more flexible control for refining skin tones, balance, and creative looks when working in a wide-gamut preset. Consistent color and brightness when using Dynamic Link to send clips to and from\u00a0Adobe After Effects\u00a0for motion design and compositing Adobe is also introducing a new Properties panel that makes Premiere Pro easier to learn for beginners and makes video editing even faster for experienced professionals. With the Properties panel, editors can do things they\u2019ve never been able to do before in Premiere Pro, like crop video directly from the Program monitor, or highlight and adjust the properties of multiple clips or graphics at the same time. Consolidating the most frequently used tools in a single panel, along with the ability to directly manipulate (crop and reposition) images using on-screen controls, and the ability to batch process multiple clips at a time make this a game changer for anyone editing in Premiere Pro. It makes it easier for new users to learn the app, and more efficient for existing power users to work quickly. Adobe has been working hard at making Premiere Pro faster and more reliable for every job. With even more hardware acceleration, you\u2019ll have faster playback for codecs like AVC and HEVC. ProRes exports are now up to 3x faster so editors can deliver cuts to clients faster and get home earlier. Adobe also added format support for even more Canon, Sony, and RED cameras so users can import native files and start editing immediately. With two dark modes, a light mode, and high-contrast accessibility mode, editors can customize the look and feel of Premiere Pro. Users also get cleaner fonts and typography for better legibility and consistency with other\u00a0Adobe Creative Cloud\u00a0apps. That means less time spent re-learning how to use tools in different apps and more time creating. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "75% of enterprises will prioritize backup of software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications as a critical requirement, compared to 15% in 2024, according to Gartner, Inc. SaaS-based applications have become a preferred choice for new and modernized deployments, with the data these applications generate expected to be among the fastest-growing sets of critical enterprise data over the next five years. According to\u00a0Gartner\u2019s latest forecast, worldwide end-user SaaS spending is projected to grow 20% to total $247.2 billion in 2024, and is forecast to reach nearly $300 billion in 2025, \u201cThe risk of IT outages underscores the urgent need for regular backup and recovery of critical enterprise data,\u201d said\u00a0 . \u201cAs businesses are more dependent on SaaS technologies, it becomes crucial to ensure that SaaS data is both protected and recoverable. Given the vulnerability of SaaS data to errors, cyberattacks, and vendor mishaps, robust backup solutions are indispensable.\u201d \u201cIntegrating Backup as a Service (BaaS) is essential for safeguarding\u00a0cloud\u00a0workloads and maintaining operational continuity. Furthermore, enterprises must understand the shared data responsibility model of SaaS applications and evaluate their vendors\u2019 data protection measures. If these measures are inadequate, third-party solutions should be considered to guarantee comprehensive data protection,\u201d said Hoeck. Seventy-Five Percent of Large Enterprises Will Adopt BaaS Alongside On-Premises Tools by 2028 \u201cProtection and recovery of SaaS applications have often been a lower priority for many enterprises,\u201d said Hoeck. \u201cThis is due to confusion over the native SaaS vendor\u2019s responsibility for data protection, and the lack of industry-level standardization. Limited\u00a0API-based data access for protection and recovery from native SaaS vendors further complicates effective data protection, slowing support for third-party backup solutions.\u201d However, the SaaS\u00a0application\u00a0backup market is rapidly growing, initially led by specialized startups but now also includes established enterprise backup and recovery software solutions companies. Gartner predicts that by 2028, 75% of large enterprises will adopt BaaS alongside on-premises tools to back up cloud and on-premises workloads. To effectively safeguard SaaS-based application data, Gartner suggests that organizations focus on: Governance Assessment:\u00a0Include data protection and recovery capabilities in the\u00a0governance\u00a0assessment of SaaS applications. Vendor Capabilities:\u00a0Verify the SaaS vendor\u2019s ability to protect and recover data from all possible loss scenarios. Third-Party Solutions:\u00a0Use third-party SaaS backup solutions to complement the native capabilities of SaaS vendors.\u00a0These solutions can improve administration, centralize and orchestrate protection of multiple SaaS applications, simplify processes, and offer improved granular recovery capabilities. \u201cAs the market matures, it is essential for businesses to conduct thorough governance assessments and verify the capabilities of their SaaS vendors. Leveraging third-party backup solutions can significantly enhance data protection and recovery, ensuring that enterprise data remains secure and accessible,\u201d said Hoeck. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Adobe announced the general availability of Adobe Workfront Planning. Part of\u00a0Adobe Workfront, an industry-leading enterprise work management application, this new offering connects fragmented workflows and data across marketing teams, with actionable insights that allow brands to execute campaigns with greater speed. Marketers have been under increasing pressure to deliver highly personalized customer experiences, without any material increase in resources. Workfront Planning addresses this by defining and creating the \u201cmetadata\u201d of work, providing full visibility into day-to-day marketing operations. This effectively creates a \u201cmarketing system of record\u201d, a practice that has allowed other functions such as sales or finance to power planning and execution with data intelligence.\u00a0 Instead of manually gathering details across teams, Workfront Planning allows marketers to quickly answer questions such as \u201cHow many campaigns are we running this year?\u201d or \u201cWhich tactics are most frequently used in our campaigns?\u201d. Users have these actionable insights right at their fingertips, surfaced through both curated visualizations and a generative AI-powered conversational interface. This can dramatically shorten the time it takes to plan and launch new campaigns, removing the labour-intensive work of aligning teams on timing and objectives. Users can also accelerate time-to-market by leveraging generative AI to summarize information, keep marketing records up-to-date or quickly set up new campaigns. \u201cThe daily work of the modern marketer has become increasingly complex, as different teams charge forward on individual campaigns without much visibility into the efforts of their colleagues,\u201d  .\u00a0\u201cThe net result is fragmented marketing operations where too much time is spent trying to align programs and stakeholders, a problem Workfront Planning solves by providing a centralized solution to plan campaigns, deliver marketing briefs and orchestrate work across teams.\u201d\u00a0 : The marketing calendar in Workfront Planning visualizes day-to-day marketing work in an easy-to-digest format. For instance, a timeline view displays all active campaigns in a chronological format that is customizable for any team or stakeholder. A user can automatically view campaigns targeting a certain audience (e.g., loyalty program members) or for a specific objective (e.g., holiday season promotion). A spreadsheet view provides a deeper look into each campaign, providing end-to-end visibility on key messages, individual contributors, project status and more. When marketers are ready to create a new campaign, generative AI-powered capabilities will soon enable users to take action on previously static plans. Marketers will be able to simply upload existing assets (such as a presentation deck detailing the project) to create campaign records and generate a marketing brief. This curated view will include everything from marketing tactics and objectives to relevant assets and timelines. The conversational interface in Workfront Planning, powered by generative AI, also allows users to query details across campaigns, helping answer pressing questions that come up during planning stages. : Effective planning hinges on marketing records that are accurate and up-to-date. These records can include details such as target audience and region, tactics, relevant business unit and more\u2014also known as the \u201cmetadata\u201d of marketing. With the generative-AI powered conversational interface, users can automatically create or update records as plans evolve. Marketers simply upload an asset, such as a Word document with the latest campaign details, and the record is automatically updated. Records can then be connected into a marketing graph, which visualizes the connections between teams and workflows. This produces additional insights to drive alignment and shortens the time it takes to get campaigns into market. Global brands from Deloitte and IPG Health (part of Interpublic Group) to NASCAR have used Workfront Planning to boost productivity and meet the rising demand for highly personalized marketing campaigns. The new offering is also having an impact on the Adobe Global Marketing Organization, by enabling teams to develop coordinated plans and gain full visibility into marketing activities. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",

        "Article Content": "Adobe introduces a major set of improvements and upgrades to its 3D workspace in\u00a0Adobe After Effects\u00a0that make it easier for motion designers and video editors to animate and blend 3D objects seamlessly with real-world footage and 2D elements. In order to make it easier to work with 3D models and have them seamlessly blend into 2D environments, Adobe released a number of tools and controls to make it easier than ever to design in 3D and 2D at the same time. Additionally, many After Effects users are new to animating and compositing in 3D. With endless 3D models available from\u00a0Adobe Substance 3D,\u00a0Adobe Stock, and online marketplaces, motion designers want to be able to craft their work with the embedded animations that come included with their models as they dive deep into the 3D world. Now in After Effects, motion designers have an expanded range of tools when working with native 3D objects in the 3D workspace. Three major new features allow designers to make their 3D objects blend seamlessly and photo-realistically in real-world environments: \u00a0After Effects now supports embedded 3D animations from imported 3D models. Artists can breathe life into characters and objects created by external animation software. Seamlessly import 3D models (GLB or GLTF) with embedded animations such as skeletal rigs. Keyframe animations and bone-based deformations are natively supported and can be smoothly retimed. With embedded 3D animations, After Effects becomes a great place for motion designers to get started working in 3D in the motion design app they already know and love. \u00a0After Effects introduces shadow catchers, allowing 3D objects to interact realistically with video footage. Shadows cast by virtual objects onto the environment are accurately captured. Color shadows enhance realism, since shadows cast in the real world are rarely a pure shade of black or grey. \u00a0Depth maps are essential for compositing 3D elements into live-action footage. Extract depth maps from Advanced 3D scenes just by precomposing. These maps encode the distance information for each pixel, enabling post-processing effects like depth-of-field blur or fog. With over 30 all new animation presets and number counting presets for infographics, designers in After Effects can spend less time keyframing a wide variety of animations and spend more time on creative motion design. The Properties panel accelerates workflows by placing frequently used controls in one contextual panel. New for Fall 2024, designers can now adjust and control their cameras and lights in the properties panel to fine-tune their motion designs. After Effects is also getting faster with hardware accelerated UI/UX performance on Windows that\u2019s up to 4x faster than before, making the application snappier, more modern feeling, and more interactive. There\u2019s also a fresh, new design in After Effects (Beta) that\u2019s modern and more consistent so designers and editors spend less time re-learning how to use tools in our different apps and more time creating. As After Effects expands its 3D capabilities, its workflow connected to Substance 3D becomes even more powerful. Together these tools can significantly enhance the visual quality and output of After Effects\u2019 growing 3D toolset: Substance 3D Painter: Now featuring a connected \"Send to After Effects\" function, allowing you to precision-texture your 3D models and import them directly into your compositions with a single click. Substance 3D Sampler: Quickly create seamless materials with normal maps or generate IBL environment lights from photographs, perfect for harmonizing 3D elements within your After Effects scenes to customize environments and match locations. Substance 3D Assets: Gives motion designers access to over 20,000 fully licensed, ready-to-use parametric materials, 3D models, and environment lights to jumpstart your 3D projects in After Effects. \u00a0\ud83d\udc49\u00a0",
