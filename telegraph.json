        "Article Content": "Suicide prevention strategies must broaden their scope. This was the message broadcast both nationally and internationally \u2014 the latter in  on World Suicide Prevention Day Public health experts in India communicated the importance of social risk factors to policymakers, saying that suicide was not a mental health issue alone. This is also the conclusion of the researchers in the Lancet, written on this year\u2019s theme of changing the narrative on suicide. This is of the utmost importance to India, where suicide rates are higher than the global average. One study showed over 2,30,000 suicide deaths in 2016. The most tragic aspect of this is that 40% of these are of young people. India\u2019s share in world suicide deaths increased from about 25% in 1990 to 36% in 2016. This would suggest that prevention strategies are not working as they should. Perhaps the national suicide prevention strategy produced by the Union health ministry in 2022 emphasising mental health was not adequate. Helplines and clinical interventions are certainly indispensable, but primary causes must also be sought in social and economic factors. In India, these causes are hardly indiscernible. Farmers\u2019 suicides because of debt were one example. Even today, debt remains a cause of suicide. Unemployment, domestic violence, addiction, a sense of isolation are obvious causes, while suicide deaths in high-pressure institutions such as the coaching centres in Kota are a revealing example of the complex reasons for young people\u2019s despair. Students\u2019 suicides increase by 4% every year, double the national rate of increase, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Besides, a number of tragedies show that alleged caste discrimination and harassment can lead to suicide even in India\u2019s most prestigious institutions. Domestic violence, much of it silent, is, again, a persistent issue. In 2021, homemakers accounted for 51.5% of the total number of women\u2019s suicides. Even if this does not mean they all suffered from domestic violence, it also does not mean that all the deaths occurred solely from mental health problems. Addressing social risk factors, including financial, educational and gender-based issues, is uncomfortable, because it leads to questions about the quality of life based on governmental policies and practices. Yet that is the only way, coupled with clinical help, that can bring people back from the edge of hopelessness. ",

        "Article Content": "Junior doctors in Calcutta have refused to join work, saying that their protest shall continue until all their demands have been fulfilled. The Supreme Court had reportedly asked them to end their ceasework by 5 pm on September 10, assuring the protesting doctors that no action would be taken against them if they did so. If, however, they did not, adverse action could be taken against them. This was the third time that the Supreme Court had asked them to join work. This time the Trinamool Congress, too, had the same request, citing their oath to heal the sick. The junior doctors\u2019 strike began after the rape and murder of their colleague in R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9 with demands for its investigation, for security and proper conditions of work and rest in hospitals, the removal of the principal of R.G. Kar Hospital and so on. The principal was removed, some other officials too, and the probe is with the Central Bureau of Investigation with the Supreme Court keeping a close eye on it. The health department claims that safety features, resting areas and washrooms are being introduced, although they cannot be completed by September 10. Meanwhile, the junior doctors\u2019 demands have grown in number. In the latest set of conditions for their return to work are the resignation of the police chief, the health secretary, the director of health education and the director of health services, the last three to \u2018cleanse\u2019 the health sector. Their prolonged absence from work has meant an enormous load for senior doctors; even then many patients are going untreated while surgeries and medical tests are being cancelled. So far it has been claimed that over 20 patients have died because of lack of treatment. This is a tragic outcome. But even if so many patients had not died, it cannot be denied that the junior doctors\u2019 prime responsibility is towards their patients. Their anger and suspicions are understandable, so is their need to protest and to register their grief and horror at the violent death of their colleague. Their protest was greeted with sympathy and admiration in the first few days. But should doctors hold the state to ransom at the cost of human lives? They have raised many crucial questions, but this is a question they must answer.",

        "Article Content": "Climate change isn\u2019t just scorching summers, raging wildfires, or coastal populations sinking into the sea. It\u2019s also about military security. As the polar ice recedes, the Arctic, once a desolate expanse of frozen wilderness, is fast becoming the world\u2019s newest strategic arena. Sea lanes that were once impassable are opening up, oil and gas reserves long locked beneath ice are now accessible, and the Arctic is quickly transforming from frozen obscurity to a site of conflict. Climate change, far from an abstract threat, is reshaping the contours of global security. This isn\u2019t hyperbole. On Tuesday, Russia\u2019s defence ministry released footage on Telegram of joint Arctic naval drills with China. These war games, scheduled to run until September 16, are about Russia projecting strength along what could be the next military frontier. The once silent, frozen North is thawing, and Russia has planted its flag squarely on the softening ground. The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world. Global temperatures have risen by an average of 1.1\u00b0C since the Industrial Revolution but in the Arctic, that number has been closer to 3\u00b0C since the 1980s. The ice is retreating with an alarming speed. Northern members of NATO, Norway in particular, are caught between environmental aspirations and the demands of global energy markets. They now face the unenviable task of managing a crisis that they have unwittingly helped fuel. The Arctic, in Moscow\u2019s view, is not just a resource grab; it\u2019s longstanding territory. In 2021, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, had made his stance clear: \u201cIt has been absolutely clear for everyone for a long time that this is our territory...\u201d Russia has taken that statement seriously, building infrastructure across more than 4,300 miles of its Siberian Arctic plateau, revamping ports, building new civilian outposts, and is even constructing a floating nuclear power plant. Seventeen full-service ports are in the works along the Northern Sea Route as Moscow angles to control the critical arteries that have opened up in the wake of the retreating ice. But even with its vast Arctic coastline, Moscow\u2019s grip isn\u2019t ironclad. The Northern Fleet, Russia\u2019s crown jewel of nuclear deterrence, is confined by the harsh geography of the Kola Peninsula. Its submarines must navigate the shallow Barents Sea under NATO\u2019s watchful eye. This tension highlights Russia\u2019s precarious position despite its ambition. Norway, on NATO\u2019s leading northern flank, is more critical than ever as Sweden and Finland have joined the alliance recently. A founding member of NATO, Norway has pledged an unprecedented defence expansion, increasing conscripts from 9,000 to 13,500, and boosting defence spending by 51 billion Norwegian Euros over the next dozen years. This is a historic shift from neutral Norway, which has long blended policies of deterrence with reassurance to maintain relations with Russia for decades. But context matters. For comparison, Poland has spent an equivalent of 4.12% of its GDP on defence, which is the highest level among NATO members and more than double the alliance\u2019s 2% of GDP guideline. Poland is among the less affluent nations of the NATO alliance, with its GDP   being just a little more than half of Norway\u2019s. Nevertheless, Poland boasts a conscript force of 200,000 and spent 23 billion euros on defence in 2023 alone. Norway\u2019s defence budget, even with its eye-catching increase, pales in comparison. For a country sitting on NATO\u2019s Arctic doorstep, and in comparison to other member states, are Norway\u2019s contributions adequate or equitable? Norway\u2019s role in this Arctic drama is also riddled with contradictions. The nation is a global paragon of climate action, proudly pledging a plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2030. But beneath this veneer of environmental responsibility lies a glaring paradox: Norway is one of the world\u2019s largest exporters of oil and gas. Demand for Norwegian resources are only increasing since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as allies boycott Russian oil and gas. Norway stands as the fifth-largest oil exporter and third-largest natural gas supplier and exports reached their highest amount in a decade in 2023. While its domestic efforts to curb emissions are commendable, the oil rigs scattered across the North Sea continue to churn out the very fuel that accelerates the melting of the polar ice \u2014 and, with it, the very crisis that threatens Norway\u2019s own security. In this sense, Norway has positioned itself as both the healer and the harmer. As the ice melts, so too does its credibility as a global climate leader. Poland\u2019s approach is also not without criticism. Global dependency on oil and gas strengthens Russia, no matter which way you look at it. Whether these resources are purchased directly from Russia or not, carbon-based fuel usage is melting the north, which Russia is well-prepared to dominate. In Poland\u2019s case, instead of using some of its budget on military expenses, it could invest in carbon neutral infrastructure that would reduce its overall dependency on oil and gas and, thereby, do its part to prevent new military opportunities for Russia. Compared to Norway, Poland has drastically deprioritised carbon neutrality, offering climate plans that rely on emission absorption rather than emission reduction. It is also making relatively distant commitments in comparison to other nations. The Arctic\u2019s transformation isn\u2019t just a Russia-NATO stand-off. China\u2019s growing interest in the region and its increased friendship with Russia are concerning those who see China\u2019s power as a potential threat for global stability. The United States of America has started responding with Arctic military drills named \u2018Operation Polar Dagger\u2019, a testament to the shifting focus on the region. Climate change is no longer an abstract environmental issue, something to be addressed by future generations or with feel-good global accords that kick the climate can down the road. It is here, it is now, and it is driving geopolitical realignments with breathtaking speed. The Arctic, once an afterthought in global power struggles, is now at the centre of the world\u2019s next great contest for resources and strategic dominance. If NATO is serious about Arctic defence, it must first take climate change seriously. The far north is becoming a crucible for international conflict and unless the West faces the harsh reality that the melting ice is more than just an environmental tragedy, it will be caught flat-footed in the global race for the Arctic. Norway, for its part, must reconcile its dual role as Arctic\u2019s defender and offender. It can no longer afford to be both an oil giant and a climate hero. Something\u2019s got to give. Other NATO allies must also do their part by shifting their thinking about contributions from being solely in terms of military capabilities to investments in carbon neutrality to slow or even stop polar melting. The Arctic is heating up \u2014 both literally and figuratively. The Arctic is no longer a remote, icy expanse and climate change is not just an environmental concern, but a strategic one as well. As the ice melts, the world\u2019s future is increasingly bound to the far north. If we fail to confront the twin crises of climate change and the militarisation of the Arctic, we risk losing more than just polar ice. We risk stability itself.",

        "Article Content": "Less than two months before the presidential elections in the United States of America, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the former president, Donald Trump, faced off in their first and possibly only debate on Tuesday night in Philadelphia. The two contestants had never met before, and the occasion was widely billed by pundits as an opportunity for the American public and the world to learn more about the policies that Ms Harris and Mr Trump would pursue if they won the election. Yet in 90 minutes of sparring, neither major party candidate offered any fresh insight into how they would approach either domestic challenges, such as soaring grocery bills and climate change, or global crises like the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. Instead, tens of millions of viewers in the US and around the world witnessed the latest episode of the predictable reality television that masquerades as electoral politics in the world\u2019s second-largest democracy. Ms Harris and Mr Trump traded barbs, each accusing the other of weakening democracy, damaging the US economy, and making the world less safe. There were bizarre moments, from Mr Trump claiming, without evidence, that Haitian immigrants were eating their neighbours\u2019 pets to Ms Harris effectively blaming her opponent for handing Afghanistan over to the Taliban, when it was her administration, under President Joe Biden, that carried through the chaotic US withdrawal from Kabul.  Far too often, the debate felt like a sequel that repeated a script that the US and the world have seen too many times before. Ms Harris accused Mr Trump of being soft on Russia, while Mr Trump blamed Ms Harris for a porous southern border. Neither pushed the other \u2014 and the moderators did not either \u2014 to flesh out exactly how they would control inflation, increase jobs, or end the wars in Europe and the Middle East that the US is deely involved in. By most accounts, Ms Harris delivered a stronger debate performance than her rival. But US voters and a world affected significantly by America\u2019s choices deserve better than such a performance. In the past, presidential debates have often had little impact on voter choices, although there have been exceptions. It is unclear whether the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s debate will be any different. What is clear is that irrespective of which candidate experts declare as the winner of the debate, US voters and those observing the election around the world lost out. ",

        "Article Content": "In the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections, a group of young men in rural Maharashtra joked to me about their precarious situation. They are educated, they said, but unemployed and unmarried. That small group of men in their early to mid-thirties, from a small cotton-growing village, actually echoed the sentiments you come across in large swathes of India. Education \u2014 quality, English-medium education \u2014 is a ticket to jobs. Jobs are a ticket to finding good life partners. That unmarried, educated women from the countryside are reluctant to marry into farming households and move into other villages where life and living are not kosher is a fact that is starkly obvious. It is worse in regions suffering from climatic aberrations such as frequent floods or cyclical droughts. Their priority is to marry into families in small towns where their future husbands would have a steady government or private-sector job. That explains the anger and anxiety prevailing in small towns and rural India, particularly among the country\u2019s working-age population. Farming is not paying and jobs are few and far between. Even meagerly paying government jobs, with permanence and certainty, have the first preference among the youths in the working age over private-sector, contractual jobs. Close to two million youths applied for 20,000-odd police con\u00adstabulary positions in Ma\u00adharashtra. Close to 4,00,000 people, which included 40,000 graduates and post-graduates, threw their hat in the ring last week in Haryana to bag contractual jobs for sweepers. The Indian IT firms have reportedly delayed onboarding of freshers, who have offer letters for more than two years. Across rural India, rackets of providing job letters \u2014 and not actual jobs \u2014 to men to materialise marriages are on the rise. Gangs that fleece men and women with the promise of jobs and marriages have a free run. The less that is said about job examinations where the papers are always leaked the better. In the absence of meaningful employment, what is attracting young people is speculative investments: share market, FnO, rummy apps, easy loan apps,   markets, and traditional and digital gambling, among a range of other options, are gaining traction, particularly among the youth, owing to social media. Unemployment is the elephant in the room. Unemploy\u00adability is even worse. As this column is being written,  is running a series on how \u2018skil\u00adled\u2019 Indian workers recruited by foreign firms have left their employers scrat\u00adching their heads over the lack of basic skills in these men who have ultimately been sacked and sent home. That India is sending men to Israel to take over jobs meant for Palestinians is a different story. Unemployment, rural crisis, ecological devastation, rise of cronyism, breakdown in governance, death of universal values, increasing attacks and sexual assaults on women of all ages, widening of social and economic inequalities, religious bigotry, near-stagnant production and manufacturing, and political-criminal-contractor nexus in government contracts are all inter-connected and form what the historian, Adam Tooze, calls a \u201cpoly-crisis\u201d. Amidst all this tumult, the State\u2019s political response to the economic and social conundrums seems to be a one-stop solution: direct cash transfers or monetary promises to constituencies that would help political parties keep the throne and momentarily tide over the crisis until the next one shows up. But things have come to a boil. The silence of the Indian elite, however, allows an unchecked run to self-appointed experts on YouTube with their 30-second reels, giving half-baked and preposterous   on every issue under the sun. We perhaps need a resurrection of sanity and values within our institutions, a re-imagination to bring our national life on the tracks.",

        "Article Content": "Yogendra Yadav\u2019s two recent articles in  have initiated an interesting public discussion on the relevance and the future trajectory of what may be called Indian political theory. Yadav highlights a set of issues \u2014 an \u201c\u2026 emaciation of our political vision, the shrinkage in the vocabulary of politics, the withering away of our political understanding, the poverty of political judgement and the recession in the agenda for political action\u201d \u2014 to conclude that \u201c[t]he river of ideas\u2026 has suddenly dried up.\u201d This critical assessment of contemporary political thinking has led to a highly sophisticated and nuanced debate. A section of scholars, especially political scientists, argues that academic analysis of Indian politics \u2014 critical mapping of political phenomena in their entirety, their logical explanations and appraisal, and the exploration of the avenues where new forms of politics get shaped and nurtured \u2014 cannot be underestimated. Indian political theory, it is claimed, is a rich subfield of political science, which is flourishing in a variety of ways. Yadav acknowledges this line of argument in his rejoinder. He also admits the political value of scholarly interventions. However, Yadav further clarifies the fact that his primary purpose is to investigate the reasons that led to the decline of imaginative political thinking in India over the years. More precisely, he emphasises the need to have a \u201ccollective deliberation on why we reached this place, and what can be done to reinvigorate this lifeline of our republic.\u201d This is an important question. While it is true that contemporary Indian politics is being studied and analysed as a serious object of academic research, the relationship between political   and political   (at least in the narrower sense of the term) is almost insubstantial. Political parties do not engage with the intellectual class. There are intellectual wings in most national parties which often function in collaboration with affiliated organisations, especially in universities. However, these bodies do not function as independent think tanks; instead, these intellectual wings are used to capture academic institutions for establishing political dominance. The party intellectuals thus behave like official spokespersons simply to disseminate the message of the top leadership.  That is one of the reasons why professional academics do not want to be associated with such intellectual wings. It is important to remember that our democracy has become highly election-centric. Political parties envisage elections as the main arena of competitive politics. The big ideas, such as social transformation, imagination of an egalitarian society, establishment of a just economic system, are, consequentially, reduced to proposed policy initiatives. The election process has been transformed into a political marketplace to address voters as consumers. This framework forces the political elite to look out for ready-to-use, bullet-point responses, which might be used for making electoral packages more appealing and effectual. This, in turn, reduces the possibility of a long term and sustainable political engagement with the intellectual class. At the same time, it provides the political class the confidence to rely on a business-like imagination of actual politics. The success of the idea of   in election is a good example in this regard. There are, however, a set of scholars who try to bridge the gap between intellectual work and political life of the country. A long list of intellectuals \u2014 Ashutosh Varshney, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, Suhas Palshikar, Sandeep Shastri, Suraj Yengde, Harish Wankhede, Christophe Jaffrelot, Ramachandra Guha, Sanjay Kumar, Mukul Kesavan, Abhay Dubey, Ashok Pandey, Peter R. deSouza, Zoya Hasan, Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, Nivedita Menon, Nandini Sundar, Rama Lakshmi, Asim Ali, Yogendra Yadav and many others \u2014 contributes significantly to shape the nature of public debates in India. Yogendra Yadav\u2019s intervention, in this sense, is more relevant. It recognises the separation between professional academic research and the actual business of politics; yet, at the same time, he calls upon the observers, analysts, and practitioners of politics to collectively think and produce futuristic imaginations of politics in the Indian context.  There are two important issues, which require serious attention to understand Yadav\u2019s rather provocative observation about the decline of political thinking. First, there is an invitation to discover a   of comprehensive social change. Yadav\u2019s recent writings underline a crucial distinction between   (which sticks to a particular identity as the ultimate vantage point for political action) and   (a profound, multilayered, nuanced form of politics, which gives due recognition to uncomfortable facts and internal contradictions). The public debate on Muslim identity is a good example to elucidate this distinction.  politics relies heavily on a homogeneous and undifferentiated Muslim identity to sustain the Hindu-Muslim divide. This has helped it project every aspect of Muslim social life as a problematic phenomenon. The opponents of   have questioned this obvious demonisation of Muslims. They evoke secular, democratic values of the Constitution to refute all kinds of communalism. No one can deny the significance of this egalitarian-democratic form of politics. However, the problem arises when the internal contradictions among Muslims \u2014 caste-based exclusion of Dalit and Pasmanda Muslims and the marginalisation of Muslim women \u2014 are projected as unimportant, troublesome and  -sponsored issues. From Yadav\u2019s point of view, this strategic silence on internal contradictions may be described as the shallow politics of identity, which would eventually contribute to a totalising framework promoted by the   groups in the name of nationalism. This brings us to the second facet of Yadav\u2019s argument. He claims that the national movement was an intellectual resource, which played a significant role in the making of the Constitution. Postcolonial Indian politics, especially in the early decades after Independence, inherited the values and ideals of the national movement. The Constitution, in this sense, is not merely a legal document; it is a political manifesto, which encourages us to get involved in the egalitarian politics of human emancipation and socio-economic equality. In other words, the Constitution is a legitimate resource for us to produce new and more radical imaginations of social change. This proposal, in my view, goes beyond the two given narratives of our times \u2014 the Constitution is a sacred book, which must always be obeyed as a legal directive and the Constitution is under threat and, hence, it must be protected. Yadav\u2019s thesis wants us to have a new kind of political vision, which might help us produce new ideas of India. The present debate, it seems, is certainly contributing in this direction. ",

        "Article Content": "In May, the NEET-UG examination for undergraduate medical admissions faced multiple allegations of discrepancies and fraud. NET, an exam that decides whether an individual can teach college students, was cancelled on similar grounds. This is a deeply worrying trend for Indian higher education and society. However, behind these examination scams lies something more pernicious: the seductive allure of merit. Why has meritocracy become so central to our lives? Economic anxieties and wealth inequality are plausible explanations. In an unequal world, people are anxious to \u2018make it big\u2019 to secure a larger share of the social dividend. But there is more to merit than this \u2018economic\u2019 explanation: people want to be seen as self-made. CEOs thus often emphasise their \u2018middle-class\u2019 background and frugal lifestyle even when they are born into wealth and privilege. This helps them preach that anyone can succeed if they try. But is the success of an individual entirely his/her own doing? Are not factors like class, caste, and race relevant? Privileged individuals have more resources, opportunities, and networks that give them a head-start. Moreover, merit is deeply entwined with \u2018cultural capital\u2019 that creates a sense of belonging among individuals coming from similar backgrounds. This leads to an unconscious bias that significantly impacts many decisions, palpably manifest in job interviews. Merit, therefore, should be understood in this subjective framework. The acknowledgement of shared cultural capital influencing our perceptions of what qualifies as meritorious is necessary. The subjectivity of merit is evident in its historical evolution. The idea of merit has been shaped by the values and the biases of each era. Ancient societies valued physical strength and military prowess, while the Renaissance emphasised intellectual achievements. The industrial age prioritised technical skills and innovation and, today, merit includes educational qualifications, professional experience, emotional intelligence, and cultural awareness. Institutional mechanisms for assessing merit, such as standardised tests and interviews, are also contingent upon the idea of merit of the time. As society evolves, so does the concept of merit. This brings us to another intriguing question: is a theoretically perfect meritocracy desirable? In    , Michael Sandel provides a startling inversion of what is \u2018common sense\u2019: does one\u2019s possession of the capacity to provide the services that the market demands legitimise his/her claim to an increased share of the social dividend? For instance, a highly-skilled cricketer born in a country that doesn\u2019t value cricket is likely to be pauperised and compelled to do tasks considered \u2018menial\u2019 to earn a livelihood. In a society where this meritocratic hubris prevails, the arbitrariness of talent and its relation with what the economy demands is glossed over. A person could be considered \u2018meritorious\u2019 in one society and lacking merit in another with the same skills. It is due to this arbitrariness that Friedrich Hayek and John Rawls reject the idea that economic rewards should reflect what people \u2018deserve\u2019. This is a provocative proposition, for it means challenging the values that are embedded in \"untutored public opinion\", which holds that justice implies giving people what they truly deserve. Meritocracy has led to cut-throat competition among students as though they are corporate conglomerates, eager to eliminate their rivals. The corruption in education is directly linked with this meritocratic culture. Additionally, the notion that one\u2019s success is one\u2019s own doing has led the successful to look down upon those who could not succeed. This fuels resentment amongst the \u2018unsuccessful lot\u2019 which finds expression in \u2018populism\u2019. The sense of dispossession among the \u2018unsuccessful\u2019 is exploited by far-Right movements promising to restore a lost sense of identity.",

This kind of behaviour is an instance of reverse casteism where the onus of caste is placed on Dalits while the Brahminical castes are portrayed as casteless. 'Casual casteism' is the mode of practising casteism through the ambivalence of castelessness. It is a term that denotes the everyday use of language and behaviour, which allows dominant castes to indulge in the free-play of caste oppression. The term, casual, is particularly important here \u2014 it allows the free-play of certain kinds of action, language, and usage of words, including behaviours and gestures, without inviting severe implications. That which is casual by nature becomes distanced from the serious and the legal. Casual is denoted by a meaning ascribed to the perception of something that is so familiar, common, and ordinary that it is not seen as an exception. Thus, casual casteism does not invest the citizen with moral and ethical duties or invite penal measures. One of the significant ways to understand casual casteism is to examine the specific ways in which dominant castes operationalise it. Casual casteism occurs in public spaces such as universities, institutions, social circles, and the workplace. Even the most common bonds among students, friends, and associated relations are exposed to the violence of casual casteism. It is displayed by dominant-caste people through narrative and rhetoric while attempting to maintain a superficial air of intent and purpose. Casual casteism is often ambivalent and indistinct. How then does one decide whether a remark or a gesture is casual or casteist? Who has the power of decision in this context? Casual casteism usually involves a dominant-caste person naturally assuming his right to find faults with a Dalit person and construing Dalits to be deviants, unfit for public or private presence. Public spaces often witness such remarks as Dalits are ugly, cannot speak correctly, do not get good marks, are not skilled in extra-curricular activities, are not smart enough to put up cultural performances, are backward, timid, awkward, incompetent and worthless. Casual casteism constructs caste stereotypes that normalise the everyday behaviour of the dominant castes and depict Dalits in poor light. Contemporary Indian campuses witness interactions among students from different castes. Dominant castes project their discomfort in more ways than one, including demeaning gazes, talking to and treating fellow Dalit friends in a manner that allows the unfolding of casual casteism without it being expressly identifiable. Questions such as 'How did you get this job?', narratives like 'There is no difficulty for you to get jobs since you are using quota,' or behaviour such as withholding recognition and withdrawing interaction are instances of everyday casual casteism. Casual casteism also occurs through jokes and slang that are aimed to emphasise the superiority of the dominant castes and the cultural inferiority of Dalits. Casual casteism violates commonality. Here, the perception of the ordinary is used to legitimise the norms of unethical and immoral thought and action. Casual casteism permits the continuity of caste in the garb of benign ordinariness, leaving Dalits \u2014 the targets of casual casteism \u2014 confounded about whether they are the recipients of casual casteism or something else.",

        "Article Content": "Sir \u2014 Surveillance versus privacy has been a topic of raging debate since the arrest of the co-founder of Telegram and the banning of X in Brazil. Adding fuel to the fire, the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, recently said that his government will ban teenagers from accessing social media. The idea behind this \u2014 the need to protect youngsters from cyber threats before they are mature enough to understand the perils of social media \u2014 is laudable. But children would benefit more from gradually learning to use the internet while being monitored rather than dealing with a sudden exposure to social media later in life. Sir \u2014 The recent flare-up of violence in Manipur indicates that contrary to the claims made by the Centre and the state government, normalcy is yet to return to the region (\u201cKuki ex-soldier killed on Meitei turf\u201d, Sept 10). The tension can escalate into riots again if the situation is not addressed urgently. The Centre must make sure that the territorial integrity of Manipur is maintained. The chasm between the Kuki-Zo people and the Meiteis has deepened. The indifference of the government has cost Manipur numerous lives and led to the mass displacement of people. It is ironic that followers of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, claim that he can stop international wars while he remains incapable of solving domestic problems. Sir \u2014 Manipur has relapsed into ethnic skirmishes, once again. Narendra Modi has done precious little to solve the burning issues plaguing the state. Even as Manipur sees a resurgence of communal violence, incidents of cow vigilantism have started recurring in other states. Modi must now turn his attention away from international tours to douse the fires at home. Sir \u2014 Restoring law and order requires more than just promises. The government must bring the situation in Manipur under control by cracking down on extremist groups. The demand for a separate administration is unjustified. The state and the Central government must promptly take ameliorative steps. Sir \u2014 The government must oppose the demand for a separate administration in Manipur. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in Manipur should stop spreading its divisive propaganda in the state before it is too late. Sir \u2014 Despite tall claims by the BJP-led government, violence has become normalised in the country. Terrorist activities, internal strife, riots and looting have been occuring unabated in India. However, Manipur\u2019s problem has acquired an important dimension with the usage of rockets and drones by the extremists. This is an issue of national security. Instead of shifting the blame on the erstwhile Congress government, the Centre needs to get a grip on the situation. The BJP government has been vocal in demanding the resignation of chief ministers of states that are ruled by Opposition parties. What happens to such a demand when it comes to states under its own rule? Sir \u2014 New Delhi has shown little interest in addressing the socio-political tensions in Manipur. The state has been left to fend for itself. Charity should begin at home. Instead of trying to broker peace between other nations, the Centre would do well to mitigate domestic troubles. Sir \u2014 People in West Bengal have decided not to celebrate Durga Puja on a grand scale this year owing to the rape and murder of a young doctor at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital (\u201cWeavers\u2019 woes: Protests take a toll on Puja sari sales\u201d, Sept 9). This can cause a loss of nearly 35 crore for several traders. In spite of this, the solidarity shown with the victim is commendable. The West Bengal government must clean up its act. The chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, seems unmoved by people\u2019s plight. Sir \u2014 Many Durga Puja committees in West Bengal have returned the state government\u2019s financial aid. This is a protest against the government\u2019s continued inaction regarding women\u2019s safety in Bengal. However, this has caused problems for   Several committees are choosing not to hire  and going for a small-scale celebrations instead. The loss of livelihood for the  is a serious concern. The Puja organising committees should consider hiring  by cutting down on other ritualistic expenditures. Sir \u2014 Durga Puja generates a trade of nearly 40,000 crore. However, this year, owing to the ongoing protests, wholesalers and retailers will face severe economic setbacks. The protestors should consider this.",

        "Article Content": "Sir \u2014 There are arguments both for and against veganism. But surely the trend of pet parents forcing their carnivorous pets to eat vegan food is not conscionable. This does not fulfil their nutritional requirements, leading to poor health and, in some cases, even an early death. While every individual has the right to make dietary choices for himself or herself based on moral or other considerations, one must not force these choices down the gullets of those who cannot object, such as a pet cat or a dog. The health of pets must be of foremost importance to humans who have opted to take care of them. In an attempt to alleviate cruelty towards certain animals, we must be careful not to unwittingly subject other animals to cruelty by depriving them of their natural diet. Sir \u2014 The Indian contingent at the Paris Paralympics has performed with great zeal (\u201cBigger haul, better results show India\u2019s medal mettle\u201d, Sept 9). India managed to clinch 29 medals, including seven gold, nine silver and 13 bronze. India has successfully surpassed its performance at Tokyo Paralympics. Some noteworthy performers were Avani Lekhara, Yogesh Kathuniya, Nishad Kumar and Sumit Antil. India is lucky to have such talented athletes. Sir \u2014 India\u2019s para-athletes have made the nation proud. These athletes have been able to transform adversity into strength. Behind every medal won there are countless hours of practise, numerous setbacks, and a tireless pursuit of excellence. Their success is a beacon of hope for thousands. Perseverance, dedication and talent can overcome the greatest of challenges. Sir \u2014 India\u2019s differently-abled athletes have bagged more medals than their counterparts did at the Paris Olympics earlier. The government should make efforts to promote sports for athletes with special needs. This would not only boost their morale but also give their life a purpose. The impressive showing of India\u2019s para-athletes speaks of their indomitable spirit. Acknowledging their talent will inspire them to continue to train harder. Sir \u2014 It is unfortunate that in spite of the International Court of Justice ruling that it is plausible that Israel is carrying out a genocide in Gaza, India has granted licenses for the export of arms and munitions to Tel Aviv (\u201cPlea to stop arms supply to Israel\u201d, Sept 5). India has some legal obligations under the Genocide Convention of the United Nations to which it is a party. It thus should not export weapons to Israel when there is a serious risk that these might be used to commit war crimes. The companies involved in these exports include public sector enterprises under the Union ministry of defence as well as private companies. A petition against such exports has been made to the Supreme Court. Besides violating the Genocide Convention, an export of arms goes against India\u2019s policy of non-alignment. It also belies the statement of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, that India is on the side of peace. Sir \u2014 The indifference of the world towards Rohingyas is shameful (\u201cThousands of Rohingya flee to Bangladesh\u201d, Sept 5). One fails to understand why the United Nations has not been able to prevail on Myanmar to stop its atrocities on the Rohingyas. The Indian government cannot remain a silent spectator to such ethnic cleansing in its neighbourhood. It must exercise its influence in the corridors of power to rein in Myanmar. The global diplomatic community has a moral responsibility to stop the systemic and systematic oppression of Rohingyas in Myanmar. Sir \u2014 Besides flash floods, landslides and cloudbursts, shooting stones are yet another natural hazard that will be intensified with climate change-induced rainfall. Shooting stones are basically huge rocks or boulders that roll down mountain slopes crushing everything in their paths. Besides causing traffic disruptions, they also pose a threat to life and property. Continuous rains, landslides and sudden tremors can cause shooting stones. It is high time that the authorities take steps to prevent such accidents. Stabilising the slopes and taking steps to prevent soil erosion can reduce the threat posed by shooting stones. The installation of early warning systems would also help alert the authorities and the public about potential threats. Sir \u2014 While presenting the Union budget this year, the finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, announced a slew of initiatives aimed at skilling the youth and creating jobs. Such schemes, with an outlay of rupees two lakh crore for a five-year period, are also an acknowledgement of the crisis of unemployment in the country. Unemployment in India is not simply owing to a lack of opportunities but also because many people lack the right skills. Sir \u2014 It is a relief that Anant Ambani\u2019s Vantara Foundation has reached out to the Namibian government to extend a helping hand in the face of the severe drought in that country which is threatening the wildlife there. Namibia has sanction\u00aded the culling of over 700 animals because of the food shortage caused by the drought. The Vantara Foundation\u2019s offer of help is thus a godsend. One hopes Namibia accepts this help and decides against killing animals.",

        "Article Content": "It will probably be some time before last Monday\u2019s orders and observations by the three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by the Chief Justice of India are fully digested by the stakeholders in the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital imbroglio. At the time of writing (Tuesday afternoon), there are some stray points of clarity.  First, the appeal by the CJI to the striking junior doctors to return to work and prevent a collapse of the public health system has been interpreted by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress ecosystem as a victory of sorts. Bruised by the experience, the chief minister extended the hand of friendship and dialogue to the colleagues of \u2018Abhaya\u2019 \u2014 the junior doctor who was brutally raped and murdered at her place of work on August 9. However, the chief minister\u2019s apparent contrition was coupled with the astonishingly insensitive assertion that it was time for the people of West Bengal to forget the agitation and immerse themselves in \u2018festivities\u2019. At the same time, the chief minister (who also holds the health portfolio) didn\u2019t concede that her government had been guilty of any wrongdoing \u2014 whether over allegations of destruction of evidence or the attempted bribery of Abhaya\u2019s parents.  Secondly, perhaps because of the chief minister\u2019s rationed response to an upheaval that has rocked the state for a month, the response of the junior doctors was an insolent letter that made it clear that the agitation wasn\u2019t going to be withdrawn. The junior doctors were also loath to await the findings of the Central Bureau of Investigation on the important question of evidence tampering and other alleged police improprieties. They persisted with their demand that Calcutta\u2019s police commissioner, Vineet Goyal, must resign immediately.  Thirdly, going strictly by anecdotal evidence and social media postings of those who had immersed themselves in the movement, the instinctive reaction of the people involved in the Justice for Abhaya movement to the Supreme Court proceedings was one of outrage. The feeling is that the apex court had been unmindful of the public mood, had believed the spin of the state government of an imminent health crisis, and hadn\u2019t set clear deadlines for the CBI. This disappointment also reinforced a prevailing perception that the voice of ordinary Bengalis didn\u2019t matter to the Delhi Establishment. This, in turn, injected new life into the belief that there was a \u2018setting\u2019 between Mamata and Modi, a perception the Left has assiduously promoted.  Fourthly, there is a minority view among politicians in the anti-Mamata camp that the state government\u2019s position in the Abhaya case is precarious. If the CBI can confirm the widespread impression that there was a blatant disregard for procedures by the Kolkata Police and even a wilful suppression of evidence, it would put Mamata Banerjee in an untenable position. If this cover-up can be complemented by the CBI establishing corrupt practices in the institutions of medical education, the chief minister would find it very difficult to cling on to her position. Under the circumstances, they feel that the CBI must be put under sustained pressure to treat this investigation as its utmost priority. A section of the Bharatiya Janata Party is particularly invested in the Supreme Court being the harbinger of a regime change in West Bengal.  Conspiracy theorists also see a curious convergence between the interests of a section of the BJP and a so-called Camac Street faction of the Trinamool Congress. Last Saturday, at a Ganesh  hosted by a senior Union minister, I was asked by a senior BJP functionary if the prolonged agitation was being bankrolled by those in the Trinamool Congress who want Mamata to hang up her boots.  What is important is not the veracity of these whispers; they merely suggest that while there is a romance of street protests, the same turbulence offers alternative possibilities to others.  On earlier occasions when Bengal was rocked by political turbulence, there was persistent speculation that the Centre would step in to impose president\u2019s rule. The speculations were usually baseless since Supreme Court judgments have imposed stringent safeguards against the removal of elected governments. However, the whispers kept alive a low level of political discourse.  It is intriguing that the prognosis of the governor getting set for an enlarged role has barely registered during the Justice for Abhaya movement. There could be many reasons, including the inadvisability of making a martyr of Mamata Banerjee. What is also significant is that for the moment there are no obvious political gainers from such a colossal movement, although experience suggests that the principal Opposition party is the inevitable beneficiary.  This is not to suggest that neither the Left nor the BJP has attempted to take over the movement. The Left, far more experienced than the Bengal BJP in infiltrating and moulding movements, has had nominal success in spreading Left-inclined songs and slogans among the impressionable. In and around Jadavpur, the Left has successfully used the rhythmic chant of  \u2014 especially when the chanting is led by a Tollywood star \u2014 to motivate younger women. It is only a matter of time before the scope of  is extended to issues so dear to the urban Naxals. At the same time, the Left cannot but be mindful of the significance of the Tricolour emerging as the movement\u2019s sole identity. Its ideological posturing is unlikely to make a mark in this climate of virtuous uprightness. The BJP\u2019s role is a more mixed bag despite its lead role in the Nabanna march on August 27 and its 12-hour  the next day. It is an open secret that there is one section of the wider saffron fraternity that is wary of rocking the boat in a way that would be beneficial to the Left. Whether that section diverted energies into ineffective and largely invisible  is a matter of conjecture. What can be said with certainty is that the BJP\u2019s paucity of middle-class  bench-strength and its overall organisational weakness in the Greater Calcutta region prevented a more focussed intervention. The local party\u2019s curious aversion to newcomers, its hounding out of the celebrities who had teamed up with it in 2021, and the non-existence of a student wing may have also determined its feeble intervention. At the same time, if the Justice for Abhaya campaign widens into a movement against 13 years of Trinamool Congress misrule and moves beyond the cultural confines of Calcutta, the BJP will be the principal beneficiary. Yet, all conclusions are tentative. The mood in Bengal is still work in progress.",

        "Article Content": "The undercurrents of big-power politics and their possible fallouts have been a buzzword for long in the Northeast. The Myanmar crisis, following the February 2021 military coup, and, now, the regime change in Bangladesh bear fresh evidence of this. These neighbourhood troubles could have come from internal contradictions. But the possibility of big-power interests as a causal factor should not be dismissed considering the strategic importance of this geography. Thant Myint-U had anticipated this ( ) as also Bertil Lintner ( ). Both inferred that Western powers would certainly have an interest here. The region\u2019s colonial history should provide reasons for this caution. Not everything in this game is what it appears to be. The case of the India-China border standoff at Doklam in Sikkim over a road China was building is illustrative. China claimed, citing an 1890 boundary treaty with the British determining Sikkim\u2019s territorial extent, that the part of Doklam in which it was building the road belonged to it. The British did sign this treaty, and another, on trade concessions in Tibet, in 1893, but, interestingly, with China and not Tibet. Alastair Lamb has some answers to this in his two-volume  . In 1886, the British planned a trade mission to Lhasa led by the civil servant, Colman Macaulay. The Chinese, too weak to oppose the British, tried to dissuade this by saying that the Tibetans would oppose the plan, indicating their weak hold over Tibet. The Macaulay mission was ultimately abandoned. However, unaware of this, the Tibetans sent a detachment to the Sikkimese village of Lingtu, which they claimed was theirs, to blockade \u201cthe main road from Darjeeling to the Tibetan border at the Chumbi Valley, along which Colman Macaulay was expected to travel,\u201d writes Lamb. Despite appeals by the British, the Chinese did little. In 1888, Viceroy Dufferin authorised his troops to clear the blockade. Dufferin also became convinced that Tibet's affairs would be best dealt with Lhasa, not Peking. However, the 1890 and 1893 treaties were still signed with Peking, not Lhasa. Britain\u2019s anxiety, Lamb reasons, was that entering into treaties with Tibet would give a seal to Tibetans entering into similar treaties with Russia. This anxiety prompted Britain to force the St. Petersburg Convention 1907 on Russia which was then on the back foot, having suffered a naval defeat at the hands of Japan in 1905. To ensure that Russia was kept away from Tibet, the treaty made it a condition for Britain and Russia to deal with Tibet only through China\u2019s mediation. But the British ended up tying themselves up in knots. During the Simla Conference of 1913-1914 to define the India-Tibet boundary, China had to be made a party. China walked out of the conference and the rest is history. Dufferin\u2019s successor, Lord Curzon, was hawkish and adopted the former\u2019s doctrine of bypassing China in dealing with Tibet. When he became convinced that the 13th Dalai Lama was leaning towards Russia, he authorised the Francis Younghusband Mission to invade Tibet and force the Lhasa Convention 1904, virtually making Chumbi Valley, which includes Doklam, Indian territory. For Curzon, controlling Tibet was important for India\u2019s security. He spells this out in his Romanes Lecture 1907 titled \"Frontier\". However, Morley was scornful of the approach and wrote in a letter to Minto that \u201cthese frontier men\u201d cannot see the bigger picture. If not for this shadow war, it is likely that Tibet and Sikkim would have remained as Bhutan has, making India\u2019s Siliguri corridor's vulnerability quite different. Today, direct interventions by foreign powers are ruled out, but damages often come from the fallouts of these Cold Wars.",

        "Article Content": "A study published in the journal,  , has revealed that India is responsible for 20% \u2014 one-fifth \u2014 of the global plastic pollution, making it the world\u2019s biggest polluter by surpassing China and the United States of America. India burns roughly 5.8 million tonnes of plastic each year and releases another 3.5 mt of plastics into the environment as debris. Admittedly, a lot of this plastic waste is not generated by India. More than 25 countries dumped about 78,000 mt of plastic waste in India in 2023, according to some estimates, even though the import of plastic waste is banned in India. But it cannot be denied that India has a waste management problem of its own. In an audit in 2023, the Central Pollution Control Board found over 6,00,000 fake pollution-trading certificates from just four of the 2,348 plastic waste recyclers registered with it. Moreover, although India forbade 19 single-use plastic items like spoons, straws, plates and polythene bags that are less than 120 microns thick in 2022, the CPCB is on record saying that the law is flouted with impunity. Even waste that is properly managed in India extracts a steep human cost \u2014 some 1.5 million waste-pickers, including women, children and the elderly, play a critical role in waste management and resource efficiency by collecting, sorting, trading and sometimes even reinserting discarded waste back into the economy. Yet, they face systemic marginalisation due to non-recognition, non-representation, and exclusion from social security schemes and legal protection frameworks. In India, despite regulatory measures, their effective implementation and enforcement remain challenges in combating plastic pollution. Robust enforcement and ensuring compliance with existing laws coupled with public awareness campaigns and educational programmes are crucial to curbing the proliferation of plastic waste. The   study also comes at a time when negotiations for the first legally binding international treaty on plastics pollution \u2014 arguably the most important environmental pact after the Paris Agreement \u2014 are ongoing. However, consensus on what it should entail has been hard to come by. India has aligned with countries like Saudi Arabia that have plastic-petrochemical interests to insist that the treaty should focus on downstream waste management and not curb production. This reflects a blatant disregard for the scientific eviden\u00adce surrounding climate change. No country can afford to shirk its responsibility of reducing plastic waste any longer given that each person consumes a credit-card-sized amount of microplastics every week on average.",

        "Article Content": "A major reason for unemployment in any economy is that some of its members prefer goods produced outside the economy to those produced within it by other members. This is what had caused unemployment and deindustrialisation under the colonial regime: imported, machine-made British cloth had been preferred to home-produced cloth not just by the landlords but by the peasants as well, which had reduced the demand for the latter and created mass unemployment among the weavers. Now too, imported Chinese lights, for instance, are preferred by many to home-produced candles and lamps even on  day; instances like this constitute one reason for the unemployment and crisis afflicting the domestic petty production sector. The reason for such import-preference lies in the price- or quality-superiority of the imported good over the home-produced one, which, therefore, gives rise to a serious policy dilemma: should a country protect domestic production and employment against imports when such protection causes a reduction in the standard of living of a section of the population that benefits from the price- or quality-superiority of the imported goods? This is an issue on which two of the tallest figures of modern India, Rabindranath Tagore and M.K. Gandhi, had differed. (Incidentally, for any student of the Indian economy, the correspondence between these two, including pieces where they do not directly address one another, that have been conveniently brought together by Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, provides in my view the best reading even to this day). Gandhi was concerned with unemployment. He was, of course, not talking about  against imports; and the colonial State in his time could hardly have been expected to protect domestic employment against imports. But he wanted people to boycott foreign goods so that domestic producers did not lose their employment. To paraphrase him: \u201chow can I deck myself up in the finery of Savile Row when I know that my doing so starves my brother the weaver in the next village?\u201d His appeal was on ethical grounds, that the beneficiaries of imported goods should make a sacrifice for the sake of their local artisan brothers. Tagore\u2019s position, which had also informed his novel,  , was the opposite of this. If the peasantry, constituting the backbone of Bengal\u2019s rural life and acutely oppressed by colonial exactions, managed to access better quality or cheaper cloth, then that should be a source of some relief; snatching away even that relief could not possibly be justified. (He was also acutely aware of the potential for communal conflict that such snatching away could generate since the peasants belonged largely to the minority community while the political movement against foreign goods was led by an elite belonging to the majority community; but I shall not go into this aspect here.) There was in his view no pressing ethical argument for boycotting imported cloth; ethics, if anything pointed in the opposite direction, of supporting the import of cloth for an improvement in the standard of living of the hard-pressed peasantry of Bengal. Modern-day economists would leave the matter there, without sticking their necks out by supporting one or the other position. It is for \u2018society\u2019, they would argue, to make up its mind about whether to privilege the employment objective over cheap imports, or how exactly to strike a balance between the two. While they may have their own personal preferences between the two objectives, as  they would claim they cannot say anything further on the subject, especially since both peasants and artisans are poor and no judgment on  considerations can be made in favour of either. Even analytically, however, leaving the matter there is unwarranted; something much further  be said on the subject when we take a slightly longer view. Colonial deindustrialisation, for instance, while appearing to constitute  a price to be paid for cheaper imports that improved the living standards of the peasantry, entailed   a worsening of the living standard of the agricultural population. It increased the pressure of population on the available land, since the unemployment generated by it forced masses of displaced petty producers into seeking a livelihood in agriculture. As the investment for increasing either the gross cropped area or the yield per acre was not forthcoming from the colonial government, displaced petty producers turning to agriculture meant an increase in land-rents and a decrease in agricultural wages during the nineteenth century that hurt the agricultural population, the very population that is supposed to have benefitted from cheaper cloth imports. (This income effect is noted in Bipan Chandra\u2019s \u201cA Reinterpretation of Nineteenth Century Indian Economic History\u201d,  , 5(1), 1968). The main beneficiaries of the cheaper cloth imports in the nineteenth century, taking both the immediate price effects and  , would have been the landlords and not the peasants who appeared immediately to have been the beneficiaries as well. It follows that the employment objective had to be socially prioritised on egalitarian grounds which most people would accept as ethically legitimate. Two conclusions follow from this: first, analysis has to be pushed much further than appears warranted at first sight, since the full effects of any course of action take much longer to unfold; and second, the effects of unemployment are far more damaging than appear immediately, and hence its removal must claim social priority. In fact, the essence of economic development must consist not in achieving a higher growth of the gross domestic product  , but in overcoming unemployment (and underemployment) even at the expense of cheaper imports if necessary.",

        "Article Content": "A recent letter from activists and legal experts to the chief minister merits scrutiny. This is because the missive raises several legal red flags about the Aparajita Woman and Child (West Bengal Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill, 2024 that has been passed by Mamata Banerjee\u2019s government. While prescribing harsher punishments for rape, the bill, in a particular case \u2014 that of rape and injury leading to the death of the victim or the victim being reduced to a vegetative state \u2014 has recommended death as the sole penalty. This, those knowledgeable in law agree, is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court had pointed out in one of its earlier judgments that the death penalty can in no way be made mandatory; even the Justice Verma Committee, which was constituted to examine laws and criminal justice practices concerning sexual violence, was opposed to the death penalty as a deterrent. Data around the globe bear out this sound legal position. There are other concerns that plague the bill. The push towards setting up a special task force as well as dedicated courts of inquiry will not bear fruit unless these agencies and institutions are given the funds, infrastructure and personnel that would make them effective. Will such resources be made available? The bill does not mention offences against sexual minorities: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, too, maintains a dispiriting silence on this subject. The drafting of the bill, the critics have stated, could have been far more representative: the traditional practice of holding consultations with a diverse set of stakeholders, including members of the civil society, was not adhered to. Taken together, these limitations confirm that the drafting of the bill was a knee-jerk response on the part of the powers that be when they were confronted with serious public pressure to address the crisis. Justice delayed is undesirable; similarly, extreme haste in the dispensing of justice can often lead to the adoption of problematic \u2014 populist \u2014 positions that end up treating the symptoms rather than the disease. Sexual violence against women is the result of embedded structural pathologies. Confronting these impediments requires sustained, deeper engagements \u2014 well-thought-out preventive measures, reforms in policing, improvements in conviction rates, sensitising intimate spaces and people are among the necessary measures. Meaningful transformations will remain elusive as long as legislations prioritise the punitive over the reformatory.",

        "Article Content": "Sir \u2014 Entomophagy has been an accepted practice in many cultures across the world and, yet, it was relegated to the category of dietary exotism in modern societies after the agricultural revolution. But it seems that creepy crawlies are now making a comeback on our plates in an effort to combat climate change. Recently, the Singapore Food Agency approved 16 species of insects, including beetles, locusts, grasshoppers and mealworms, as fit for human consumption on the grounds that insects are healthier, less expensive, and more environmentally sustainable than meat. However, given the deeply entrenched biases against consuming insects, will the prospect of saving the planet be enough to get people to switch to a bug-based diet? Sir \u2014 The ongoing mass agitation against the rape and murder of a young woman doctor at R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital is not being organised by any political outfit. But there has been a deliberate attempt to label this spontaneous outpouring of anger as \u2018political\u2019 by members of the Trinamool Congress government. The public outburst is an expression of a lack of confidence in the government. The TMC parliamentarian, Jawhar Sircar, has rightly resigned from the Rajya Sabha citing his concerns over the state government\u2019s mishandling of the protests (\u201cClumsy and corrupt: MP quit missive to CM\u201d, Sept 9). Sircar\u2019s resignation must be seen as dissent against the malaises afflicting the government. Sir \u2014 The concerns raised by Jawhar Sircar against the TMC dispensation in West Bengal are justified. The rape and murder of a young woman doctor at her place  of work has triggered massive outrage and raised questions about the safety of women in their workplaces. What is worse, the clumsy handling of the incident and the hasty reinstatement of the outgoing principal in an equivalent position has led  to suspicions of a cover-up. The nexus of corruption in public hospitals that has come to light thereafter has tarnished the image of the Mamata Banerjee-led government. The dispensation is failing to read the public mood and employing diversionary tactics that keep backfiring. Sir \u2014 Jawhar Sircar, a former Indian Administrative Service officer and one of the staunchest critics of the Narendra Modi regime at the Centre, has left the Rajya Sabha on account of the culture of corruption in the TMC. Sircar has been unsparing in his criticism of the Bengal government\u2019s response to the movement demanding justice for the R.G. Kar victim. He deserves applause for demonstrating courage of conviction, a rarity in today\u2019s politicians. Sir \u2014 Jawhar Sircar has expressed his grievances against the TMC in a letter addressed to Mamata Banerjee. In this letter, Sircar referred to having considered resigning after the arrest of the then state education minister, Partha Chatterjee. He stated that at that time, he chose to stay on in the Rajya Sabha in the hope that Banerjee would continue her anti-corruption efforts. The R.G. Kar incident reveals how deep the roots of corruption go in the TMC. Sir \u2014 With the wrestlers, Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, joining the Congress, the party\u2019s fortunes in the upcoming assembly elections in Haryana have brightened remarkably (\u201cVinesh joins Cong, in poll bout\u201d, Sept 7). The Congress aims to present itself as a platform for the youth through Phogat and Punia. The party is keen to capitalise on the popularity of the two wrestlers, especially Phogat\u2019s after her historic bout at the Paris Olympics. Given that both wrestlers are from the Jat community, this could also consolidate the decisive Jat vote bank in the state for the Congress. On the other hand, the internal feuds in the Bharatiya Janata Party have led to several senior state leaders quitting after being denied tickets. It seems that all the stacks are in favour of the Grand Old Party to wrest back power in Haryana. Sir \u2014 The Congress had put up a united front with the Aam Aadmi Party in Haryana before the Lok Sabha elections but is aver\u00adse to such an alliance in the state polls. Perhaps the Congress has become con\u00adfident of winning after the induction of Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia. But it would be a mistake to assume that the party can win Haryana by just banking on the popularity of the two wrestlers. The AAP has increased its foothold in the state and may end up clinching crucial seats. This will divide the vote shares of the Congress and the AAP, ultimately helping the BJP. Sir \u2014 A recent study published in   has revealed that around 11 crore household latrines built under the Swachh Bharat Mission have averted 60,000-70,000 infant deaths annually. This reaffirms the link between improved access to sanitation and reduced in child mortality. Launched in 2014, the Swachh Bharat Mission has proved to be a game-changer in improving sanitation in the country. Sir \u2014 Arijit Chatterjee\u2019s article, \u201cPath of shame\u201d (Sept 9), highlighted the worrisome condition of the footpaths in Calcutta and elsewhere. Encroachment on footpaths by hawkers has become common. Chatterjee suggested solutions to the menace such as instituting a separate cadre of footpath police which would save pavements from being encroached on. This must be implemented across India.",

        "Article Content": "A sedentary lifestyle is a feature of modern living. So it is not surprising that a national survey \u2014 the first of its kind \u2014 has found that over 20 crore Indians are physically inactive. The study conducted jointly by Dalberg Advisors and Sports and Society Accelerator, a think tank and a non-profit organisation, respectively, revealed other problematic trends as well: 48% of older adults believe that they are too old to engage in physical activity like playing while 45% are of the opinion that the pursuit of sports is not safe for girls. Several misconceptions discourage women from participating in physical activities. Physical exertion is considered detrimental to menstruating women; bodily injuries suffered in the course of exercising may dent their marriage prospects, or so goes the regressive line of thinking. Such misconceptions are responsible for the wide gender gap in physical engagements: the study found abstention from physical activity is most acute among urban citizens, especially women. This is unsurprising given that 75% of Indian women\u2019s active time is spent in doing a myriad household chores, leaving them with little time for exercise. The lack of open spaces, such as parks and fields, in urban settings is another factor that can be attributed to the sedentary lives of men and women. Little wonder then that the level of physical inactivity in cities, the study found, was twice that of the rural areas. Global data are consistent with these revelations. A recent   study stated that about one-third of the human population did not meet the World Health Organization\u2019s recommended levels of activity: India ranked 12th among 195 countries with the highest prevalence of physical inactivity. Socio-cultural factors can also serve as impediments to a healthy lifestyle. One in five Indian parents, for instance, believes that children will not achieve good grades if they indulge in sports. The deleterious consequences of immobility are well known. A physically inactive population is more vulnerable to serious physiological as well as mental health afflictions. Fitness also has an economic incentive. A physically active population can boost India\u2019s GDP by over Rs 15 trillion annually by 2047. The government must come up with policy interventions to encourage citizens to become active. The provision of open spaces and public \u2014 subsidised \u2014 gymnasiums for adults and a sport-friendly curriculum for children can be looked into. An annual   day is hardly enough to whip Indian couch potatoes into shape.",

        "Article Content": "Seasons change: but what remains unchanged is the spectre of violence in strife-torn Manipur. A former armyman belonging to the Kuki-Zo community was lynched in Imphal West on Sunday night after he had inadvertently crossed over into an area that has a sizeable presence of Meiteis. Manipur has also witnessed a spike in violence in some other areas with \u2014 this is worrying \u2014 Kuki insurgents using sophisticated weaponry such as drones and rockets in the course of their targeted assaults. The rupture of the tenuous, uneasy peace has, understandably, led to the renewal of public demonstrations. Thousands of students have taken to the streets protesting against the latest round of violence and demanding, among other things, for the reins of the Unified Command to be handed over to state authorities. Tellingly, the chief minister, N. Biren Singh, too, made a similar submission to the governor recently. His other demand was the revocation of the suspension of operation agreement that is in place with militant organisations. Both of Mr Singh\u2019s demands are audacious. Given the extent of the ethnic polarisation in Manipur \u2014 State institutions are no longer immune from this vice \u2014 the granting of the reins of the Unified Command, a crucial coordinating agency between New Delhi and Manipur, to Imphal could heighten the possibility of prejudicial, retaliatory violence. Mr Singh\u2019s belligerence, even though he has failed to douse the flames for over a year, must not be pandered to by the Centre. But is the Centre keen on resolving the situation at the earliest? The prime minister\u2019s seeming indifference towards the crisis does not instil much confidence. Peace cannot return to Manipur through a dis\u00adproportionate emphasis on a securitised approach. What is needed is a consensual political resolution. But this cannot happen without involving the state\u2019s, albeit frayed, civil society. A simultaneous political and civil initiative to bridge the trust deficit between the warring communities along with the rehabilitation of the affected people   partisanship could be considered  as the inaugural steps towards normalcy. Parallelly, the security forces must also neutralise any attempt on the part of mischievous elements to reignite the flames. The biggest impediment to the return of peace in Manipur remains the pursuit of narrow, divisive motives. This kind of regressive agenda must be shunned immediately for the sake of peace.",

        "Article Content": "Earlier this month, the results of Germany's provincial elections sent shockwaves across Europe after the far-Right Alternative for Democracy won the vote in the eastern state of Thuringia and came a close second in the state of Saxony. It is the first time since the Second World War that a far-Right party has won a state election in Germany. Days later, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, appointed the veteran conservative politician, Michel Barnier, as the country\u2019s prime minister in an apparent bid to appease the far-Right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen with whose support Mr Macron hopes to run the government. This, even though Ms Le Pen's coalition came third in the snap polls in June and July. Mr Macron had earlier rejected the prime ministerial nominee of the Left coalition that secured the most seats in the election, arguing that all other groupings would together bring a Left government down in a vote of no confidence. Both of these developments, in Europe's two largest economies, point to the expanding influence of the far-Right among the continent's voters as well as the growing mainstream legitimacy it enjoys within the political system.  These are no longer straws in the wind. In the Netherlands, members of Geert Wilders's Party for Freedom, which has peddled xenophobic rhetoric, are now in government after the party won last year's national vote. In Italy, Giorgia Meloni, who once lauded the policies of the fascist leader, Benito Mussolini, is prime minister. And in the United Kingdom, Nigel Farage's anti-immigrant Reform UK won a record 14% of the vote in the July election. Unlike Ms Meloni and the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands, the others on the far-Right that have had breakthrough gains, including the AfD in Germany, National Rally in France and Reform UK in Britain, are not yet in government. But, if recent history is any guide, their successes will pressure Centrist parties to tilt more to the Right to try and claw back voters they have lost. To some extent, that is a reflection of responsive politics. But unless traditional mainstream parties actually look to address growing worries about unemployment, soaring costs of living, and insecurity about the future, it is those who speak to such concerns who will gain. The answer to these legitimate grievances, ultimately, is more empathetic, economically sound, people-centred governance that works for everyone. Europe might be in churn now over these questions but the rest of the world is not immune from them either.",

        "Author URL": null,
        "Article Content": "Sir \u2014 The list of reasons why the world is always angry with Gen Z is long. The latest entry in this list is their need to photograph airport security trays laden with their aesthetically arranged possessions \u2014 a carefully curated collection of items like vintage sunglasses, cute shoes, a travel-size perfume bottle, a trending paperback and so on. Anyone who has experienced the mad rush at airport security and the cut-throat competition for empty trays would, understandably, be irritated with such photo sessions holding up the queue. But the real culprit might not be Gen Z; it might be the ubiquitousness of the phone camera. After all, telling those close to us every little detail of our travel is not new \u2014 what earlier took hours of cramped writing on postcards to communicate can now be done with the click of a button. Sir \u2014 It is heartening that Naxal violence in India has reduced by 76% between 2010 and 2022 (\u201cMaoist death toll at 15-year high\u201d, Sept 8). Initiatives like Operation Green Hunt have gone a long way towards curbing the Naxalite violence. But parts of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha and Maharashtra are still under the shadow of Naxal violence. A multi-pronged strategy is necessary to eliminate this menace. A bottom-up approach to development and the use of modern technology like Artificial Intelligence for surveillance in dense forests, special rehabilitation packages, and building a robust socio-economic infrastructure are steps that can eradicate Naxal insurgency completely. Sir \u2014 Once again, the Union home minister, Amit Shah, has said that the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance government will free India of left-wing extremism by March 2026. But Shah had made a similar promise, albeit with a deadline of March 2024, last year. Several historical and socio-economic factors led people to turn to Maoism. Economic development in the impoverished regions afflicted by Maoism can root out this kind of violence. Sir \u2014 The recently passed Maharashtra special public security bill, 2024 gives the state government the power to label people as \u2018Naxals\u2019. One must ask why this bill was tabled without adequate discussion on the issue. Has there been a spurt in Naxalite activity in the state? If so, why has the evidence not been published in the public domain? The bill is intended to intimidate political opponents of the Bharatiya Janata Party and arm the police with draconian powers. The vague and generalised definitions in the poorly drafted bill leave room for arbitrary interpretations.  Sir \u2014 The right-wing is an exceptionally sensitive bunch (\u201cGets under the skin\u201d, Sept 8). Why is it that people on that end of the political spectrum are so unwilling to budge from their point of view or accept the correctness of other schools of thought? There is just one reason behind this: hatred is what gets them votes. The Centre and the Left also need to introspect about how to counter the culture of intolerance that is being spread by the Right. Sir \u2014 Much is written and said about the dangers of the overuse of antibiotics. But antibiotics are not the only drugs sold over the counter. Another popular medicine these days is montelukast, an oral medicine prescribed for long-term use to control asthma and allergic rhinitis. This drug has serious neuropsychiatric side effects \u2014 a British teenager who had been on montelukast for two years committed suicide after struggling to cope with mental health issues. Yet, it is widely prescribed to Indians, who, given the country\u2019s high levels of pollution, are particularly prone to lung ailments. In a country where post-marketing surveillance of medicines tends to be limited and mental health issues are largely under-reported and stigmatised, we need to raise awareness about this drug. Sir \u2014 A nation cannot progress unless its people are ready to toil (\u201cThe sloths\u201d, Sept 10). According to a report, 155 million Indian adults and 45 million adolescents do not meet the required levels of physical activity laid down by the World Health Organization. A few years ago, a Fitbit survey found Indians to be the laziest people in the world. A sedentary lifestyle makes people prone to serious medical conditions. This, in turn, has a serious impact on the economy of the country. Lazy people are a threat to global health and the world economy. Sir \u2014 Air pollution worsens each winter. It is thus crucial to take preventive steps before the arrival of the cold months when we are susceptible to respiratory ailments owing to air pollution. For instance, as we approach the festive months, we should not burn firecrackers. It is heartening then that Delhi has imposed a ban on the production, storage, and selling of firecrackers until January 1. Sir \u2014 For the swipe-right Gen Z, the thrill of surprise connections made in unexpected places might be foreign territory. This is probably why some hobby applications such as Strava, a platform for runners, or Letterboxd, an app for cinephiles, now appear to be doubling up as no-pressure dating zones. Hobby apps afford youngsters the chance to forge a connection over a shared interest before moving things to the next stage, not to mention make real-life bonds that cannot be replaced by online romance.",

        "Article Content": "The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Tuesday imposed a four-mo\u00adnth suspension on India inter\u00adnational and Emami East Bengal defender Anwar Ali, finding him \u201cguilty\u201d of illegally terminating his four-year contract with Mohun Bagan Super Giant, who are also eligible for a huge compensation of  12.90 crore. The AIFF\u2019s players status committee also ruled that Anwar\u2019s parent club Delhi FC and current team East Bengal, with whom he has entered into a five-year contract, have been banned from registering any new players for \u201ctwo entire and consecutive registration periods\u201d (2024-25 winter and 2025-26 summer transfer windows). Anwar, East Bengal and Delhi FC are all jointly \u201cliable\u201d for the compensation amount which includes  8.40 crore for the residual value of the contract,  2 crore already paid by Mohun Bagan to Delhi FC under loan agreement, and  2.50 crore for \u201cother damage suffered by the club (Bagan),\u201d stated the decision of the AIFF players status committee. , in its August 4 edition, had reported that Anwar faced a few months\u2019 ban and would most likely have to pay a hefty fine as well. Anwar, however, is set to appeal the AIFF verdict, senior East Bengal official Debabrata Sarkar said. \u201cYes, Anwar will be appealing. We will also get to know the details from the club\u2019s lawyers tomorrow (Wednesday), Sarkar said. The 23-year-old, who had played a key role in Bagan\u2019s ISL shield-winning campaign with three goals and an assist last season, terminated his contract and joined arch- rivals East Bengal on a five-year deal.  Bagan then challenged the decision by filing a complaint with the national federation\u2019s players status committee. \u201cIn accordance with Article 20.4, the Player is restricted from playing in official matches for a period of 4 (four) months, a period that shall commence from the date of notification of this decision,\u201d read the verdict.  Anwar, however, will be eligible to play for India, but for East Bengal, the verdict does come as a blow before they begin their ISL campaign this Saturday, against Bengaluru FC.",

The talks were to be held at 5pm in the presence of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee as demanded by the protesters. The CM waited for for more than an hour to meet the agitating junior doctors. However, it did not take place as scheduled. The protestors reached the secretariat around 5.25 pm, some 25 minutes past the scheduled time of commencement of the meeting, and stayed put at the venue gate for over an hour and were seen engaged in meetings even as a high-strung battle of nerves ensued between the two sides with both staying firm on their respective stands. Senior police officials at the venue, including DGP Rajeev Kumar, ADG (South Bengal) Supratim Sarkar and even state chief secretary Manoj Pant, who were seen engaged in back-to-back discussions with the doctors\u2019 delegation and other officials, failed to convince the unrelenting doctors who refused to budge. All this while, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was reportedly waiting at the venue to take part in the meeting. \"We had conveyed in our letter that live streaming will not be possible but had given our assurances that we would have the whole session recorded for documentation and posterity. The chief minister is waiting for them for the last hour and half. There should be a limit to such demands. We have tried to convince the doctors but they have still not accepted. We request them to consider attending this meeting,\u201d said chief secretary Pant. The top bureaucrat maintained that since the intention of fixing the anomalies in the health sector is common to both sides, there shouldn\u2019t be any conflict between the doctors and state administration.

        "Article Content": "A hot May afternoon in the early 1980s. Mr Chakrabarti had only just brought home his wife and the new-born baby, and he was in high spirits. But he was restless. He was waiting for someone; pacing up and down the long corridor of his bungalow in the small town of Jharia in Bihar (now in Jharkhand). At long last the large black iron gates swung open and a man drove in on a shiny grey-and-black Lambretta scooter. Mr Chakrabarti gasped at the sight. It was a second-hand vehicle but there was nothing second-hand about what Mr Chakrabarti felt. He had spent weeks saving every paisa from the time he learnt that one of his colleagues had a relation in Delhi who wanted to sell a fairly new Lambretta. They found the scooter too heavy to manoeuvre and actually wanted to give it away to Mr Chakrabarti\u2019s colleague, but he was not willing to drive a scooter. Mr Chakrabarti had no such hesitation. You see, he knew a lot about the Lambretta from his assiduous readings. He knew that it was made in Milan in Italy, that it was named after the Lambro river that was adjacent to the factory site. He also knew that Lambretta was the name of a water fairy associated with that particular river. He was well aware of the advanced mechanics of the Lambretta and was delighted at the prospect of owning such an exotic steed. He decided to give it a shot. Three thousand five hundred and one rupees plus the freight charge was what he had to pay. That was quite a sum those days when a seer of mutton cost one rupee fifty paise. The Lambretta had arrived from Delhi after two-and-a-half days on the Delhi-Kalka Mail. Mr Chakrabarti\u2019s family was now complete \u2014 him and the missus, a boy, a baby girl and now the Lambretta. He was so excited that no sooner than the courier had left, he took the scooter out for a spin. Mr Chakrabarti was a young manager at the Simla Bahal Colliery. Thus far, he  bicycled to office and back, a good four kilometres distance one way. There was no public transport in the colliery and the adjoining areas. There were no buses, very few rickshaws plied and a handful of \u201ctrekkers\u201d or jeeps could be spotted sometimes at the city centre. On Sundays, after a breakfast of luchi-torkari, Mr Chakrabarti would walk down the narrow pathway that led to the main road to reach the lone local market, Jharia bazaar, which was at least five kilometres away. So, for good reason the Lambretta was much cherished by the Chakrabartis. Mr Chakrabarti would make sure that the scooter was always squeaky clean. He also ensured that it got enough rest \u2014 so much so that in the initial days he would often walk to the office not wanting to bother the cucciolo. At home and to himself he would reason that he did not want to show off that he had finally managed to buy a private vehicle, that too only after eight years of service with the Bharat Coking Coal Limited. Years later, Mrs Chakrabarti would say in gentle tones with a soft faraway gaze in her eyes that most likely those days her husband was not quite at ease commandeering the heavy vehicle and feared that he would fall and hurt the dear purchase. Jharia was nothing like Milan. It was not like Delhi either. The Simla Bahal Colliery area was very quiet. The bungalow closest to the Chakrabartis\u2019 home was a good half-kilometre away. The \u201clabour quarters\u201d were one-and-a-half kilometres away from the officers\u2019 bungalow cluster. For the longest time, the Lambretta\u2019s sole playmate was Mr Chakrabarti\u2019s five-year-old boy. He\u2019d try to move the handles and make whooshing sounds with his mouth as if embarking on some terrific adventure scooter-back and at top speed. Gradually, the Lambretta started getting used to colliery life. Mr Chakrabarti would make several trips from home to colliery in a single day. He would go out in a fresh shirt and shorts. The Lambretta would wait for him in the shed outside his office from where it could see the two giant pit wheels going round and round throughout the day. It got acquainted with the ghrrr ghrrr of the wheel working the lift, lowering people into the pit of the colliery and hauling up machinery and men. The miners wheeled barrows loaded with coal, hoist them onto single gauge tracks from where they rolled down, reached an incline and toppled over \u2014 coal, barrow and all. The payloaders parked below would lift the coal and drop them into the waiting good trains on the adjacent railway track. At noon, when Mr Chakrabarti emerged out of the pit, his shirt would be drenched in sweat and his shorts and legs black from the coal dust. The Lambretta could feel his fatigue when he lowered himself onto its seat as he headed back home for a quick bath and refuel. The Lambretta had heard whispers in the mines about how Mr Chakrabarti preferred to supervise the work of miners from inside the pit, instead of giving directives based on second-hand reports. Whenever there was any accident, he and the Lambretta would head straight for ground zero. As he sat through the gheraos that were a regular feature of his job \u2014 collieries those days were beset with trade union issues \u2014 the Lambretta waited long and anxious hours. Their journeying continued. The Lambretta witnessed Mr Chakrabarti deal with the coal mafia so omnipresent in the colliery. Once, at midnight, a man with a dagger hovered around the Chakrabartis\u2019 bungalow. The Lambretta slunk out of the house through the backdoor with Mr Chakrabarti on its back. Only after they had reached a safe distance, did it stutter into a start, and thereafter flew to the local police station to seek help for the family still stuck in the house.     The Lambretta loved being a part of the Chakrabarti family. Mr Chakrabarti would take the whole family on rides to the local market or to some social function when there was one. The little boy would quickly wriggle into the space between the driver\u2019s seat and the handles. Mrs Chakrabarti would ride pillion, the infant clasped tight to her breast. The Lambretta was keenly aware of its responsibility to steer them safely without a bump or jerk. Mr Chakrabarti was careful but the Lambretta was doubly careful. On one such occasion when Mr Chakrabarti and his family were on their way back from a social visit, the Lambretta spotted a group of men in the middle of the road. The men were bare bodied, impressively moustachioed, gamcha tied around the head, torch in one hand and a long, thick staff in the other. The Lambretta heard Mr Chakrabarti whisper \u201cdacoits\u201d. His tone something between a warning and an exclamation. As the scooter came closer to the men, the leader of the pack came forward and signalled them to stop. Mr Chakrabarti slowed down though the Lambretta wished otherwise. It said to itself, \u201cIf only Mr Chakrabarti would shift to fourth gear, I could scamper off the main road and into the bushes and hurry them to safety.\u201d It was as if Mr Chakrabarti had read the Lambretta\u2019s mind. No sooner than the dacoit lowered his hand, Mr Chakrabarti shifted gear and raced. The Lambretta had strong and sturdy tyres and with added willpower it negotiated through an extremely difficult terrain, stopping only when it had reached the portico of the scarlet bungalow. The next day Mr Chakrabarti patted the Lambretta on its back fondly. He also took it to the local technician, who gave the scooter a thorough check-up and a fit certificate. The Lambretta stayed on with the Chakrabartis for a decade. It saw the infant grow up and go to school. Mr Chakrabarti shifted from Simla Bahal to Koyla Bhawan and then to Kirkend Colliery \u2014 both in the Dhanbad district. The Lambretta routinely ferried the little girl to her Kathak lessons and the boy to his tabla classes. And all was well till one day, when Mr Chakrabarti was returning home from office. The Lambretta had a fleeting spasm and stopped. Nothing could revive it. Mr Chakrabarti took it to the technician. In all these years, the scooter had developed the occasional problem with the starter, the gear, the brake shoe, the accelerator wire, the carburetor, but this time there was some problem with the engine. A part had to be changed Mr Chakrabarti was told and he left no stone unturned to try and procure it. But it turned out that the parts were not being manufactured any more. The technician tried to whip up a  , some local make of the missing part, but the Lambretta was never quite its old self again. After much thought, Mr Chakrabarti steeled himself and exchanged it for a red LML Vespa and, eventually, a four-wheeler. After his retirement several years later, Mr Chakrabarti shifted to a gearless scooty, but till the last years of his life he kept thinking about his Lambretta. This was years after his little boy had sped off to another world. Even after he was joined there by Mrs Chakrabarti. The year Mr Chakrabarti\u2019s baby girl got married, as he examined the son-in-law\u2019s two-wheeler, he said unimpressed, \u201cThere can never be any   like my 1030, my Lambretta.\u201d",

Not for the first time, De Bruyne was visibly frustrated during the match and afterwards told Belgian VTM television too many things had gone wrong in the game. \u201cI can\u2019t say here what went wrong. I already did that to the team at half-time,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot repeat that in the media but it has to be better in every way. \u201cIf the standard we want to reach is the best, but we\u2019re no longer good enough to get to that level, then you have to give everything. If you don\u2019t even do that, it\u2019s over. \u201cI can accept that we\u2019re not as good as in 2018,\u201d the 33-year-old De Bruyne said of the side that reached the World Cup semi-finals in Russia in 2018. \u201cI was the first to see that, but other things are unacceptable. I\u2019m not going to  say what.\u201d But pressed in the interview he did point out one problem. \u201cWe are too many at  the back. If you stay with six at the back, there is no connection. It is what it is. It is not about transition, but about people who do not perform their tasks.\u201d De Bruyne did, however, highlight what he feels is a weakness in Belgium\u2019s style of play. \u201cIf you stay with six at the back, there is no connection,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is what it is. \u201cIt is not about transition, but about people who do not perform their tasks.\u201d De Bruyne was a member of Belgium\u2019s so-called \u2018golden generation\u2019 that got to  No. 1 in the Fifa rankings and was among the favourites at major tournaments, even if the team never got to a final. The Belgians lost 1-0 to France in the World Cup semi-finals in 2018, and reac\u00adhed the quarter-finals of the World Cup in 2014 and the European Championships in 2016 and 2021. Coach Domenico Tedesco said he understood De Bruyne\u2019s anger. \u201cHe is our captain and has a huge winning mentality, so he can also react emotionally.\u201d Belgium have dropped to No. 6 in the rankings, remaining high up mainly because of their impressive record in qualifying for major tournaments. Indeed, the team was unbeaten between the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024. However, a poor Nations League campaign could cost it a place among the top-seeded teams when the draw is made for qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.",

        "Article Content": "Australia are tightlipped on Steve Smith\u2019s batting position ahead of the five-match Border-Gavaskar Test series against India, starting November 22 in Perth. Smith has been a rock in Australia\u2019s middle-order, especially at No.4, for more than a decade, but was moved up to an unfamiliar role at the top alongside Usman Khawaja with mixed success following the retirement of David Warner at the start of the year. Smith managed one half-century and averaged just 28.50 in four Tests against the West Indies and New Zealand, with the 35-year-old\u2019s best innings coming in a narrow loss to the Caribbean side in Brisbane when he managed an unbeaten 91. But with India set to travel Down Under, Australia are still undecided on whether Smith will remain as opener or revert to his more preferred batting position at No.4. Andrew McDonald, the Australia coach, refused to give away too much. \u201cThat\u2019s the question on everyone\u2019s lips, isn\u2019t it? While we\u2019ve got an eye to it, we haven\u2019t made any firm decisions around that one,\u201d McDonald said on Australian radio station SEN. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of speculation around that. But in the background, I\u2019d be lying if I said the conversation wasn\u2019t happening. \u201cThere are conversations around a lot of what ifs in terms of that Test summer that is  to come. \u201cWe\u2019ll unveil everything, and we\u2019ll let Greg Shipperd (Smith\u2019s coach at domestic level) know what our plans are and then we\u2019ll see what he does with his New South Wales side should Smith play (Sheffield) Shield cricket.\u201d McDonald is currently in the UK ahead of Australia\u2019s white-ball series against England. With Test captain Pat Cummins resting at home, he indicated selection matters have been put on the backburner for the time being. \u201cWhat am I willing to share? Not a lot at this  stage. All I can say is the conversation\u2019s happening,\u201d McDonald added. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had some chats in Sydney initially around what we\u2019re thinking for the summer, and that goes right down to depth bowling and what it looks like, all those hypotheticals and what ifs that we always go through. \u201cClearly, if we make a shift with Smith, then someone else will have to go to the top. We\u2019ve seen Cameron Green can be really successful at No.4 as well. So that sort of adds layers to the decision-making. \u201cBut nothing is firm and fixed on at the moment.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "The fourth pacer\u2019s slot in Team India is up for grabs. Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Mohammed Shami \u2014 once he is fit \u2014 are certainties. But for that fourth spot, there are several contenders and the competition is expected to be intense.  But Akash Deep, one of the suitors for that slot, doesn\u2019t consider competition to be a headache. He says he\u2019s in a race of his own.  Impressive performances in red-ball cricket earned the Bengal quick a Test debut against England in February and now a place in the 16-member squad for the first Test versus Bangladesh in Chennai. The 27-year-old comes across as mature enough to evaluate the situation and understand what works best for him.  \u201cI don\u2019t see myself in any kind of competition whatsoever. It\u2019s about being the best version of myself. If I think of how I can keep improving, the result will always be positive. Instead, if we keep seeing others as our competitors, the focus on working on our strengths gets distracted.  \u201cAll of us are different, so I never think of becoming like anyone else. I just want to keep doing my best and the rest will take care of itself,\u201d Akash told  from Bengal\u00aduru on Tuesday. \u201cEven during my club cricket days, I never used to distract my mind by thinking about playing for Bengal. Then when I played the Ranji Trophy, I would never stuff my mind with thoughts of wearing the India cap, because that puts extra pressure on self.\u201d The Australia tour isn\u2019t on Akash\u2019s mind at present. But given his progress and also the kind of deliveries he bowled in his match-haul of nine wickets in the first round of the ongoing Duleep Trophy, it certainly bodes well for Akash in terms of getting a ticket for the Tests Down Under beginning in November.  \u201c  (I don\u2019t think too far). There\u2019s still some time left for the Australia series, who knows what\u2019s going to happen then? Planning too early me\u00adans extra pressure. \u201cThe focus is now on the Bangladesh series and how I can contribute to help my team win. There\u2019s the New Zealand series after this. So, I\u2019m only concentrating on the basics that I follow, since they are the only aspects in my control,\u201d Akash said. Alongside more than 10 other fast bowlers, Akash had undergone a systematic training pattern at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru in July and August. Fitness aside, working on sharpening his skills and bowling long spells (somethi\u00adng he has done often for Bengal in Ranji) were part of his routine, with the coaches the\u00adre monitoring his progress.  \u201cBowling long spells is of massive importance. I learnt that while playing for Bengal. Even in club cricket there, I used to bowl long spells, which has helped. \u201cIn other words, my mindset has become stronger while bowling for Bengal. We all know that at one stage, cricket is all about how strong you are mentally,\u201d Akash emphasised. The away-going delivery, with which he had castled Nitish Kumar Reddy in the Duleep game, also appears to be a part of Akash\u2019s arsenal now as he no longer has to rely excessively on inswingers and in-cutters. \u201cI\u2019m working on it (away-going ball) pretty much. Moving the ball both ways makes it easy for us. \u201cBesides, the main thing is having clarity about what to bowl and when. Having more skills and options leads to clarity and helps avoid confusion,\u201d Akash said.  Akash will be reaching Ch\u00adennai on Thursday for the first Test beginning on September 19. He\u2019s certainly looking forward to meeting Morne Morkel, India\u2019s bowling coach and distinguished former South Africa quick. \u201cI need to see first what he thinks about his inputs for me... Will then see if they  suit me and can help me to improve. At this stage, fine-tuning and learning small things matter.\u201d Injuries are part and parcel of a quick\u2019s life. This speedster, though, is ready to brave all the pain and play through them. And he has even trained accordingly. \u201cSome injuries are unmanageable, but some can be managed.   (You even have to play through pain if you choose fast bowling).  \u201cMy experience says that in eight matches out of 10 a year, I have to play with pain, and it\u2019s something you get used to. I played three games with dengue during the Bengal Pro T20 League (in June). I knew I was running a temperature, but I thought when I had to play throughout the year, I needed to carry on despite the fever. \u201cPlaying despite fever was something I was practising in case I had to do so in future.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "Basking in the glory of their series victory in Pakistan earlier this month, Bangladesh are already hoping to put up a tough fight against India in the two Test matches. The series begins in Chennai on September 19. Litton Das, one of their star performers in Pakistan, on Tuesday said the team has been trying to get used to the SG balls which will be in use in India. Bangladesh usually play with the Kookaburra ball at home and the same was used during the Tests against Pakistan as well. \u201cThe ball will be a different one in India,\u201d Litton said in Dhaka on Tuesday. \u201cIt is a little harder to play against the SG ball. The Kookaburra ball is easier to play when it gets old. It is the opposite with the SG ball. It is harder to get away against the old ball when it\u2019s the SG.\u201d Litton also warned that Bangladesh can\u2019t rest on the laurels from their first-ever series win over Pakistan. \u201cWe played good cricket against Pakistan but it is already in the past,\u201d Litton said. \u201cIt is important for us to look forward... As a player, it is already in the past for me.\u201d Litton knows that the fans will be watching with great expectation but he refused to see it as a burden. \u201cIt is inspiring that people will know you if you do well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than that. I don\u2019t think it is pressure. We are improving in Tests, so we have to become more consistent in the format. That\u2019s the main challenge.\u201d Litton\u2019s role in the team as a lower-middle-order batter suits his natural game and he batted for nearly six hours to dig Bangladesh out of a hole in Rawalpindi. \u201cI have to take responsibility now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the right time. I have been playing for 10 years, so there has been some experience. I try to score off deliveries that I believe are there to hit. Scoring runs is more important these days. I think I bat in the same way that most batters approach the game.\u201d Bangladesh are scheduled to arrive in India on Sunday.",

        "Article Content": "In 2004, Shelly and Donald Rubin opened the\nremarkable   in downtown\nManhattan to share their collection of Indian art, mostly objects from across\nthe Himalaya region which they\u2019d been assembling for 30 years. From the start,\nit was different. The museum encouraged visitor participation at all levels and\nquickly became a richly rewarding hub for inquisitive New Yorkers to meet. Tim\nMcHenry\u2019s programming of speakers and films was outstandingly imaginative. \u2018K2\nFriday Nights\u2019 became an institution, and The Mandala Lab invited all ages to\nuse their breathing, sight, hearing and even smell to find greater\nwellbeing.   Now, on its 20  anniversary,\nthe Rubin is taking another leap forward. Jorrit Britschgi, its executive director,\ncalls it \u2018boldly letting go of an old model and redefining what it means to be\na museum in the 21  century\u2019, by which he means closing the\nphysical building and transforming the collection and\nits ideas into a \u2018museum without walls\u2019. This is not, as some people expected,\nsimply putting the museum objects online. It is far more ambitious, diverse\nand specific. The overall aim is to spread a greater\nawareness of the Himalaya region\u2019s culture and art, which remains little-known\neven by many people who study other aspects of Asia. And to do so across the\nworld, for free, in a variety of ways. One way is through the intellectual Project\nHimalayan Art, something the museum has started but will develop and expand. It\nhas three complementary parts. One is an exhibition of 50-120 objects travelling\nto carefully selected college locations which have related fields of study, the\naim being to give faculties the tools to incorporate Himalayan studies into the\ncurriculum for one term, enriching a student\u2019s thinking permanently. An\nexhibition already at the Harn Museum, Florida, will go to Ohio, then Utah.     The second part of this is the Rubin\u2019s\ndigital platform, where images and catalogue entries of the collection will be\nexpanded to include how objects are made, a glossary, maps, etc.  Themes such as pilgrimage aim \u2018to escape the\nnarrow way of looking at the region\u2019, as Britschgi puts it, and users are\nencouraged to suggest and even submit new content. The third part is both\nonline and published by the Rubin Museum as a magnificent book boldly titled\n\u2018Himalayan Art in 108 Objects\u2019 \u2013 a challenge to anyone who thinks they know\nthat huge and diverse region\u2019s history and treasures. Making the collection accessible to a wider\npublic is another way the Rubin will reach out its tentacles. Selections of\nobjects will be lent to museums for three to five years. As most museums do not\nhave Himalayan art, let alone a curator for it, the loans will widen and enrich\nthe host collection and will also come with plenty of information and new ideas\nfor how to enjoy them. Additionally, there will be grants for artists who are\nclosely related to the Himalayan region, and for people documenting its\narts.   Then, there is the experiential Mandala\nLab, a great success at the museum with an edition already on its travels to\npublic spaces around the world. It has already visited London and Milan. Targetting\npeople of all ages, it is usually a first-time encounter with Himalayan ideas such\nas meditation through controlled breathing, creating a sound and then listening\ncarefully to it, or experiences a smell and learning that each person has a\ndifferent response to it, different associations.     As Britschgi sums up, smiling broadly: \u2018We\nradiate out from what we\u2019ve built up!\u2019   Until the Rubin comes to your college or city,\nthere are expanding digital experiences to enjoy, too, such as mindfulness and\nmeditation podcasts including a special one for early risers. Not only are Project\nHimalayan Art and Himalayan Art in 108 Objects also on the platform; so too is the\nRubin\u2019s Spiral magazine. Meanwhile, a slightly\namended version of their blockbuster show, \u2018Reimagine: Himalayan Art Now\u2019,\nwill be soon be in Tadeo Ando\u2019s beautiful Wrightwood659 building in Chicago\nthrough next winter and spring (November 7 to\nFebruary 15). The Rubin\u2019s seminal announcement coincided\nwith  . So, when\ntheir big final show opened on the festival\u2019s first day, March 15 (to close on October 6), all six floors were crammed\nwith collectors, dealers, curators, and museum directors from around the world\nkeen to see the museum\u2019s finale, even if they\u2019d missed out on New Yorkers\u2019\nbeloved Rubin up to now.  What they saw was contemporary meeting\nancient, with a strong symbiotic effect. The 30 or so artists mostly came from\nthe Himalaya region and its diaspora. They were invited to respond to the\ncollection and had their works displayed \u2018in conversation\u2019 with pieces in the\ncollection, which not only revealed the artists\u2019 thoughts about their personal\nand collective histories, but also gave new meaning to the historic pieces. For\ninstance, right at the entrance, appropriately, is the museum\u2019s 11C sandstone\nGanesh statue from Madhya Pradesh. In front of it stands a caricature Uber Rat\nby the young ceramicist Shushank Shrestha from Kathmandu, who has just\ncompleted his studied in New York state. Upstairs, Chitra Ganesh, a lifelong\nBrooklyn resident, has made a provocative and timely animation, \u2018Silhouette in\nthe Graveyard\u2019. Using contemporary political, social and ecological images, she\nincorporates a figure of Maitraya, the Future Buddha, whose arrival will usher\nin a new age when the terrestrial world has lost its way. Visitors can look at\nthe Rubin\u2019s own Maitraya Buddha, a gilt copper alloy figure made in Mongolia at\nthe turn of the 18-19 C, while watching Ganesh\u2019s animation being screened\non the wall behind. A show-stopper fills the stairwell: a\ncascade of multicoloured disused prayer flags with horses\u2019 heads emerging from\nit. It is by VAST Bhutan, a three-artist collective led by 62-year-old Asha\nKama Wangdi, who was born in Punakha, Bhutan, lives over the mountain in\nThimphu, and earned his arts degree in the UK. The piece for the Rubin is inspired\nby the   or \u2018wind horse, a mythical pre-Buddhist Tibetan creature\nwho has the speed and strength to carry prayers to heaven, and is an auspicious\nsign of positive energy and life force. To make it, forgotten flags were\ncollected, and boxfuls shipped to the Rubin to be repurposed for the\ninstallation. The message: With more and more people seeking more and more\nmerit by placing in nature and in monasteries too many factory-made prayer\nflags using acrylic paint, the flags which should bring good are now unintended\npollutants.  Poignantly, its Rubin collection\npartner is a small, simple woodblock, which would formerly have been used to\nprint thin cotton flags using vegetable dyes.  Stimulated by the Rubin\u2019s exceptional show,\nAsia Week NY attendees galloped around Manhattan for the next seven days. To\nmuseums, making a beeline for The Met\u2019s show of Howard Hodgkin\u2019s Indian\npaintings, the majority part of a recent acquisition. To commercial galleries,\nwhere quality pieces shown by London dealers Brendan Lynch and Oliver Forge Ltd\nand Francesca Galloway, as well as US dealer Carlton Rochell Asian Art, were\nbeing snapped up by international museums. And to thoughtful shows at New\nYork\u2019s Asian culture societies \u2013 Japan\u2019s meditative Zen paintings from the\nGitter-Yelen collection, Korea\u2019s metal works by John Pai, and Asia Society\u2019s\ndisturbing expose of options for climate change action.  Not forgetting a dance through the auction\nhouses\u2019 offerings. All oiled with parties and networking.   Can this 6  Asia Week New York,\nchaired by Brendan Lynch, be matched next year? And how far will the Rubin Museum\nwithout walls be stretching by then?",

        "Article Content": " by Harit Ratna is an exploration of the spiritual journey humans ought to take to achieve self-discovery and inner peace. The book delves into the essence of human existence and provides practical guidance for readers seeking their true purpose. Ratna offers a spiritual compass for those wanting to align with their higher selves \u2014 innately \u2018One\u2019 with the universe \u2014 and therefore achieve a state of what he calls Oneness. Through this process, he says, one can \u201cadvocate for a harmonious existence free from the burden of outcomes, explore the mysteries of consciousness and evolve [one\u2019s] mind, body, and soul.\u201d In today\u2019s world, especially, there seems to be an increasing demand for activities like mindfulness and meditation that help people reconnect with their authentic selves. Ratna\u2019s book, one of many others in the genre, essentially defines the journey of the eternal soul from unbalanced existence to consciousness. By blending Eastern spirituality including anecdotes from the epics and Puranas and Western philosophy with references to pop culture like Christopher Nolan\u2019s   and contemporary findings in human psychology, Ratna ponders over and tries to come up with answers to the deeper questions of life, while also addressing them in ways that lead to self-actualisation. He assures us that the notion of Oneness that he encourages readers to inculcate is the philosophy that will \u201ctransform your life\u201d, equating them with unconditional love and boundless energy towards the universe.   The book is neatly divided into short chapters that deal with a question each. The author asks the question, gives us an answer, pinpoints examples from mythology or history and then assures readers that aping that example is one of the many ways one can be fulfilled and at One with the world around them. The concept of Oneness itself explores the idea that all beings are interconnected and part of a larger universal consciousness. By understanding and experiencing this interconnectedness, individuals can transcend their materialistic desires and align themselves with a higher state of being. The book emphasises that recognising this Oneness can lead to a more harmonious and peaceful existence. As the title suggests, one of the central themes of the book is the search for meaning and purpose in life. Ratna argues that every individual has a unique path to follow, which is intrinsic to their being. The book encourages readers to introspect and identify their own unique purpose, a deeply personal journey that requires self-reflection and honesty. Ratna emphasises the importance of daily spiritual practices, such as living in the moment, being self-aware and detaching from materialism and ego as tools to cultivate awareness and deepen one\u2019s spiritual journey. These practices are presented as stepping stones toward achieving Oneness and realising one\u2019s purpose. Ratna believes that by incorporating these practices into daily life, individuals can foster a deeper connection with their inner selves and the universe. The book may be just the pick-me-up you\u2019re looking for if you\u2019re facing a tough spot in your life or are already on a spiritual journey seeking deeper meaning. Through his exploration of purpose, Oneness, the human condition and the nature of existence, Ratna provides readers with a roadmap to living a more meaningful and fulfilled life. For anyone seeking to understand their place in the universe and connect with a higher state of being, this book is sure to serve as a rock-solid resource. As Ratna says, \u201cBe in the moment and feel the vibrations of the Universe. You will feel as though you are in the midst of an eternal embrace.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "Uncanny, gripping, and staggeringly coincidental. The readers are struck by surprise as they crack open the spine of  . They immediately wonder about the timeliness of novelist Vikas Swarup\u2019s new novel \u2014 so effective is the earliest vignette of once slum girl, protagonist Munni/Devi, a captive being threatened and tortured by a brutal goon who held her hostage. \u201cIt was just like they show it in the movies. A black Scorpio drew up next to me and the door swung open. Two men jumped out, grabbed me from the pavement, bundled me into the backseat of the car,\u201d states the narrator. Soon after, the first of her seven avatars begin, as Munni/Devi begins to bare all, as her gun-toting brutal hostage taker demands of her, that to stay alive for the present moment, she must tell her stories. The unique plot where the stories are used as auction objects to earn the hostage taker a huge cache of money, is what drives the engine of Swarup\u2019s book. According to the author: \u201cDevi represents the strength and resilience that I see in the women of India today.\u201d  What stays with the reader is Swarup\u2019s compassion without maudlin sentiment, without glamourised, hagiographical representations of the arm-candy woman. He is able to universalise the poverty-stricken slum woman from Mumbai so that she has a global reach to women in Guatemala, Colombia, Argentina, Turkey or Gaza, who echo the spirit of the courageous and intelligent woman who is self-reliant and hardworking. Named Munni/Devi, born to Dalit parents who left their sliver of a farm to come to Mumbai to realise their get-rich dreams, she has the most dehumanised existence living in poverty in a slum. The brush of reality with which he paints the \u2018untouchable\u2019 family\u2019s abjectness of sloshing in open drains and sewer water is an art the wordsmith Swarup has mastered. The quality of mercy that is so completely lacking among the rich who live in gated communities is an opulent and ostentatious contrast to the hapless, hungry, helpless existence that is Munni/Devi\u2019s daily grind. Swarup has effectively recreated the horror of loss, separation and pummelling terror that a homeless girl child must face in the hands of the rich and the powerful, in a city like Mumbai. If Swarup began his apprenticeship with meticulous portraiture of the uncaring rich and spirited poor in  , he seems to have hit his stride most effectively with  . There are three thoughts that strike the reader in the Prologue and the first chapter,  . First, Swarup has worked hard to artfully conceptualise and then mould his protagonist with aplomb, as a cheeky, irreverent and courageous girl who would be the pride of feminists like Julia Kristeva, Mahasweta Devi and Judith Butler because Devi, true to her name, creates herself to battle the  that have left her with no family. She is a work in progress for herself and as the great African American theorist Stuart Hall says, \u2018is a proof of how identity is not about being (and static) but becoming (mobile)\u2019. A girl who has no money as she is left orphaned with police brutality (apparently) killing Devi\u2019s brother Rajinder, who showed promise and acumen to have a better life, and eventually leading to the death of her parents. Second, Swarup builds a character who is mostly believable because she shows decency, grit and enterprise. When Devi\u2019s family is wiped out in the slum, she is nine years old, and she realises she will not be offered any aid from the other slum dwellers so she hardens herself and puts the trauma of loss of her mother, father and brothers aside to earn a living as a beggar. Being a street person and a homeless individual, she learns what lessons life teaches her \u2014 how to share and respect other hoodlums and drug pushers and hustlers\u2019 territory, how to keep the peace and be attentive and watchful. Swarup is careful to never make her a fantasy figure. Even as a beggar girl, Devi is real and suggests that survival needs intelligence and empathy. The third thought that struck this reviewer is that Swarup, in this narrative, offers an excellent, lucid and chronological writing style. There is no cyclical time here that smudges the past and the present. The grip the story has on the reader comes from Swarup\u2019s straight storytelling technique that is easy to follow. Some readers might be reminded of Elif Shafak\u2019s novel   and tales from the   with a delectable smattering of irony and trenchant though memorable humour \u2014 \u201cA tattoo is for ever but caste is not.\u201d What Swarup achieves as a storyteller by constructing seven versions of lived experience by Devi/Munni in Deepa, Deeba, Dasmeet, Deepthi, Diana and Dolly, is innovative and impressive. By making Munni recount the stories of her many lives, there is a certain resurrection of the mythology of the Devi in the 7th Century Devi Mahatmya of Indic scriptures. This modern-day feisty, powerful and battlefield Goddess is a clever representation of the contemporary 21st Century woman who must deploy all her intelligence, might and even guile to thwart misogyny and male domination.

        "Article Content": "Sometime ago, a member of a Facebook group on old Calcutta had posted some images of chunks of concrete that had come dislodged from a dilapidated old building and lay in a giant heap in front of it. While the humongous building was definitely in Nimtala Ghat Street, members were confused about its identity. Was it Duff College? Or was it the Jorabagan Police Station? Actually, it is both. As we arrive at Duff College \u2014 rather its remnants \u2014 our ears are greeted by the beat of drums. Some festivity? No it was a \u201cmalaria awareness\u201d campaign led by two youngsters-turned-mosquitoes like the 19th century shongs (mummers). Blocks of brand new tenement-like flats have come up in this ancient neighbourhood but it is undecided about its presence in the 21st century. Even people who had lived there for 27 generations and more were not aware that the Jorabagan thana was originally Duff College. Aloke Kumar Dutta, pallid, frail and fine-featured, is a member of the Hathkhola Dutta clan whose paterfamilias moved to north Calcutta from Gobindapur in the Maidan where the British undertook to construct Fort William. Dutta says his bedroom window overlooks the former thana, and the quarters of the officer-in-charge were also housed in the same building, now in the last stages of dilapidation. \u201cDetainees in jail custody were held in the lock-up and at night their wails made it impossible for us to sleep,\u201d says Dutta, 75, who retired as the registrar of Calcutta High Court. His wife, Dipa, picks up the thread, \u201cI too faced the same problem after my marriage.\u201d Later, when I walked down the Kashi Dutta Street side of the thana, I saw the heavily barred cells. The Duttas live on the top floor of a three-storey building made over in recent times. The staircase and floors are a brilliant red, and the carved console table is a relic from the past. A row of broad columns \u2014 quite as broad as the Ionic columns of the thana next-door \u2014 along the fa\u00e7ade gives away the building\u2019s age. The coat of rough cast plaster on the columns was meant to keep away posters and graffiti. Dutta expresses surprise when told that the thana was originally Duff College. The building was abandoned around 1985 and the thana shifted to the smaller building in front of it, which was probably the outhouse. Bang opposite Duff College is the smart red-and-cream building where Suresh Chandra Chaudhuri had founded the East Bengal Club on August 1, 1920. Rajesh Chaudhuri, 52, who had come from Delhi for the last rites of his father, was kind enough to allow me to peer at Duff College through their kitchen window. But my vision could not penetrate the pall of leaves. Chaudhuri said he distinctly remembered the Sikhs who sought refuge in the thana after Indira Gandhi\u2019s assassination. Duff College stands on a rectangular plot facing Nimtala Ghat Street and sprawls from Mathur Sen Garden Lane on its B.K. Pal Avenue side to Kashi Dutta Street. The building is so densely forested with parasitic plants that one has to view it from several points. Abandoned vehicles disintegrate into piles of rust before what is the rear of the building, and pavement dwellers have set up jhuggis on the strip outside the railing. In an entry on this institute, Radharaman Mitra had written in Kalikata Darpan: \u201cDuff College\u2019s own building (74, Nimtala Ghat Street) had 28 rooms. A thousand to 1,200 students could sit there. Besides, it had three halls, of which two had galleries; these could accommodate 450 and 700 students, respectively. It also had a library and a laboratory.\u201d Way back in 1999, I had met Alok Roy, who authored the book Alexander Duff O Anugami Kayekjan, and was associated with this institute as a student from 1953 to 1957, and lectured at Scottish Church College from 1960 to 1998. He said, in 1830, the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland sent its first missionary, Reverend Alexander Duff, to establish the first English medium school. Duff opened General Assembly Institution (later Scottish Church College) near Hedua. But in 1843, following dissension in the Church of Scotland, while this institution remained with the Established Church, the breakaway group comprising Duff and his three colleagues \u2014 Ewart, Mackey and McDonald \u2014 joined the Free Church of Scotland. Duff then opened the Free Church Institution on rented premises and later constructed a new building in Nimtala, for which he bought a plot for Rs 18,000. He raised the money through donations and subscriptions and it took about two years to complete the building. Duff was its principal till 1863, as he earlier had been of the General Assembly Institution. After his death in 1878, it was named Duff College, a name once emblazoned on the building. Rev. Kalicharan Banerjee, also an evangelist; Shakespearean scholar J.C. Scrimgeour; Sir Suren Banerjee; and Henry Stephen, who later became professor and head of the department of English at Calcutta University, were among the distinguished teachers at this college. In 1908, both churches reunited. So the Nimtala Ghat Street institution shifted to Hedua and was named Scottish Church College. Roy had said Duff may have been an evangelist but he was also responsible for the enlightenment of the benighted masses. Time and again there has been talk of restoring Duff College. Nothing came of it.",

        "Article Content": "Picture this: You pack\nup your books for the day, strip yourself of the necktie, slip into a loud\nshirt and head down to the local pub to play the guitar onstage when some older\nkids walk up and say, \u201cHi Sir!\u201d with a knowing wink. There are few professions\nthat are \u201calways on\u201d like good WiFi \u2014 one is the doctor and the other the\nteacher. It\u2019s a profession you can\u2019t escape but we have designated just one day\nin a year to celebrate it \u2014 the birthday of Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan,\nphilosopher, scholar, politician, President of India, Vice Chancellor of two\nUniversities and Bharat Ratna. His students had requested to celebrate his\nbirthday but he instituted Teachers\u2019 Day instead, to acknowledge the invaluable\ncontribution of teachers to society. To be fair, I hadn\u2019t\nreally heard of Dr Radhakrishnan before becoming a teacher in the last\nmillennium. Once I decided to teach, I got to see his half-smile on a large\nphotograph in my B. Ed classroom and could almost sense the knowing wink \u2014 you\ndon\u2019t know what you\u2019re in for, young man!  Of course, I do. It\u2019s\nfor my pen collection. For many teachers, September 5 is a day when the pen\ncollection swells. For obscure reasons, kids come up with pens of many types\nand hand them over with an enthusiastic \u201cHappy Teachers\u2019 Day!\u201d. My suspicion that\nkids relate corrections to teachers was confirmed when a few of those pens\nturned out to be red.  In my early days of\nteaching there were no restrictions on gifting and so, for some in the\nprofession, it was like Christmas. For others too, it was like Christmas \u2014 they\nsent in their Santa\u2019s wish list a little earlier with subtle comments like \u201cI\ncould really use this\u2026\u201d  It then became a free-for-all among parents\nhoping to curry favour. Most of us were glad when over-the-counter gifting was\ndeclared illegal. What teachers really\nappreciated was the handmade personalised cards that were then the only\npermitted currency! I recall a group of kids outside the staffroom frantically\nputting teachers\u2019 names onto prefabricated cards whenever they glimpsed them \u2014\npersonal enough. And then social media took over with templates and GIFs that\ncould be sent to all the teachers in one fell swoop. Till date I get a few\ndozen WhatsApps with identical creatives and messages \u2014 it\u2019s the thought that\ncounts. Paid space in specially curated sections of the newspaper ensures that\npersonal messages are published for all to see and for the newspaper to sell a\nfew additional copies!  My first recollection\nof participating as a student in Teachers\u2019 Day celebrations was when my\nenthusiastic class teacher decided that we all had talents and needed to\ndisplay them. He called it Parents\u2019 Day, in deference to the common knowledge\nthat parents are a child\u2019s first teachers anyway \u2014 they were all invited. I was\ngiven the knocking-knees task of singing   on stage \u2014\nsolo, no karaoke to help me through. As a young, teenage boy, I struggled\nthrough the lines about \u201c \u201d and\nwithstood the sniggers from the back benchers. But it stayed with me as every\nSeptember 5, as teachers, we were entertained in our classrooms by amazing\nshows of talent. I recall karate exhibitions where tiles and wooden boards were\nbroken \u2014 desks were regularly broken on other days; tabla recitals which left\nus spellbound \u2014 desks stood in for tablas on other days; and magic shows where\nthings disappeared and reappeared \u2014 things disappeared from desks too, but\nnever reappeared. Food was brought from home and that too disappeared as soon\nas containers were opened. The unavoidable classroom one-act play was literally\none-act, the same one every year. It allowed the students to impersonate the\nteachers (lovingly, I\u2019m told) with all their quaint characteristic phrases and\nmannerisms, raising nervous laughs from the watching educators. I believe it\nwas during these shows that the truth was out \u2014 true feedback disguised in\njest. Classrooms were tastefully decorated with low cost or recycled materials\nbrought from home. I believe it gave a large number of children the opportunity\nto exercise responsibility, creativity and skills that are generally lost in\nlarger groups. But all that changed \u2014 and much before Covid, which is usually\nblamed for everything.  While the class\nteachers got to be feted and entertained in their own classrooms, many of those\nwho taught in multiple classes could not visit each room resulting in\ndisappointment on both sides. So, it became more like the Three Musketeers \u2014\nAll for One and One for All. Carefully selected and curated stage shows took\nthe place of raw talent, making it the exclusive domain of the gifted or\nfavoured. The yet-to-be-gifted students never got to sing  ,\nnor display their mom\u2019s culinary prowess, and decor was contracted out to the\nschool\u2019s vendor! And it continues, in most schools, to this day. These shows are held\nfor a brief part of the morning in the assembly hall or auditorium. Teachers\nrun the gauntlet of school captains and other dignitaries lining the avenue\nthey walk through while nodding their appreciation on both sides, waving and\nsmiling broadly. A single buttonhole rose pinned on at the entrance and a tilak\non the forehead, completes the picture. The show begins, usually with an\nintroductory speech by a senior or the principal, followed by the selected few\nwhose performances stand in for the rest of the unsung talent, now relegated to\nclapping rhythmically after each item. The short programme ends with\npre-written speeches of gratitude expressed from the heart \u2014 as we didn\u2019t have\nChatGPT back then!  This might be followed by a Teachers\u2019 Lunch, managed\nby a trusted caterer, ensuring that the diners are not exposed to multiple\ncuisines. Bygone days! The private evenings, with teachers grouped around aptly\nnamed Scottish liquids, continue to this day. My memories would be\nincomplete if I did not mention one major change in the way we celebrated\nTeachers\u2019 Day. We used to have a section of employees who were known as\n\u201cnon-teaching staff\u201d \u2014 the office staff, the malis, the peons, the darwans.\nEnlightenment dawned and one Teachers\u2019 Day they were brought to the fore and it\nwas explained that they were now redesignated as the \u201csupport staff\u201d as they\ntoo teach. In multiple ways as an extension of their work. This piece would be\ntoo long to explain the several touch points at which these people teach our\nkids, but it\u2019s something to think about. They were feted and gifted along with\nthe classroom teachers that day, and hopefully every Teachers\u2019 Day thereafter. Of course, for every\nstudent there will be that one teacher who made a huge difference in their\nlives. And the debate will rage on. Should it be Teachers\u2019 Day or Teacher\u2019s Day\n\u2014 all for one or one for all? ",

        "Article Content": "Prohibitory orders were imposed in three districts of Manipur, a day after student protests demanding the restoration of peace in the strife-torn state rocked Imphal Valley. An indefinite curfew, preventing people from coming outside their houses, was clamped in Imphal East and West districts, while prohibitory orders under Section 163 (2) of BNSS were imposed in Thoubal. \"Due to the developing law and order situation in the district, earlier orders of curfew relaxation stand cancelled with immediate effect from 11 am of September 10. Hence, there is total curfew in Imphal East district with immediate effect until further orders,\" an order issued by the district magistrate said. Another order issued by the district magistrate of Imphal West said, \"In supersession of all earlier orders, curfew relaxation period for September 10 is hereby lifted with effect from 11 am of today.\" \t\"Restriction on the movement of people outside their respective residences was lifted from September 1 last year,\" it said. Earlier, curfew relaxation for September 10 was lifted from 5 am to 10 pm but was superseded with the latest order. Essential services, including media, electricity, court and health, are however exempted from the purview of the curfew, it said. The orders from the two Imphal districts came in the wake of students planning to intensify their protests demanding the removal of the DGP and security advisor to the state government for their alleged inability to deal with the law and order situation in the state. The prohibitory orders in Thoubal prevented the assembly of five or more persons as police claimed that at least one personnel was hit on the thigh by a bullet fired from among the protesting students in the district on Monday. Meanwhile, hundreds of students from various schools and colleges spent the night at camps set up at Khwairamband Women Market in Imphal. The students, in their uniforms, were helped by women shopkeepers to set up camps at the market. \"We have given a 24-hour deadline for Governor Lakshman Prasad Acharya's response to the six demands we have placed. We will decide our future course of action after the deadline ends,\" student leader Ch Victor Singh told reporters on Tuesday morning. Thousands of students protested in front of the Manipur Secretariat and Raj Bhavan on Monday, demanding action against those behind the recent drone and missile attacks, and calling for the protection of the state's \"territorial and administrative integrity\". At least eight persons have died and over 12 injured in a fresh wave of violence, which included drone and missile attacks. Later, the students met Chief Minister N Biren Singh and Governor Acharya. Student representatives who met Acharya later told reporters that they have placed six demands, including the removal of the Director General of Police (DGP) and the security advisor to the state government for their alleged failure to control the violence. They also called for the Unified Command, currently chaired by former CRPF DG Kuldiep Singh, to be handed over to the state government. \"The Monday rally was an outburst of anger of the student community over the prolonged crisis in the state. We want peace and solution at the earliest without altering the state's territorial and administrative integrity,\" another protesting student said. During the student protests in Imphal, protesters raised slogans such as 'Long live Manipur', 'Resign all incompetent MLAs', and 'Give Unified Command to state government' and expressed their frustration with the authorities over their handling of the situation. Police claimed protesting students also engaged in stone-pelting, forcing the law enforcers to fire tear gas shells to disperse them. In Thoubal, a large number of protesters, including students, marched towards the district police headquarters and DC office on Monday. \"Police warned people to disperse but the unruly mob got violent and there was live firing from among the crowd at the police personnel in which one personnel was hit on the left thigh by a live round,\" Manipur Police said in a statement. The unruly mob also damaged one vehicle parked outside the court complex. An ambulance carrying some injured personnel was also pelted with stones, it added. More than 200 people have been killed and thousands rendered homeless in ethnic strife between Imphal Valley-based Meiteis and adjoining hills-based Kukis since May last year. ",

        "Article Content": " THE OTHER VALLEY  Scott Alexander Howard  Atlantic Rs 699 Scott Alexander Howard makes a stellar debut in speculative fiction with   \u2014 a smooth-reading, intensely profound reflection on grief, time, fate, and free will that unwraps in the guise of a tender coming-of-age love story. It comes as no surprise when the awkwardly shy and reclusive sixteen-year-old, Odile Ozanne, gets chosen for the much-coveted apprenticeship programme at the Conseil that decides the merit of petitions seeking to cross the heavily guarded town borders. Illegal passage to neighbouring valleys is strictly prohibited and punishable by death because adjoining towns are not separated geographically but chronologically and cross-border travel runs the risk of interfering with the carefully preserved timeline. In Howard\u2019s fictional universe, towns duplicate themselves in an endless sequential loop across the adjoining valleys, with each town being bordered by an eastern version of itself that lies twenty years ahead in time and a western counterpart located twenty years behind. As guardians of time, the Conseil only sanctions a few escorted \u201cmourning tours\u201d after careful vetting, allowing next of kin to secretly view their beloved dead in towns where they are still alive. So when Odile unexpectedly chances upon two masked grieving visitors escorted by a Conseil gendarme from the town\u2019s eastern end, she rightly guesses that they are an older version of the parents of her classmate, Edme Pira, the funny, light-hearted boy who is also a violin virtuoso, the first boy to care for her who will, alas, be gone too soon. Weighed down by the burden of secret foreknowledge on her young shoulders, Odile can either risk tampering with the outcome of predestined events by giving a timely warning and saving her love or else be prepared to accept the gnawing of lifelong guilt and regret making her culpable in her own eyes.  The trajectory of her subsequent life is a devastatingly self-mortifying response to the choice she makes and the second half of the novel abruptly jerks ahead by twenty years to dwell on a now adult Odile who has voluntarily left Conseil apprenticeship to sign up as a border patroller, the meanest of jobs reserved only for the incompetent. Yet, just as she warms up to this drudging monotony, life suddenly comes full circle and Odile finds herself, once more, at the precipice of another momentous choice. Will she now, at last, be able to make amends for her earlier decision and redeem the past to catch her one final chance at happiness? The author does a brilliant job in building up a simmering suspense as he neatly dovetails both halves of the narrative into a stunningly unpredictable climax. One of the greatest strengths of the book lies in its luxury of details that help in adding layers to plot and character. Therefore, even though the premise is essentially fantastical, the vividness of descriptions \u2014 the ramshackle \u2018fort\u2019 hidden in the school backwoods where Odile spends lazy afternoons with her new companions, the moonlit lakeside bluffs where Edme plays for her, the coldness hanging over the Grand Ecole where she attends apprenticeship classes, the houses dotting the ends of steep driveways in the quiet neighbourhood of Chemin des Pins where she stays with her mother, or the dilapidated cadet barracks where Odile whiles away her lonely hours by carving in wood \u2014 gives the novel a realistic anchor and allows Odile\u2019s transition from adolescent naivety to mature disillusionment seem that much more credible. The ability to twist a futuristic novel into an elegiac meditation on memory, love, and loss is a rarity. Howard is definitely an author to watch out for.",

        "Article Content": "As I was reading Sumana Roy\u2019s fascinating book, another fascinating series of events was unfolding at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. During the Q&A session following a lecture by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Anshul Kumar, who identified himself as the founder-professor of Brahmin Studies at the university, pronounced the surname of the American postcolonial thinker, W.E.B. Du Bois, with a French accent instead of the English accent preferred by the thinker himself and, when corrected, refused to back off. The controversy that followed divided the thinking world into two halves. One group criticised Spivak for her \u2018insensitivity\u2019 of correcting somebody\u2019s pronunciation (\u2018Can the Subaltern Pronounce?\u2019 \u2014 many news outlets and social media posts played with Spivak\u2019s own formulation, probably forgetting it was a rhetorical question to begin with). Another group, though small, pointed out that Spivak insisted on the political charge in Du Bois\u2019 rejection of the French-accented pronunciation of his last name. It was a complicated issue involving too many binaries for our comfort: Kumar and Spivak, French and English, Dalit and Brahmin, Delhi and New York and so on. As I kept reading  , I realised that the discomfort persisted due to our own subscription to the original binary between the cosmopolitan and the provincial. Roy cautions us against this possibility early in the book: \u201cProvincials have been imagined as the other half of a binary; cosmopolitans are the head, we the feet\u201d. The semblance to the mythical origin story of the four   is unmistakable \u2014 the Brahmins emerged from the mouth of the Brahma and Shudras from the feet. \u201cWe have not minded being feet;\u201d Roy writes, probably with a wry smile, \u201cit is easier to hide one\u2019s feet than the head. The history of belatedness is, after all, the history of the feet reaching late; the head manages to reach before an appointment.\u201d Belatedness is a recurrent theme of the book, the untimeliness of a place, the undelivered postcard, the unfinished poem or the unfulfilled life. In  , Dipesh Chakrabarty famously terms this condition the \u201cwaiting room of history\u201d where all non-European histories wait for the train of progress to arrive from the West. In Chakrabarty\u2019s act of returning the provincial gaze, provincialising is akin to limiting the universal appeal of any category of thought that emerged in the specific history of Europe. Roy asks instead if it is possible to think of the provincial not as a limiting/limited space but as a periphery that does not necessarily surround a centre. Aided by a remarkable prose that is poetic, analytical and ruminating all at once, Roy interjects her narrative with childhood and adult memories, literary analysis, and life-histories of the provincials, famous and forgotten alike. The list includes Jibanananda Das, William Shakespeare and Kishore Kumar, the famous   private tutors whose pronunciations would probably horrify the posh students of private universities, the boys and girls who were discovering greeting cards in the wake of liberalisation, the two Apus of Bibhutibhushan and Satyajit Ray, and even T.S. Eliot whose attempt to hide his own provinciality was exposed by another provincial, J.M. Coetzee (how do we pronounce his last name, by the way?). Siliguri, the actual place where Roy grew up, often casts its sunlight and shadows on the fictional provincial towns like Madna ( ) and Malgudi  ). Oxford and Kishorganj become neighbouring villages. The juxtaposition of characters and places, fiction and non-fiction, plays a crucial role in rescuing the provincials from the linearity of historical progression and complicates the relationship between the vernacular and the metropolitan. The controversy around pronunciation (Roy has a lot to talk about mispronunciations in the book) can be seen as an offshoot of our preference for an easy formula of imbalance of power, which the book challenges quite effectively. Faced with the peculiar predicament of comparing the elitism of French over English with that of an upper-caste scholar over a Dalit student, we must pause and ponder how the provincial ambitions are translated into cosmopolitan desires. It is not an easy task. It needs introspection and empathy.   is a testimony to that. ",

A veteran of the alco-bev industry with more than two decades of\nexperience, Poonam is presently the managing director of Delhi-based NeuWorld\nSpirits. \u201cDrink in moderation and\ndrink to enjoy yourself.

Edited excerpts from the conversation\nfollow.   I was born and brought up in Shimla. I did my\nschooling, my college and my MBA from there. My father was very keen that I\npursue the civil services. But I always wanted to come into the private sector.\nAlthough in the \u201990s in Shimla, we didn\u2019t really know what the private sector\nmeant. I did my bachelor\u2019s in chemistry before completing my MBA from Himachal\nUniversity.  After I finished my MBA, I got a campus placement with\nBennett Coleman. I worked with the  as part of their brand management for about two years. Coming to\nDelhi was a very big thing for me. I had never seen a city as big. I\u2019d never\nseen buses that big or a five-star hotel for that matter. ITC Maurya seemed as\nbig as Shimla! After a couple of years, I wanted to switch to FMCG, which\neventually led me to Whyte & Mackay.  Not really! Whyte and\nMackay had a joint venture with Radico Khaitan and I came to know that they\nwere looking for people. I told myself that I have to meet the CEO somehow. But\nevery time I\u2019d call him, his secretary would pick up and say: \u201cSir is busy.\u201d\nIncidentally, I happened to call his number around 7 one evening. His secretary\nmust have left by then and it was the CEO who picked up. I rattled off my\ndetails and he said he would set up a time for a meeting. After that, I knew I\nhad to call him after 7pm to speak to him directly! When we met, I told him that\nI knew nothing about alcohol, but that I was a quick learner. He asked me to\nlook after institutional sales to begin with. But I told him that if I could\nmeet his yearly target, then I wanted to be moved to marketing. And I was.\nAfter meeting the target in three months! That\u2019s how my story with alco-bev\nbegan. I think it\u2019s a very\nbuoyant industry. This is an industry which is recession-free. Because alcohol\nis always going to be in demand. It\u2019s also an industry that offers you a lot of\nscope to grow and do well. Also, contrary to what many people think, a lot of\nwomen work in alco-bev. It\u2019s an industry that\u2019s very welcoming to women. I\njoined this industry way back in 2000, and I\u2019ve never ever faced any kind of\ndiscrimination [because of my gender]. In terms of consumers, more and more\nwomen are consuming alcohol, and the numbers [as compared with men] are quite\nsimilar, especially in the metro cities.  In terms of weaknesses,\nthe complex laws that govern the industry can be an issue. Every state in India\nhas their own excise policy, which governs the prices. As a result, you have to\ntreat the Indian market as 28 different countries and keep haggling with\ndifferent excise commissioners. Plus, there\u2019s bootlegging, smuggling and all\nkinds of unscrupulous activities. Prohibition of liquor mostly leads to illicit\nor spurious liquor being sold.  It\u2019s the most dynamic of\nindustries because with so many rules and regulations, you have to be smart and\nconstantly on your feet. I think the demand for\nalcohol, particularly quality alcohol, is increasing across the board,\nincluding in tier two and tier three cities. Thanks to social media, people are\nfinding out more and more about alcohol products. Foreign markets also\ninfluence Indians, which means that the demand for premium alcohol is on the\nrise. The best thing is that Indians are getting out of the \u201cScotch is the\nbest\u201d mindset. We\u2019re finally learning to respect the fact that an Indian malt\ncan be better than scotch.  We\u2019re trying our best to\nmake things more representative. But mainstream advertisements of alcohol are\nlargely not allowed. So we have to resort to digital channels and social media.\nIn any case, I think most of us understand that alcohol, as a category, is open\nto all. What happens is that the semi-premium categories are still dominated by\nmen, because they are mostly sold in tier two and tier three cities, where\ndrinking among women isn\u2019t common even today.  I started NeuWorld in\nJanuary 2022. I was the first employee, and it took me three days to decide\nwhat the company was going to be called. From there, we now have a team of more\nthan 100 people and have two manufacturing locations (in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh).\nWe have launched three products in the market (including established whiskys\nsuch as Downing Street and Royal Tribe) and the fourth is going to hit the\nshelves very soon. For me, everyday at NeuWorld is like a new challenge,\neveryday is like a new achievement.  The dynamics of selling\nall the three are very different. Beer is essentially a distribution-led\nbusiness. Unfortunately, beer comes under the excise regime, making it very\nexpensive in India. So it\u2019s mostly the strong beer (nine per cent alcoholic\nbeer) that sells. The bulk of the sales, as is the case in Europe, should come\nfrom mild beer. But mild beer is exorbitantly priced in India. You can\u2019t expect\npeople to shell out Rs 150 for a can of beer. Ideally, beer should be sold like\nsoft drinks and per capita consumption should be closer to European levels (in\nexcess of 20 litres) as opposed to the current figure in India, which isn\u2019t\neven two litres.  A lot of the money for\nbeer gets sucked in by the excise duties, and the margins for the manufacturers\nare extremely thin. This is why most beer companies from abroad fail in India,\nwith the only exception I can think of being United Breweries with Kingfisher.\nPersonally, I feel that if you\u2019re a billionaire who wants to become a\nmillionaire, you should get into the beer business in India! White spirits are\nfinding a lot of buoyancy in India, but their market share, in terms of the\ntotal kitty, is still very small. The growth is on a very small base. Overall, whisky remains\nthe first choice of drink for Indians, but vodka and tequilas are coming on\nstrong. There are many who are starting off their businesses with small,\nboutique operations. If you start a boutique company, then vodka, tequila or\ngin is a good bet. But if you want to have a pan-India presence, then it\u2019s\nstill going to be whisky. The first thing you have to do here is to get your hands dirty, to work the market. Travel extensively and try to understand everything that\u2019s happening around you. Keep your eyes and ears to the ground. Be a good listener, a good observer. Visit as many outlets as you can, meet as many people as you can \u2014 people who are relevant to the business, including distributors and retailers. Once you\u2019ve got your basic learning in place, then build your hypothesis and business plan. And not the other way round. ",

        "Article Content": "The current situation in the city gives rise to many questions, mostly dealing with whether safety for women in Indian society is still a pipe dream even after 77 years of Independence. In the 1880s, only a couple of years after Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay\u2019s   was published, Kadambini Gangopadhyay became the first woman to gain admission to the Calcutta Medical College (in 1884). Society has come a long way since then but is still somehow stuck in the trenches of animalistic pre-civilisation. Chattopadhyay, who famously wrote of India being worshipped as three different Goddesses and whose   is still sung every Independence Day, would be horrified to see what depths his \u2018Bango Maata\u2019 has plummeted to \u2014 indeed, every two or three years there seems to be an onslaught of public condemnation after a particularly heinous crime against a woman rocks the country, but actual addressing of the vermin infiltrating Indian mindset and society has, especially in recent years, been few and far between. There have been multiple books written on the subject, of course; books dealing with crimes committed against women and how either justice is delivered to them or they avenge themselves. What\u2019s more, these stories are not new \u2014 texts as old as our epics and Puranas tell of violence against women that more often than not ends in dire circumstances for either one of the parties involved. Take the women of the  , for instance. Many believe that one of the primary reasons why the battle of Kurukshetra was fought was because Draupadi had been unfairly wronged by her husbands and the Kauravas. Lanka would never have been set on fire if Ravan hadn\u2019t abducted Sita, and yet at the end of the tale she is asked to take the   to test whether she is still \u2018pure\u2019. Ahalya, lured by Indra, is turned to stone by her wrathful husband and must remain so until Ram absolves her of her curse. There are plenty of stories, across time, space and cultures, that have told and retold tales of the exceedingly damaging consequences of women being wronged. Yet their core messages seem to have been lost to time, and people only seem to remember these women at moments when they are at their weakest. For some reason, their strength and power appear to have been forgotten. Today, a plethora of women writers are reclaiming these tales. Stories are being written and rewritten to grant more agency to wronged women. Across genres and styles, authors are reimagining narratives to grant these women their own voice, essentially uplifting their stances as passive victims of fate or cruelty into active agents of change. Contemporary literature has seen an influx of stories that turn the tables on traditional patriarchal storytelling. Authors today are revisiting old myths, folklore, historical accounts, and the classics to bring to the forefront the strength and resilience of their women, who have been portrayed as marginalised for years. Take Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni\u2019s books, for instance.   retells the   from the perspective of Draupadi, fleshing out her story, giving her an identity beyond being the wife of the five Pandavas, and granting readers access to an entirely different relationship that they may not have paid attention to before.  , again by Banerjee, is a contemporary feminist take on the  , which, people often tend to forget, is also a great tragic love story. Sita tells her own tale, laced with anger and joy, mirth and sorrow, victories and heartbreak. Similarly, Madeline Miller has been rewriting the tales of Greek mythology, reconstructing the story of the enchantress Circe to grant her agency and the voice that has always been denied her. Making the subaltern speak is, in contemporary times, a literary endeavour that comes with its fair share of responsibility, but it is a task that is needed. The world has descended into such grotesque realities that if our fiction does not allow space for the oppressed class to speak up, then reality never will. Jean Rhys\u2019s   is a postcolonial and feminist prequel to Charlotte Bronte\u2019s  , reclaiming the story of the \u2018mad\u2019 woman in the attic. Bertha Mason, locked away in the attic of Edward Rochester\u2019s Thornfield Hall, is given a backstory, tracing her days as a young girl in a Jamaica plantation till her marriage to Rochester goes askew, he locks her up in the attic of his country mansion, and she sets Thornfield on fire. Margaret Atwood\u2019s   is one of the finest literary examples of women being treated as an oppressed class, kept around only for their reproductive abilities, and whose consent does not matter in the slightest.   by Alice Walker is another of those tales that depict life in early 1900s America and abounds in its female characters being physically mistreated by men. The novel\u2019s protagonist finally finds companionship in another woman.   by Ntozake Shange tells the stories of seven women who suffer oppression in a racist and sexist society. Dealing with very real issues of rape, abandonment, abortion, and domestic violence and weaving it all together to represent the universal and complex bond of sisterhood, there is hardly a woman for whom this choreopoem will not hit close to home. Tellings, retellings and fresh stories of this kind have long made themselves present on bookshelves, and that is because they are required for perusal. Because no matter what genre these stories are represented in, they are products of a very debauched society. Life begets art, and these narratives serve as mirrors, reflecting deep-seated, oppressive issues of our time, where justice often seems elusive and power dynamics skewed. Think of Gujarat. Delhi. Hathras. Hyderabad. And now Calcutta. Crimes that have taken place within years of each other, with hue and cry succeeding every single one of them, yet the cycle never stops completely. Not to mention the countless other crimes happening every other day in this country that are never talked about. Rape cases are still reported every morning, no matter what newspaper you pick up. The list never seems to end; what\u2019s more, at this point, the fear has become integrated into our mindsets as easy as breathing. But the protest for justice, for answers, for the basic human right to live without being afraid must never end. And that is why we need literature, and the arts, to tell these stories \u2014 to remind us to question, to empathise, and to demand better from the world around us. In a sense, such tales are not just tales of revenge or justice, but direct calls to action. If nothing else, they urge readers to recognise the injustices around them and to strive for a society where these stories need not exist.",

        "Article Content": "Until the moment Joe Biden fumbled during the calamitous presidential debate with Donald Trump, most of the media simply considered him a well-meaning, elderly man. But a section of journalists wanted to go deeper, wondering, for instance, why would he imply that his uncle was eaten by \u201ccannibals\u201d. The same logic is applicable to the world of science where scientists are usually reluctant to talk; but when they do, it\u2019s a cloud burst of details that are incomprehensible. Fiona Fox believes in an effective engagement between scientists and journalists when science makes headlines. In  , the founding director of Science Media Centre in the United Kingdom recounts the biggest scientific controversies of the past two decades. The SMC \u2014 based on the philosophy that \u201cthe media will DO science better when scientists DO the media better\u201d \u2014 can be considered a press office for mainstream science. It helps when important research is published because no science story is simple. The book plays out like a thriller while maintaining a mature tone. Consider Sir Tim Hunt\u2019s fall from grace in 2015 \u2014 the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine suffered a foot-in-the-mouth moment at a lunch hosted by women Korean scientists when he spoke about his \u201ctrouble with girls\u201d. His statement stole the daily news cycle, forcing most of the highly-reputed organisations he was attached with to demand his resignation.  An equally thrilling chapter unfolds in 2009, the year of \u201cClimategate\u201d, when unknown hackers dumped 10 years\u2019 worth of email exchanges among leading climate scientists onto the internet days before an important climate summit in Copenhagen. Bits and pieces of those exchanges were highlighted to paint climate science in the worst possible light. SMC wanted to put out the truth but crisis management agencies can, at times, forget the larger picture and give way to a wheels-within-wheels situation. The pandemic too finds a place in the book but the author had to race against the fast-moving developments and couldn\u2019t touch upon recent reports about manufacturers admitting that vaccines may cause blood clots in rare cases. Fox\u2019s account is refreshing, especially when she elaborates on situations that could have been handled differently. This riveting book proves that science journalism is not easy when the public demands a clear message that scientists and corporate press officers many a time push through a maze.",

        "Article Content": " FALLOUT: POWER, INTRIGUE AND POLITICAL UPHEAVAL IN PAKISTAN Salman Masood  Ebury Rs 599 The lopsided relationship between the civilian and the military leaderships in Pakistan has been a perennial problem that has stood in the way of the country\u2019s development and growth almost since its birth in August 1947. This imbalance is also seen as a key factor that has prevented Pakistan from emerging as a true, functioning democracy. The military that looms larger than life and enjoys an oversized influence over all other institutions is Pakistan\u2019s sole arbiter and custodian. But all this could have changed when an army chief collaborated with a charismatic prime minister some years back and promised to turn a new leaf for Pakistan. Alas, as subsequent events proved, they were no better than their predecessors. \u201cPakistan politics is a familiar tableau, where the script remains the same but the cast keep changing,\u201d writes Salman Masood,  \u2019 Pakistan correspondent and editor of the English daily,  , in  . The book is essentially about Imran Khan, his entry into politics as a firebrand Opposition leader in the wake of  the Panama Papers scandal that put the then prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, on the back foot, and how it paved the way for Khan\u2019s election as prime minister after  Sharif was thrown out, jailed, and allowed to seek self-exile in London. Despite his charisma as a cricketing icon, Khan\u2019s electoral victory and his journey to the prime minister\u2019s chair was smoothened by the Pakistani army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa. Bajwa became the army chief with the promise of changing the army\u2019s traditional behaviour and recasting the relationship with the elected civilian leadership. \u201cThe army has no business trying to run the government. The army must remain within its constitutionally defined role,\u201d Masood quoted Bajwa as saying in his first meeting after taking over as army chief. But subsequent events proved to be quite different. The book talks about other leaders, especially Nawaz Sharif, the former army prot\u00e9g\u00e9, his falling out with the military, the deal that he struck with the generals to return home from exile and make an unsuccessful attempt to become the prime minister for the fourth time. But it is Khan, a political messiah to the people who promised to build a more equitable and corruption-free Pakistan but ended up taking U-turns on all that he promised, who remains the focus of Masood\u2019s book. \u201cKhan\u2019s politics has become a game of whack-a-mole: every time you think you have a handle on what he stands for, he pops up with a completely different position. Backtracking has become a defining feature of his leadership style, and it seems with each passing day, he manages to outdo himself in terms of inconsistencies and U-turns,\u201d observes Masood. The crisp and lucid writing notwithstanding,   is merely a collection of Masood\u2019s published columns in the media. It is an instance of lazy journalism on the author\u2019s part as he opts for a collection of his own columns instead of a serious, political book on the contemporary history of Pakistan.",

        "Article Content": "Timothy W. Ryback\u2019s book recounts a decisive time in the life of the German dictator \u2014 the crucial months before Adolf Hitler assumed Germany\u2019s chancellorship. Ryback assiduously traces the socio-political drifts, cross-currents and evolving, complex circumstances in the nascent Weimar Republic after the First World War that contributed to Hitler\u2019s rise to power. His chronicling of the political state of affairs in meticulous detail exposes the failure of the democratic process in thwarting the rise of perhaps the most catastrophic dictatorship in human history. The seeds of Hitler\u2019s rise may be traced to the years when he joined the German Workers\u2019 Party in September 1919. He was drawn to its hyper-nationalistic agenda and anti-Semitic ideology. Hitler also got introduced to Dietrich Eckart, the co-founder of the GWP. As an associate of the Thule Society, an occultist assemblage, Eckart was committed to the theories of racial purity and the exclusive roots of Teutonic culture. Hitler later acknowledged his mentor, dedicating the second volume of   to Eckart. In a bid to expand its base, particularly among left-wing German workers, the GWP emerged as the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party or the Nazi Party. In November 1923, Hitler along with Erich Ludendorff initiated an insurrection, commonly referred to as the Beer Hall Putsch. However, the rebellion, which aimed to take over the government in Bavaria, failed miserably. Tried for high treason, Hitler was sentenced to five years in the Landsberg Prison but he managed to secure an early release in December 1924. The Beer Hall Putsch had significant consequences for Hitler and his party. Besides bringing the Nazis into national focus, it convinced Hitler that armed revolution was not the way to seize power in the Weimar Republic. Subsequently, he and his party members directed their efforts to win power through legitimate means, cunningly manipulating the political system and exploiting the democratic anomalies and loopholes. In recounting the final months of Hitler\u2019s ascendency, Ryback alludes to the backdrop and the principal geopolitical factors that contributed to the rise of the Nazis. These included the severe compromise of national pride manifest in the acceptance of the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles; the diktat to downsize the German armed forces; the consequent destabilisation of its economy and the Wall Street crash that led to the Great Depression; the soaring inflation in the post-war period coupled with bank failures; rampant unemployment, job losses and ubiquitous poverty. Making effective use of propaganda, the Nazis vigorously exploited the economic and the political circumstances as most Germans were disenchanted with the prevalent political impasse. Riding on hyper-nationalism, Hitler\u2019s pledge to restore prosperity and lost glory included promises of the elimination of Jewish financers and crack down on industrial strikes and street demonstrations by communists and socialists. In the July 1932 parliamentary elections, Hitler\u2019s party, though well short of an absolute majority, emerged as the single largest party gaining 37% of the vote. But the Nazi hopes for a majority were further dashed in November 1932 as its vote share plummeted to 33%. The dip in performance contributed to various other problems within the Nazi Party, such as the parting of ways of leaders like Gregor Strasser and Gottfried Feder, infighting within party ranks, and vandalism due to the paucity of funds. At the same time, the electoral performance of the Nazi Party also made it difficult for Germany to be governed without giving it the requisite share of power. Hitler\u2019s insistence on rejecting coalition politics, coupled with his persistent demand for chancellorship, set the stage for a political deadlock. The German president, Paul von Hindenburg, was equally tenacious in his reluctance to appoint Hitler as chancellor. Hindenburg finally gave in on January 30, 1933, succumbing to the persuasion of conservative politicians who erroneously believed that they would be able to control Hitler. As Ryback points out, \u201c\u2026 less than three weeks after the March 1933 elections, the Reichstag passed an enabling law \u2014   \u2014 \u2026 establishing the Hitler government as a legal dictatorship.\u201d Ryback\u2019s gripping reconstruction of the final months that culminated in Hitler\u2019s rise to power has unique lessons for the present day as it throws light on how the masses can be deceived behind the facade of a so-called legitimate democracy.",

Vikash spoke with t2 in an interview. Excerpts.  is based on a true story. Give us the story! This story of Dhruv and Avni was pretty much inspired by the story of my debut book, in which I had highlighted the caste issue present in this country but could not highlight certain other issues that were also part of that story. Hence, I had to come up with a fresh story to focus on this aspect. Two people, Dhruv and Avni, meet in college and fall in love, but can never confess to each other. They meet again in Goa, after four years of graduating college, and then the story unfolds. What happens after that is for the readers to find out. Which bit of the book was your favourite to write? My favourite parts are always the emotional ones. Hence, it would be the parts where Dhruv learns of a secret that Avni has been hiding from him for eight years, and the chapter where Dhruv opens his heart to explain how much Avni means to him. Would you say you are more like Dhruv or Avni? Which character was easier to write? I am more like Dhruv. I am the old-school type and I can very much relate to how Dhruv is \u2014 reserved, introverted, a one-woman-man, and someone who can wait for his love forever. The book has memorable characters and feels very   if that makes sense. Was that a conscious choice? Yes, I want to write stories that are discussed even after they are over. Stories should leave an everlasting impact on you or else one fails to bring about the change one wants to see in society. Most importantly, I want people to read more than spend time on cell phones. For that to happen, we have to tell very   kind of stories. What\u2019s next?   Well, I try to write something new every time. So, my next is going to be really different from my first two books and will highlight an issue that exists in society but has never been talked about. A hint would be, this time I will bring two love stories into the same novel!",

        "Article Content": "Every home has a story\nto tell, it\u2019s said. A home tells you about its occupants, their tastes,\npreferences, desires, a gamut of things. Eclectic or bizarre, modest or subtle,\ntrendy or traditional, the choice from the exterior to the interior remains entirely\nthe houseowner\u2019s. Writer Gauri Kelkar has put together 20 of the most\narchitecturally and aesthetically stunning Indian homes for discerning eyes. It was actually\nsometime in mid- to late-2021 that Priya Kapoor of Roli Books got in touch with\nthe idea of a large-format book on residences in India, with a focus on\narchitecturally interesting homes. I\u2019ve had some fair bit of experience of\neditorial writing focused on design and architecture, having written for  ,  , etc, so the idea of such a book sounded very\nexciting. I think the endeavour\nwas just that \u2014 to showcase an amazing collection of homes around the country,\ngoing beyond the obvious locations (big cities) and really get a big-picture\nidea of who\u2019s doing what and where. The format of a large illustrated book was\nto allow readers to really get a well-rounded insight into what goes into\nmaking such homes, to hold something solid in their hands and enjoy the process\nof reading about them and absorbing the images at leisure. Architects in India\nare doing such amazing work so it seemed like a book that could capture even a\nslice of that would be fun. I think this was\nhonestly the most difficult part of the project. The upside is that there are\nso many incredible architects doing unbelievable work in India right now so\nthis was a problem of plenty. It helped to have a sort of framework in place:\nto have a pan-India approach, to go beyond the metros and look at architects\ndoing different and interesting work in other parts of the country; to look at\nthe established firms, of course, but also at up-and-coming, younger architects\nand firms, those who are at a sort of midway mark in their journey \u2014 the entire\nspectrum; at men and women practising architecture. And arriving at just 20\nfrom what's out there was an excruciating challenge. Obviously that's great for\narchitecture as a profession. Priya and Ushnav, the editor from Roli Books who\nwas on the project, were immensely helpful with moving ahead. The huge learning for\nme is the priority given to context and location. I\u2019ll leave the observation or\nforecasting of trends to the experts but on the whole, I do believe that there\nis a certain sensitivity to building that doesn\u2019t only meet a client brief but\ndoes so while navigating the complexities of region, plot, location etc. There\nalso seems to be an emphasis on using local materials and exploring the\npotential and possibilities of working with local/indigenous craft, techniques,\nwhat have you. But the thing that really stands out is the felicity with which\nsuch local practices and materials are redefined to suit a contemporary\ncontext. So, there\u2019s this entire modern reinvention and it has led to some\ngreat work. This outlook extends\nto interior design too. And homeowners today are also well-travelled, well-read\nand open to new ideas. Then there is also the access and insights one can get\nby simply getting onto the Internet. If you\u2019re curious about something, you\nwill almost certainly find something about it online. People also look at\nluxury not just as opulence or having a lot of decorative elements but as\nlooking at materiality, indoor-outdoor dialogue, the use of art, effectively\nusing colours. In my opinion, there\u2019s a lot of open-mindedness when it comes to\nlooking at old things in new ways. I wouldn\u2019t know about\nthat first bit. I will say that the sheer volume of such residences that I came\nacross in the course of researching for this book overturn that argument in the\nother direction. In the residences that I\u2019ve been fortunate to come across \u2014\nwhich made this book possible \u2014 there is such a focus on building something\nbeautiful, functional and thoughtful, at looking at architecture\nholistically\u2014not just slapping on a typical plan on any kind of plot. But yes,\nthere is no denying that there is a tendency to do that too, to not look beyond\nthe obvious when it comes to aesthetics (or just the notion that one should\nstick to a certain idea of luxury and not look any further). There are also big\nchallenges vis-\u00e0-vis urban planning, overcrowded cities and climate crises that\nmay have to be dealt with. That deserves a deeper analysis perhaps in really\nunderstanding that aspect of things and how it impacts the aesthetics of\nbuilding. So in that background,\nyou\u2019re probably right; these homes in the book really do serve as a source of\nhope for current and future ways of building, as a way to balance aesthetics\nand functionality. We should be so lucky that they become more and more the norm! Well, again I wouldn\u2019t\nwant to get into trends but from what I have gleaned, context and location,\nlocal materials, a new way of looking at luxury, what a comfortable home means,\nall are now important considerations. And yes, I think sustainability will play\na part considering we\u2019re currently facing a pretty big fallout of climate\nchange. Also, more and more people are coming around to the idea that being\ngentle on the environment, making design/decor choices based on that, doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily mean compromising on personal comfort or aesthetics. And clearly,\nif these homes are any indication, it is certainly achievable. I wouldn\u2019t even know\nwhere to begin! It was why this book has been such a challenge. Sticking to\njust 20 beautiful across India was very difficult. I\u2019d say there are too many\nto count \u2014 and isn\u2019t that an amazing thing for architecture in India?",

        "Article Content": "Celebrated Anglo-French poet and writer Cecile Oumhani has journeyed to France, Canada, Tunisia, England and much of Europe. She has a strong Indian connection, with her mother being born in India. With her powerful, innovative narrative style that uses memory to recreate the past and weave it into the chuffed fabric of her life and her mother\u2019s, Cecile intersects her family history with the history of the two World Wars and the current tsunami of conflicts. As a writer who sees the world with compassion and grace, she has earned herself a place in world literature with  , a collection of short stories. Excerpts from an exclusive interview. Your deeply entrenched poetic vision is evident from the first page of your book. At the beginning of this project, how did you think about shifting gears from one genre to another? How easy was the telling? Ever since I was a child, the written word has been a source of fascination. It was always like picking a pebble in a brook, gazing at its changing colours, turning it over and over again for days on end. Whether I am writing a poem, a short story or a novel, the music of words plays an essential part. It is also true that shifting from one genre to another was a challenge, especially at the beginning. The different voices in fiction, all the facets of everyday reality made it necessary to distance myself from a solely meditative relationship with words. Like in a symphony, each musical instrument has its own score. You will find for instance that the matter-of-fact tone of one character enhances passages by contrast; a little like different colours on a painting. You\u2019ve dedicated this book to your mother, Madeleine. Could you tell the reader your earliest memories of her which are not in the book? Madeleine followed her French husband from Edinburgh to the French provinces, where she spent the rest of her life. Leaving our house to go to school was like crossing an invisible border between two worlds. She was perceived as an outsider and so was I. Our home was a mix of Scotland, Belgium and India. The girls at school had never heard of the curries that she loved cooking. She very often told us about her  She was born in Guntur in 1920 and was sent to boarding school in Aberdeen in 1927. She only saw her parents once every two or three years. They finally returned to Europe shortly before World War II broke out and her dream of family life starting anew never materialised. They all emigrated to Canada in the 1950s. Throughout her life, Madeleine waited for letters from her family. I will never forget how she sat us around the table to read the letters sent by our Canadian family. In one of your stories, I could actually feel the grey dust on the facade of buildings in old Paris. Could you speak about this remarkable connection between place/ space and memory? Our family was scattered around the world. I have so many memories of different places and houses and some no longer exist today. My dreams sometimes take me back to these lost worlds and so can the written word. Places have a materiality of their own that we certainly feel more intensely during childhood. It is especially moving to find that what is no longer reachable still exists in a different dimension. The written page is a space where we can retrieve the past and try to understand what puzzled us and escaped us. Our inner worlds are constantly in the making\u2026 age and experience reshape our memories and place them in new perspectives. Your style is imagistic and the meticulousness with which you capture the essence of an emotion or a space reminds me of some of Marcel Proust\u2019s essays, especially on memory. Could you tell the reader how retrieving memory happens for a writer? The world around us holds precious moments. Too often we are absent-minded, too preoccupied with irrelevant things to realise what we have just missed. This may have to do with memory and the past, but also with characters, stories we may meet for the very first time, just walking across the street. One of my novels was inspired by the face of a woman I saw at the airport in Budapest. I was on my way to a poetry festival in North Macedonia, not very long after the end of the wars in former Yugoslavia. I only knew that this young woman was flying to Sarajevo or Pristina. I was struck by her sadness. I could not stop thinking of her until I finished writing a new novel, which was an attempt to understand what filled her eyes. I loved the opening story, The Summer We Went to Canada. Through nostalgia, you very adeptly gesture towards the current situation with migration, refugees, resettlement and diasporic dilemmas. My parents passed on two different cultures to me. My family lived on different continents. Separation, not being able to share important moments, and coping with loneliness are painful. But I am so grateful to them for the two languages they gave me. They also made it easy for me to feel at home in different countries and places, and learn other languages. Identity is always in a state of flux, I agree with you. But this constant movement is also synonymous with new perspectives and horizons. I deeply believe in resilience and the role it plays in creation. Arts and literature are fabulous continents where we can try and come to terms with these secret wounds. You being a wonderful amalgam of European cultures and then being married to a Tunisian makes you eminently suited to talk about multiculturalism. Do you think it has not worked? Or has it? Where and why has it failed? We are going through dark, scary times. I so wish people remained open-minded and tolerant, eager to learn from the other. Our planet is under threat, and it is urgent to stand by each other as human beings to try and face the challenges, more than ever before in the past. We have no other option but to face them beyond any borders if we want humankind to survive. I find, as a professor of English, both at the University of Toronto and now Loreto College, the young undergraduate and graduate students hardly read, especially poetry. As a poet and professor, what do you think we can do to promote reading among young scholars? I also find that in France young people read less than before and especially poetry. Teachers and professors often complain about this. I personally think that meeting students, even high-school students, can play a great role in changing their attitude toward books and reading. I am regularly invited to hold workshops in high schools. Some students find poetry intimidating at first but soon become enthusiastic once they have started. I remember one high school not far from Paris, where a small chapbook is published at the end of the year, with a poem by each of the participants. It also gives them the opportunity to meet the publisher and learn about publishing and editing. What do you think was the most challenging part about writing Like Birds in the Sky? How long did you take from idea to submission? I felt the urge to write Like Birds in the Sky in my mother\u2019s English \u2014 the language she spoke to us, the language of the books she read to us. It was a challenge and at the same time, I discovered a part of myself that had always been there but did not really know. Each language is a specific way of relating to the world, of inhabiting it. And patterns do tend to repeat themselves. My daughter has lived in New York for many years and these stories came as I travelled across the Atlantic to stay with her, often for long periods of time. One generation after my mother, I have decided not to spend my life waiting for letters but to write my own imaginary letters to bridge the oceans between us. What\u2019s your next project? Each book carries another one that is already yearning to be born. The publication of Like Birds in the Sky has led me closer than ever before to a novel inspired by my mother, her childhood in India, and her inner exile.",

        "Article Content": "The name, Cleopatra, evokes images of grandeur, seduction, realpolitik and the absolute power wielded by Egypt\u2019s greatest queen who brought Roman legions to heel and enticed their greatest dictator and general to bed. Immortalised in literature, music and numerous films, the legend of Cleopatra VII, supposedly ending her life with an asp clasped to her breast, further burnishes the aura of a person whose stories and purported mannerisms have captivated imaginations across the ages and continued to fuel myths and caricatures alongside historical research and archaeological discoveries. Yet, she was only one of seven powerful queens, the last of their line, who dominated the normally patriarchal domain of politics and warfare through chutzpah, charm and cunning. Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones\u2019s insightful book narrates chronologically the stories of these seven queens, each of whom furthered the Ptolemaic dynasty\u2019s power and hold over Egypt before it was subsumed into the Roman empire. Engagingly written, the book reveals the heady conquests, unstinted ambitions and unique vision of these Egyptian queens that helped them break the mould and create their own legacies. The Cleopatras\u2019 histories arise from and are underlain by complex blood-relationships, multiple instances of royal incest, and the keenness of the Ptolemaic rulers to avoid hypogamy by forging marital ties within a select social circle in keeping with their identities as Hellenistic dynasts. It was through these complex and intertwined strands of filial relations and kinship, which often nurtured secret cliques, begat betrayals, and engendered palace coups, that these women of the royal household subverted the established patriarchal pharaonic monarchy, overcoming inept or infantile male co-rulers to court and align with diverse political entities, encourage and entrap allies and enemies alike, while continually adjusting and shifting their strategies. Each queen paved the path for her successor to dominate even more widely and ruthlessly, culminating in Cleopatra VII nearly overcoming the Roman empire to rule supreme across the ancient world, thereby earning the moniker of antiquity\u2019s most crafty, celebrated or reviled queen. Ironically, the first Cleopatra, Syra, hailed from modern-day Syria and only entered Egypt through a marriage alliance to Ptolemy V to quell the wars between the Seleucids of Asia Minor and the Ptolemies ruling the Nile valley. After her husband\u2019s poisoning, as queen-regent, she outranked the pharaoh by ruling over both Upper and Lower Egypt. Her daughter, Cleopatra II, married her full-blood brother, Ptolemy VI Philometor. They were equally Egypt\u2019s god-king and goddess-queen before becoming pharaohs in their own right. Their daughter, Cleopatra III, ascended the throne on the death of her uncle-husband and styled herself as a revered goddess. But running feuds over rulership with her son eventually precipitated her murder, even as her enforced divorce of Cleopatra IV caused further estrangement. These and other events would lead the realm into slow decline despite the steadfastness of Cleopatra V, Berenice III, who held Ptolemy X\u2019s reign together even though her own rule was brutally terminated. Thereafter, Cleopatra VI, Tryphaina, kept the throne warm for the Cleopatra that history most remembers, Cleopat\u00adra VII, whose own ascension to rule and machinations for power have become legendary principally because of her dealings with Julius Caesar and Marc Antony and the ensuing wars with Rome and with Octavian that finally extinguished her reign and lineage. Llewellyn-Jones contends that while these seven Cleopatras were disparate in their individual personalities, each reflecting the social mores of her time, their interlinked histories and unified abilities of queenship as female figureheads denote them as significant shapers of the Hellenistic political landscape. The narratives and legacy associated with the most famous of them, Cleopatra VII, is thus best understood through the powerful familial and female context that created her. The contextualised and entwined timelines and lucidly-related spatiality of unfolding historical events within Egypt and around the Mediterranean make the book a valuable addition to the field. Detailed family charts, maps and bust photographs of the different Cleopatras are insightful inclusions.",

Matilda might have left Earth behind but it has taken racism and violence along. For life on Matilda is governed by the colour of one\u2019s skin: the light-skinned people live on the upper decks and have every facility at their disposal, while the lives of the ones with darker skin on the lower deck are defined by deprivation, forced labour, pain, and punishment. The book opens with Aster, a low-decker with the knowledge of healing, amputating the foot of a young boy without proper facilities. Things have been worse lately due to constant blackouts in the lower decks. This, along with the fact that the ship\u2019s current ruler has fallen sick, reminds Aster of the time when her mother had died soon after giving birth to her. She tries to find the connection between these two deaths and the malfunctioning of the ship\u2019s power source with the help of Theo, the surgeon-general of the ship, and Giselle, another young girl from her own deck with whom Aster shares a complex relationship. The systemic and systematic violence that the lower-deck people suffer is closely modelled on the cruelty faced by the slaves in Antebellum South. There exists a strict code of conduct and hierarchy on Matilda which doesn\u2019t leave space for transgression. But then there are characters like Aster and Theo who aren\u2019t limited by the strict binaries of gender. Aster, for instance, is a Tarlander and \u201cTarlander bodies did not always present as clearly male and female\u201d; Theo, too, is \u201c[a] queer. Not a man or how a man\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d This gender fluidity adds another layer to Solomon\u2019s complex narrative and to the power struggles within. The book is rich in detail, but the overall mood is one of bleakness. It would also require familiarity with life in the Antebellum South to appreciate the nuances of Solomon\u2019s world-building.",

        "Article Content": " BLUE RUIN  Hari Kunzru Simon & Schuster  Rs 699 B , Hari Kunzru\u2019s seventh novel, takes us through the radical conceptualism that gripped art in Britain in the Nineties. Much like his other novels,   investigates in great detail the stink of wealth and the divide it creates among people. It is another pandemic novel that studies alienation and makes us realise that it wasn\u2019t just the virus that inflicted isolation on us. The narrator, Jay, is seen delivering groceries in his rundown car which he also uses as his home. His derelict vehicle is a reflection of himself \u2014 battered, bruised, and stricken by poverty and suffering. We learn that Jay has been shuffling about for years without a concrete career, skipping from kitchens to construction sites, and even working inside industrial storage tanks breathing in toxic fumes. His delivery destination turns out to be a palatial house, which, in its modesty, was \u201ca sign of unimaginable luxury.\u201d What shocks him is who he meets \u2014 his erstwhile lover, Alice, glowing and radiant with \u201cthe kind of health that\u2019s made of yoga and massage and raw juices and money.\u201d We are made acutely aware of the gaping distance created between them by time and by wealth. Twenty years earlier, Jay had been an art student in London, self-conscious about his paintings and his mixed ethnicity, ostentatious in his earnest effort to make a solid career. His first, and perhaps closest, friend then had been Rob, who was slick in his wealth and confidence as an artist. Together they moved through university and art, Jay always acutely conscious and insecure about his imagined inferiority to Rob. They met Alice together at a Shoreditch pub and, shortly after that, Jay and Alice became lovers. Twenty years later, Jay has passed through a hazardous journey only to find out that Alice and Rob are now married, their isolation pod being the house where Jay encounters her again. Jay\u2019s involvement with art is showcased as a bitter development. The earnest boy who began with his \u201chistrionic\u201d drawings gradually grows into this dour pessimist, drowning in drugs and alcohol, disillusioned and melancholy. He progresses from canvasses to installations and performance arts and, riding on the craze for controversy, manages to make a name for himself. Unfortunately though, he is consumed by his art. It wrecks his life and forces him through the blue ruin on to Alice\u2019s doorstep. When Jay reaches, he has caught the virus, and in his weakened state and vulnerability, cannot refuse Alice\u2019s offer to hide him in a barn on the sprawling property. After days of convalescence, he is finally discovered by one of the people with whom Alice and Rob are living, Marshall. Marshall promotes Rob\u2019s art and it was his relationship with the owner of the property, Greg, that gave them the opportunity to isolate there. Jay gradually learns that the gloss of wealth that exudes from Alice is, in reality, an illusion. Rob remained his flashy self, irresponsibly spending his money and being promiscuous, while Alice cleans up his \u201cmesses\u201d. Their relationship is at a precarious stage and Jay\u2019s arrival threatens its fragile foundation. Kunzru captures the art scene of Nineties\u2019 London with precision. Artists sitting around in dirty, squalid spaces, squatting illegally, are shown to be rude and critical. However, those same artists strive to create pieces of art out of the filth of their lives that would appeal to the rich as bold and aggressive comments on themselves and their viewers. While the part of the novel that journeys through this phase and shows us Jay\u2019s self-destruction is engaging, the latter part that brings to us the current lives of the characters is surprisingly mundane. It sits uncomfortably in the narrative, common and uninteresting in its predictability. There isn\u2019t much left to recover after that. The story rushes to its uneventful end, leaving a lingering but faint hint of the brilliance which it had promised to deliver in the beginning.",

        "Article Content": "Can a Hindu and a Muslim be friends or lovers in South Asia? Apparently yes and no; history is replete with instances of close friendships, licit and illicit unions, resistance, and violence at instances of transgression. Curiously, we have very little work on the lived experiences of friendship and intimacy barring allusions to the syncretic culture that developed historically at the popular level of Hindu-Muslim interactions exemplified in poetry and music. We also know relatively little about the shared experiences of Hindu-Muslim theologies, not to speak of the everyday encounters in contemporary times when identities have been polarised and have solidified along the lines of religion and vote-bank politics. Yet, amidst this churn, we have instances of friendship that transcended community networks as well as stories of love, desire and intimacy the analysis of which is the focus of Ashis Roy\u2019s book. Roy attempts a psychoanalytic study of Hindu-Muslim intimacies based on interviews and ethnographies of couples. He calls these \u201cpsycho-biographies\u201d that are intended to reimagine and preserve Hindu-Muslim affinities. One may well ask whether such an individual biographical approach, while offering important nuances, is adequate to understand and analyse structural factors. Looking at individual experiences of love, desire and mingling is important but do these really tell us about larger community sensibilities and the apparent hold religious identities have on collective social behavior? Also, how does a psychoanalytical approach complement or contradict other perspectives? These are some questions that stay with the readers as they navigate the real-life experiences of couples faced with extraordinary challenges, forcing some to attempt suicide and others to reimagine a completely different identity. The making, unmaking and remaking of identities seem to lie at the core of this book. Prefacing the biographies is a detailed review of the theoretical scholarship on identity construction drawing largely from the American psychoanalyst, Erik Erikson. Identity construction is seen as an ongoing process of negotiations between individual desires and community expectations. There is also the concept of \u2018negative identity\u2019, which encapsulates all those community values that are despised, the experience of which leads to irreparable alienation. It is this idea that undergirds Roy\u2019s analysis of the psycho-biographies. The Introduction also reviews the existing work on desire and love and considers a selective application of some of the theories on the experiences of couples interviewed. As such, the interviews are far more than a mere record of desire and its vicissitudes. They tell us a lot about families, their structures, modes of socialisation and ambiguous expectations. It is here that the work is rich and valuable for those interested in understanding and unravelling the strange intimacy of and ambiguity in Hindu-Muslim encounters. In one case, we see Karuna\u2019s father, who had an appreciation of Islamic culture because of his fascination with the Bengali poet, Kazi Nazrul, and who had exposed his daughter to Urdu and to things Islamic, fiercely contesting her involvement with Muslim men, one of whom she married and who turned out to be disloyal. There is also the case of Sunaina and Qasim whose intimacy had to withstand the assaults of a disapproving family resulting in the experience of a total loss of faith by the couple. There are also a few stories of hope and regeneration. Renu and Aseem are a couple who not only share an inter-faith bond but also create a space for other couples who face antagonism and hostility. Their experience results in the creation of a safe space and a secular language of ideals and faith expectations. The experiences seem all the more remarkable because the couples in question come from very different backgrounds but share a similar alienation from their value system. In all the stories, we have expressions of deep individuality which are analysed in accordance with the theories that the author is familiar with and, in the process, a psychoanalytical explanation is offered. However, the extent to which these insights can be integrated within a sociological and anthropological explanation is not very clear. On the other hand, the study is an important corrective to the proliferation of hate narratives that have dominated our public discourse. Assailed by allegations of love  , we have forgotten to concede space to love and desire which can be simultaneously transgressive and enabling. The work rehabilitates love and reveals the conversations and the negotiations between love and prejudice, between intimacy and alienation, to tell a deeply human story. Deploying the idea of negative consciousness, Roy argues that being intimate with the Other can occur simultaneously with unawareness about the Other.",

        "Article Content": "Sreemati Mukherjee\u2019s exploration of 19th-century Bengal\u2019s literary historiography is a compelling narrative that delves into how women subverted and transcended cultural norms, redefining notions of agency and power. Influences such as Mary Wollstonecraft's   (1792) and James Mill's   (1817) inspired the male intelligentsia, paving the way for a renaissance of women\u2019s spirits in literature, culture, society, and politics. This period marked a defining moment in Indian history, particularly for Bengali women. Traditionally, writing in polemics, travel writing, and autobiography were domains reserved for learned men. However, Kailashbasini Devi\u2019s   ( , 1863), Rassundari Devi\u2019s autobiography,   ( , 1876), Binodini Dasi\u2019s   ( , 1913), and Krishnabhabini Das\u2019s travelogue,   ( , 1885), disrupted established literary traditions. These texts mark the emergence of Bengali women as the authors of their own histories. Mukherjee\u2019s work is not just an examination of these texts but also an exploration of broader questions. What is an autobiography? What does it reveal about social conditions and the stature that made it possible? Mukherjee terms this period as marking the \u201cinaugural moment in outstanding efflorescence\u201d in women\u2019s writing. The four texts she discusses are not merely representations of women's lives but have influenced and inspired generations since. Their works grant courage and faith to women to chart their literary histories, embark on their quests for knowledge and self-realisation, unencumbered by gendered upbringings, towards genuine self-actualisation and articulation of experiences. A notable aspect of women's writing during this period is in the realm of performance studies. Binodini Dasi\u2019s meticulous accounts of theatre practice \u2014 her engagement with dramatic works of both the East (Sri Chaitanya) and the West (Shakespeare) \u2014 are significant. Her narratives highlight the struggle to overcome societal shackles, especially for those occupying the margins of society. Mukherjee's work also sheds light on the dichotomy faced by women trapped in and deprived by the nexus of religion, caste, and society contrasted with the more positive influences of British women who enjoyed freedoms of thought, speech, mobility, and writing. This autonomy, once reserved for men, began to be extended to women through the pioneering efforts of figures like Kailashbasini Devi, Rassundari Devi, Krishnabhabini Das, and Binodini Dasi (more popularly known as Noti Binodini); the latter two had different moulds and sensibilities influenced by their privileges and opportunities for learning. Mukherjee\u2019s book ensures that these incredible voices and stories do not get buried in the annals of history. While those without a background in literary studies and exposure to critical theory might find the text conceptually dense, Mukherjee's narrative is gripping, filled with human stories that are awe-inspiring and that serve as a testament to the spirit of human resilience and determination. The book is a tribute to the enduring strength of women who dared to defy the norms of their time.",

        "Article Content": "The first time I heard the poetic charm of Cecile Oumhani flowing through the digital feed was during the Covid years, when many of us found ingenious ways of reaching out to writers and artists across puddles and ponds. On a balmy night as Cecile joined Basant Rungta\u2019s serious poetry adda Srijan, by hybrid mode, to speak about the great Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, Cecile\u2019s voice was magical. I recall the transformative lines she recited which still push their way through like a sledgehammer at times when I see the brutality that punctuates world news today. \u201c .\u201d Oumhani\u2019s newest book,  , a collection of cleverly constructed short stories, has an ethereal quality. The anthology has the allure of a lapidarist\u2019s best piece of jewellery \u2014 intricately designed, meticulously crafted \u2014 that captivates the reader with a burst of joy. The clutch of nine short stories \u2014  ,   and   are dedicated to Cecile\u2019s mother, Madeleine, who is the moving spirit in the collection. As a child, Madeleine was extremely sensitive to war, separation and the fissures and fragmentation that came with two World Wars and a barrage of conflicts between communities in Europe. Her daughter, Cecile, takes on this mantle of sensitiveness to conflict and war. Many of the images that stay with the reader are the horror-stricken eyes of human beings who have been through slaughter. The constant attempt of the adventurous writer to play fast and loose with memory is a strategy that might remind us of a cinematic style where an object of memory like the Indian carpet Cecile sits on in her grandparents\u2019 garden in rural France as an infant, years later becomes her magic carpet to ride off on the wings of imagination. Memory is at once a great engine for tripping on nostalgia, and also a means to negotiate the indeterminate relationship between the past and the present. Oumhani is a master of constantly creating a web and her simple statements, though lucid, signpost a formidable mind. She connects the carpet of her infancy to the safe landing of this book in the hands of a publisher in India. As she teasingly says: \u201cNor did I know that a book with pieces related to them would ever be published in India, bringing me deep joy. Human lives are like a fabric woven of traces and shadows whose presence we are often unaware of. The written word is one way of reclaiming them.\u201d She has a light touch of a consummate artist who conjures a dreamlike space where the reader is gently ushered in, and occasionally that dreamscape is fissured with reality like a hyena gnawing at the heels. She grew up on Indian curries since her mother was born in Guntur and she has a passion for Satyajit Ray\u2019s films. She loves Rabindranath Tagore and has a strong leaning towards traditional Indian art and the art of rangoli. It is easy to see that she has developed a global soul and her understanding of the human condition gives her a certain universality. Cecile\u2019s stories speak of the desperation and despondency that war brings, but her remarkable ability to find hope and a strange force of calmness makes her a formidable force in world literature. She has developed a literary persona that celebrates the divine feminine in the profane reality of the daily grind. With a trend of Manish Gaekwad with his biography of his mother in  , Radhika Oberoi with her innovative celebratory novel  , and Saikat Majumdar\u2019s thought-provoking novel  , Cecile is on a trailblazer\u2019s track to enrich the burgeoning new department on stories about mothers.",

        "Article Content": "Sahana Ghosh\u2019s book presents a disturbing picture of the dehumanisation of life in a borderland. Her study area is North Bengal, broadly the territory that once constituted the princely state of Cooch Behar. At the time of Partition, the Rajbangsi population there wanted the kingdom to remain an independent country but ended up being divided by the Radcliffe Line drawn to separate Hindu and Muslim territories to be awarded to India and Pakistan. Ghosh\u2019s ethnographic approach is to live with and attempt to understand the life of the people on either side of the borderland. Her convincing narrative argues that the degradation of life here is not because of any singular event but the residue of many tiny injuries. This \u201cfriendly\u201d international border, now fenced and guarded, becomes not just a physical barrier. It is also shown as having splintered a natural economic region besides evoking nostalgia for a sense of community and kinship. Invisible to the outside world, the residents have had to acclimatise and reinhabit constantly churning social spaces. The Westphalian State\u2019s idea of national territory and security is shown to be in sharp contrast with the people\u2019s understanding of traditional livelihoods and economic connectivity. On the Indian side, this is manifest in the bewilderment of Hindi-speaking Border Security Force personnel at the disinclination of the people to stick to their side of the border. This bewilderment is reciprocated by the sense of alienation among the Bengali-speaking peasantry who have difficulty communicating in Hindi. Traditional trade chains get silently calibrated against scales of legality and morality. Hence, the trade in the cash crop, tobacco, which grows on either side of the border, continues without guilt even though it amounts to smuggling.  , also a traditional cash crop grown in Rajbangsi homes, gets past the guilt screen too. However, some would not touch cattle trading for this is seen as immoral. Gainful employment avenues are scarce and young men are expected to look for employment in cities. Those who do suffer the stigma of being illegal immigrants at their workplaces; those who remain behind are constantly fearful of being seen as informers of the neighbouring country. SIM cards of both countries work on either side and there is nothing illegal about their transborder usage; yet, people are fearful of possessing the SIM card of one country in the other. Even marriage prospects are warped. Young men are increasingly finding it difficult to get brides from settlements away from the borderland; likewise, dowries expected from young women wishing to marry away from the borderland become prohibitive. The book is a call for people to open their eyes to the twilight world of borderlands transformed grotesquely by these numerous tiny cuts. The plight is summed up in the foreboding verdict of a BSF personnel interviewed by the author: \u201c... here the  soil itself is bad, corrupt, and corrupting.\u201d",

But the game firmly cemented the football bug in his boy brain, and became the impetus to leave Purnea in Bihar for Calcutta. We know this from Umapati\u2019s own jottings, some of which have been included in the newly launched book Umapati Kumar: Maidaner Kumar Babu, an effort by Umapati\u2019s grandson Ashish Hazra.\u2028\u2028 The book begins with an account of Umapati\u2019s growing up years in Kishanganj in Bihar\u2019s Purnea district. How he couldn\u2019t control a   (pomello) while playing football with it one afternoon. It went through the fancy windowpane of his father\u2019s drawing room. Soon enough, he heard his father Rajanikanta Kumar\u2019s thunderous warning: \u201cYou are concentrating too much on playing, what about your studies? Mr Macokay is the one spoiling you\u201d.\u2028 Mr Macokay was probably the first person to spot Umapati\u2019s ease with the ball. He was the manager of the Khagra Nawab\u2019s Estate which was part of Kishanganj police station. When Umapati and his friends at Kishanganj High School practised football with either a pomello or a roll of paper wound with rags, the Britisher would join in, playing with the boys in his football boots. It is pertinent to note that football played in Bengal in the early 20th century would always be described as a game between natives who would play barefooted and the White man who played with boots on. That was how it was in that legendary 1911 IFA Shield too. The foresighted Mr Macokay had advised Umapati\u2019s elder brother to send him to England for further training, but that was not to be. Instead, the football-crazy lad continued to grow up in the land of the Mahananda, playing at the school camping ground and the ground near his house, becoming the school team captain when he was in Class II, a position he kept till his last day in school playing friendly matches with teams from Raiganj, Dinajpur and others. It is here that he met Samad, his contemporary at Calcutta Maidan who beat his school team by scoring 10 goals. \u201cSamad from Purnea Zilla School was a football magician. I noticed a funny thing about him, he would play with his legs bandaged from his knees to his ankles,\u201d writes Umapati. \u2028\u2028 It was while he was a college student that Umapati got his Mohun Bagan break. The superintendent of Ogilvie Hostel, where he put up, was Prafulla Sanyal, a Mohun Bagan player. Thus began an association of a lifetime. Kumar writes about the Maidan teams of his youth. Those days, the most-watched matches were between Calcutta Football Club, a club of British civilians, and Mohun Bagan Athletic Club. These would be played on the grounds of the Calcutta Football Club. \u201cToday people go crazy for East Bengal-Mohun Bagan matches, but when I was playing football in Maidan in my youth, East Bengal was nowhere. It  used to play in the Second Division. Once it rose to First Division but again went down. When East Bengal became a First Division club, I was nearing retirement,\u201d writes Umapati.\u2028\u2028 He describes the Calcutta-Mohun Bagan matches with great fervour. \u201cFor their Benett Colvins we had Pal Pramanik. If they had Percy Night, we had Paltu Dasgupta.\u201d There are apparently no records, no photographs of these matches. He also talks of the military teams from Fort William.\u2028\u2028Umapati wrote of the unfair advantage the British players had over their Indian counterparts in terms of training and training gear, and of the unspoken camaraderie with white referees and linesmen. But he was also unfailing in his appreciation of how spectators, even British  spectators, would enjoy the game and clap just as much for Indians when they played well. The culture and atmosphere of the Calcutta Maidan those days come through in Umapati\u2019s writings.\u2028\u2028He writes that there wasn\u2019t any scope or practice of changing teams. He himself played for a single team from 1917 to 1936. He also takes note of the changing culture of fandom.\u2028 As Shyamsundar Ghosh, former sports writer and player, who also has a chapter in the book, said: \u201cUmapati Kumar never tolerated any wrongdoing. Once in an IFA Shield match a Mohun Bagan official got in touch with an IFA official to ensure that a renowned player who had been shown a red card was allowed to play the important East Bengal-Mohun Bagan match. Umapati Kumar was then the president of Mohun Bagan. He called the club official in question and told him that Mohun Bagan never ran after trophies. He made him apologise in public.\u201d The concerned player was Subrata Bhattacharya.",

        "Article Content": "The surname, Naipaul, has almost become synonymous with Sir V.S. Naipaul, undoubtedly the most famous member of the Naipaul family. But the Naipaul family, which boasted the novelist brother-duo, Vidia and Shiva, had no dearth of scholarly or writerly talents. The love for the written word and the knack for storytelling run deep in the Naipaul bloodline. Seepersad Naipaul, V.S. Naipaul\u2019s father, was an autodidact and self-made man whose only ambition was to see his children receive accolades and laurels in the world of letters. Seepersad himself harboured literary ambitions; he wrote macabre, real-life, journalistic pieces for the   and, later, published a collection of short stories,  , capturing the shades of Indian life in Trinidad, then a colony of the British crown. Savi, aka Savitri Naipaul Akal, presents a brief family history of the Naipauls of Nepaul Street, Port of Spain, Trinidad. The book recounts the humble beginnings of life for the Naipauls, second-generation indentured labourers, and their travails, struggles to escape the barrenness of life in the island country, their hard-earned success, and eventual fallout. Except Savi, no other Naipaul lives in Trinidad now; all the other Naipaul siblings are scattered in North America or the United Kingdom. The next generation has moved further away, to newer metropolises. This memoir is about life in Trinidad as perceived from an Indo-Trinidadian sensibility. Others may argue that Trinidad is the main protagonist, presenting a suitable background to all the minor characters that bow in and bow out. After reading the book, it is difficult to resist an urge to visit the islands and know more about Indians who still call it home. The book\u2019s ability to compel us to imagine and yearn for another world, no matter how crumbling and bewildering, is one of its endearing qualities and successes. Many years after the death of her husband, Dropatie travels back to India to reconnect with her roots. But upon visiting her ancestral village, she finds herself out of place and is thoroughly disgusted by the mannerisms of her \u2018own people\u2019. On being asked by the author about her trip to India, Dropatie remarks, \u201cBeti, India is for Indians.\u201d This disenchantment haunts the Naipauls forever. \u201cBut is Trinidad really for Trinidadians?\u201d Rephrasing the rhetorical question, the author underlines the traction among various ethnic groups and the interplay of identitarian polity in the essentially multicultural setting of the islands. The statement also speaks volumes about the cultural identity of the Naipauls and Indian-origin Trindadians. The in-betweenness, fluidity, and amorphousness are not always celebratory aspects of one\u2019s identity. For the Naipauls, it also cultivated feelings of unease and non-belonging. The book is dedicated to Seepersad and Dropatie Naipaul, parents of the author, both first-generation, indentured labourers who grew up in the Caribbean islands dreaming of freedom and financial independence. They worked hard, did odd jobs, lived a frugal life and, much like typical Indian middle-class parents, bore the heavy cross of colonial pathos. Theirs was an aspirational English class. In the colonial era, the Naipaul siblings prepared for the prestigious island-scholarship and felt that winning it would be their ticket to success. With the exception of the elder-most Naipaul sibling, Kamla, the rest studied in universities based in the UK. Vidia and Shiva won the island-scholarship and secured admission to Oxford University. Both suffered nervous breakdowns while pursuing their undergraduate studies. The alienating treatment meted out to scholarship students from a colony at Oxford further aggravated their condition. The Naipaul family hoped that Shiva would benefit from Vidia\u2019s earlier experience and the fact that the latter had a base in London. But Vidia was never the son or the brother who could be counted on. Vidia betrayed the hopes of the family and Shiva was left to fend for himself alone. In 1971, the youngest of Naipaul siblings, Nalini, got admission to a university in London. Vidia, arrogant, haughty and devoid of any genuine concern for his family and friends, went back on his promise to pay for Nalini\u2019s fee and stay. Savi establishes Shiva as affable and the warmer of the two brothers, bearing an acute sense of responsibility towards his family. The Naipaul family could never recuperate from the untimely and sudden demise of Shiva who died  at the age of 44. Dropatie confessed on her deathbed that she only had one son. The memoir bursts the myriads of myths that V.S. Naipaul had built to secure a sympathetic place for himself. Savi also makes mention of the missing diaries of her mother, which were last in Kamla\u2019s custody. This is a life-narrative of a diasporic family, which has given stars to the world of literature at the cost of silencing its more humane and ordinary members.",

        "Article Content": "Late in the autumn of 629 CE, a tall, well-built man, twenty-nine years old, set off on foot from the walled capital city of Chang\u2019an. He was heading westwards, towards the wastes of the Taklamakan desert and beyond that, so he hoped, over the peaks of the Pamirs. In many ways the walker could not have chosen a worse time to set off on such an ambitious journey. The country was still in the middle of a civil war, and robbers and brigands haunted the unpoliced roads. To make matters worse, there was also a ban on citizens leaving the country, part of an attempt by the new Tang authorities to stop people joining the insurgent groups lurking in the western border country. But the walker was no rebel. Instead he was an urbane and learned monk, ordained into one of the most philosophical of the Mahayana Buddhist orders. Xuanzang wanted to travel to the source of the religious tradition to which he had given his life. Specifically, he wanted to enrol at the great Indian Buddhist monastery and university of Nalanda. There he wished to study the manuscripts held in the largest Buddhist library in the world. Nalanda, however, lay 3,000 perilous miles south-west of Chang\u2019an, and getting there would be no easy task, particularly as the Tang authorities had just turned down his application for a travel permit. Not only was it a time of violent upheaval, it was also the year of a great famine, and there was every likelihood that if the authorities or the brigands did not stop Xuanzang, starvation would. But the monk was well used to taking risks. Although he had been born into a family of elite Confucian scholars and public officials \u2014 his great-grandfather had been Governor of Shandong and his grandfather was the head of the Imperial College at Beijing, in reward for which the Emperor had endowed the family with the revenues of an entire town \u2014 it was nevertheless Xuanzang\u2019s fate to live in the violent and fractured period between two great dynasties. One, the Sui, was falling and the other, the Tang, had yet fully to establish itself. Xuanzang\u2019s father, a \u201cbrilliant and elegant man, with bright eyes, who used to dress himself in the manner of a Confucian scholar\u201d, reacted to the disintegration of his world by immersing himself in the classics. \u201cAnticipating the fall of the Sui, he  buried himself in his study with his books. Many offers of distinguished  positions were pressed on him, which he persistently refused.\u201d After his death, two of his sons became Buddhist monks, hoping to find within themselves a peace that was notably absent in the world around them. But there was no escape from the endemic violence. In 618, aged thirteen, Xuanzang and his elder brother had had to flee for their lives through the fields along the Yellow River after their monastery in Luoyang was threatened. At this time, according to Xuanzang\u2019s friend and biographer Huili, \u201cthe House of Sui lost power, and the country fell into a great turmoil\u201d. The imperial capital became a nest for brigands like Zhe the Bandit, and the region between the Yellow River and the Luo river turned into a cavern for men as brutal as jackals and wolves. Civilisation collapsed, and the Buddhist community dispersed. White skeletons were scattered at crossroads and the region was depopulated;  no smoke drifted from cooking fires. Xuanzang was deeply troubled. It was not just that society was disintegrating in front of his eyes; he was worried that the Buddhist tradition he lived and studied was deeply corrupted too. He could see that the texts he used were full of errors and discrepancies. \u201cWhen he compared editions of the holy scriptures,\u201d wrote Huili, \u201cthey showed differences either vaguely or manifestly, so that he was at a loss to decide which of the theories he should follow.\u201d Despite risking his life travelling through the burning countryside from monastery to monastery in search of Buddhist masters who could resolve these inconsistencies, he found none who could adequately answer his questions. Xuanzang felt a growing need \u201cto make further specialised studies and to resolve the contradictions\u2026 Thus he resolved to travel to the West, to India, to clear his doubts.\u201d He had heard that the university monastery of Nalanda contained the fullest and most complete collections of the texts of the tradition known as Yogacara, a spiritual path first outlined by the Gandharan monk Asanga, at the dictation of the Bodhisattva Maitreya, or so the monks maintained. Asanga maintained that our experience of the world is nothing but an illusion, a misleading creation of our own consciousness. Xuanzang believed the writings of Asanga\u2019s Yogacara school to be the peak of all Buddhist thought, and the one which had preserved the most profound and authentic secrets of his own Mahayana tradition. In particular Xuanzang wished to seek out one specific manuscript \u2014 the Yogacarabhumi, \u201cTreatise on the Stages of Yogic Practice\u201d. This was a text for which Xuanzang had been searching all his adult life. Xuanzang had also heard that at Nalanda the supreme master of Yogacara, a 106-year-old scholar called the Venerable Shilabhadra, was still teaching and, despite his age, taking on new pupils. Ignoring the many dangers, Xuanzang resolved to set off westwards, knowing that centuries earlier other Chinese monks such as Faxian had successfully made the same journey and returned alive, even leaving brief accounts of their journeys. \u201cAs the road was obstructed and long,\u201d wrote Xuanzang, \u201cthe transmission [of Buddhism to China] was still incomplete\u2026 Secretly praying for spiritual protection, I determined to go out from the land of my birth and throw myself into the realm of ten thousand deaths. When passing in the footsteps of the Buddha, I paid my respects to the numinous [presence] he left behind. If there were people who propagated the dharma, I sought out their authentic teaching. When I passed through a place, I was moved to see what I had never seen before. When I encountered a word, I rejoiced at hearing what I had never heard before. In this way, I exhausted my life\u2019s resources to copy texts that were missing at home.\u201d Xuanzang\u2019s sixteen years of travels, and the different accounts that he, his biographer Huili and his various followers and correspondents have left of his journey, bring to light an entire world that is otherwise lost in shadow and archaeological ambiguity. It is not just that we find ourselves able to draw on a sudden glut of well-verified letters to and from Xuanzang and his learned correspondents; we also have Xuanzang\u2019s own travel book, The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions, the most comprehensive account of seventh-century Central Asia and India ever produced, and written with all the care of a sceptical scholar who was unusually scrupulous in matters of fact. \u201cAlthough it was difficult to exhaustively verify all matters,\u201d he wrote in a postscript, \u201cI never resorted to speculation.\u201d Most remarkable of all, at over 80,000 characters, Huili\u2019s biography, written during his master\u2019s old age and completed after his death, is the fullest single biography to survive from pre-modern China. These different sources illuminated the intellectual and spiritual bedrock of the Indian ideas that were finding their way over the mountains and deserts and coming to change the way people in China lived and thought. It is one of the richest moments of cultural and philosophical interaction in world history. In the course of China\u2019s first really intimate encounter with an equal civilisation, not only did Buddhism profoundly transform China, bringing about a massive metamorphosis of its arts, history, society and culture at both popular and court levels; at the same time, and no less profoundly, Buddhism was changed and moulded by China. No one really knows when Buddhism first reached China. Xuanzang himself believed that it had arrived as a result of \u201ca dream of the Emperor of the Han dynasty\u201d. According to this legend, the Chinese Emperor Ming (r.58-75CE) had a vision of a golden being who had a nimbus behind his head that shone like the sun. The Emperor asked his advisers about this strange apparition and was told that in the west there was a deity named the Buddha. \u201cAs a result,\u201d wrote Xuanzang, \u201cenvoys were sent to the West, and consequently the Right Dharma was transmitted.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "After taking her stage game a notch higher last Navaratri (in Surat) with a  dhol weighing around 25kgs, Mumbai-based and Indore-born Purva Mantri is set to embark on a musical journey in September. She\u2019s taking the  dhol on her upcoming US tour next month, covering Houston, Chicago, Seattle, Atlanta, Savannah, Edison and Boston. Mantri, known for songs like Kala sha kala, Raanjhan ve, Rumjhum and \u2014 her latest \u2014 Metador (featuring Rajasthani rapper Rapperiya Baalam), recently spoke to The Telegraph. Many singers and artistes have their X factor, like some play the guitar, some sing and some play the piano. I was always into rhythm; it was my first choice because my mom is a Hindustani classical singer and when she performed, I played the tabla with her. So this part of my life is definitely one of the best experiences. Logo kaa itna pyaar mila hai\u2026 they want to see me around the world with this act. I\u2019m not a great guitarist or a piano player, but yes, I\u2019m great with rhythm. My management and my team already knew that. Last year, before Navratri, we were brainstorming for creative ideas. When I have a  dhol team from Mumbai, why not bring a taste of Mumbai to Surat. I rehearsed only once. Rehearsals are always great but when an artiste is on stage, the game changes. The first time I picked it up on stage, it was tough. On the second day, I did a little calculation... this is where I need to breathe and sing. And on the third day, it was fabulous. By the sixth day, my act was trending. There are many turning points. I think the pandemic, in a way, was the turning for me. Music has been my passion since a young age. I was in the eleventh grade and I studied commerce, which I wasn\u2019t great at. My father asked me what was wrong and what I wanted to do. I said I was drawn to the creative field. So this keeps me going. I got rejected from Indian Idol twice and then, on the third attempt, I was selected. When I went for a demo in Mumbai, they asked me to correct my pitch and it was heartbreaking. However, a few years later they appreciated my voice and the industry is open to women with powerful voices. I found my place among the audience. I love colours. Before I go up on stage, I close my eyes and visualise how I\u2019d want to look and then I brief my stylist. I love folk culture and also want to incorporate a Western element. I want to collaborate with a few artistes and rappers from there. I want to travel and meet new people. I\u2019ll drop a Punjabi pop track that we\u2019ve shot a video for; it\u2019s called Mascara. Usha Uthup and Ila Arun \u2014 both have powerful voices and stage presence that you cannot forget! It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s bhajan, Bollywood, folk or pop \u2014 singing is a duty and you need to perform your duties. If you keep moving, you\u2019ll find your way.",

        "Article Content": "There are more people inside Arun Lal than other\npeople. Cricketer. Coach. Environmentalist. Motivator.\nPhilanthropist. Boy scout. The kind of person you happen to meet by chance and\nwithin minutes you seek your son from a crowd saying, \u201cCome fast, there is this\ninteresting uncle you would really like to meet.\u201d My best story about him is something few know. Arun had a press- , someone who would\niron clothes for him. One day, the press-  came to Arun and his\nwife Reena with an unusual request: his son who had been admitted to an\nEnglish-medium school (Julien Day School) in Kolkata \u2013 by itself unusual for\nsomeone from an underprivileged background \u2013 needed some training in conversational\nEnglish. Following initial hesitation (\u201cWe thought he would\nbe here today, gone tomorrow\u201d), Arun and Reena took the boy on; he would, as\nper the arrangement, come to the couple for an hour a day for language\nfamiliarisation. Gradually, the brief extended; Reena started covering more\nsubjects. Not merely as in \u2018covering\u2019 them. \u201cIt got to a point when if we\nwanted to go on a holiday,\u201d says Arun, \u201cReena would decline saying \u2018Oh, but\nBikash has his exams coming up.\u2019\u201d Two things began to gradually unfold: Bikash\nstarted spending more time with the couple, including having a meal before\ngetting home to spend each night on the pavement off Northern Park\n(Bhowanipore). A few years later, the childless Arun and Reena started liking\nthe boy enough to formally propose an adoption with his parents\u2019 consent and\nget him to move in with them. And that is what happened: Bikash would spend the\nday either in school or at the Lals\u2019 residence off up-market Ballygunge\nCircular Road in Kolkata just like a family member, except that each night he\nwould leave for dinner with his family of origin.  From Julien Day, Bikash moved to Assembly of\nGod Church for his plus-two and thereafter to St Xavier\u2019s College for his\nB.Com. \u201cWe did something interesting for him at that point,\u201d says Arun. \u201cWe got\nhim to sit for CAT tutorials, so that he would get into the groove of competitive\nexaminations. We said, \u2018don\u2019t worry if you fail, just get the experience\u2019.\u201d Sure enough, Bikash failed. Tried again. Cleared\nthereafter. Got a call from IIM Bangalore and IIM Kolkata. Opted for\nthe latter. The general Lal family apprehension: \u2018Being a\nmathematically-oriented institution, Bikash might not be able to take the\npressure.\u2019 Bikash surprised. In his first year at one of best\nIIMs in the country, Bikash was elected Lord by his seniors; the following\nyear, he was elected President, an unlikely combination for most IIM-ers and an\nunusual combination for someone just middling academically. Bikash\u2019s next big break was when Deutsche Bank\nvisited the campus to select recruits for summer training in London. Bikash\nsent in his application for a lark; from among dozens who had sent in their\npaper, Bikash was selected. When he finished his two-year course, Deutsche Bank\ntook him in. Which explains how Bikash works for a large German investment\nbanking company in Mumbai. \u201cOne of the most moving moments in our\nrelationship,\u201d explains Arun, \u201ccame when we wanted to move from an apartment\ninto a bungalow and did not have enough money to make it happen. One day we\nreceived an envelope by courier from Mumbai, opened to find a demand draft from\nBikash for the remaining \u2013 significant \u2013 amount. On another occasion, I\nreturned from some place to find two young ladies outside my residence. They\nmotioned me to my garage. I walked across. And there was standing a silver-grey\nMercedes. Presented by Bikash for getting him where he is today.\u201d Arun once told me: \u201cA number of my friends are\nwilling to fund me to create an NGO that does only this \u2013 support deserving\nunderprivileged children \u2013 as they feel that by now, I have acquired a core\ncompetence in the subject. The reality is that this model does not respond to\nscale or financial infusion; one must feel strongly about to give a part of\none\u2019s life, time, emotion and money to provide an opportunity to someone who\ncan probably do more with life\u2019s chances than I can. But despite most of us\nhaving more than enough for this existence, we pay lip service and do hardly\nlittle to help someone transform his destiny and those of his succeeding\ngenerations. And that is where the real tragedy lies.\u201d Ah, yes. More than cricketer, coach and\nphilanthropist, the man is a warrior. Life\u2019s warrior. Pushing some envelope.\nClimbing some mountain. Like when he instinctively quit smoking. Like when he\nturned vegetarian by choice. Like when he stopped consuming honey on grounds of\nsensitivity. Like when he agreed to open the batting in a gully cricket\ntournament on Prafulla Sarkar Street after returning from the West Indies in\n1989 (\"Bloody quick\" is what he said after facing a bowler from Kidderpore).\nLike when he planted 4,000 trees on his Burul farm. Like when he took on 200\narmed miscreants seeking to evict him from his property (\"I told him that if\nthey dropped bombs, I would do the same\"). Like when he stood at silly point to\nJaved Miandad. Like when he attended a sports event for marginalised children\nand remembered that he had half a dozen unused branded running shoes and sent\nhis driver back for them so that he could give them away just like that.\nLike when he encouraged farm guests to chase butterflies. Like when he worked\nhis charm on my son to strip down to his underpants and swim the Hooghly with\nhim. Like when he put an indie dog-hugging pic as his WhatsApp profile.\nLike how he is easiest to meet at 7am at his Maidan cricket academy, when\nmost coaches would prefer to run the place by remote control. Like\nwhen he would be the first from our team to turn up with binoculars while\ncleaning the Santragachhi Jheel. Like when he raised the funds for that\nclean-up while we were still driving back from the   the first time.\nLike when he volunteered to counsel junkies. Like when he fought a 14-hour\ncancer operation just the other year. Like when he feeds dozens of birds who\nturn up at the dot of 1pm every day at his Ballygunge residence. Like how he\nwants to start a women\u2019s vocational centre in the vicinity of his farm. There is a need for science to find a way to clone\nhim.",

Another, much older story of Kolkata, is of the Kuljian Corporation\nin India (later, Development Consultants) \u2014 the first engineering consulting\nfirm in India, which was set up in the Calcutta of the 1950s. Both of these\ntales had one person in common \u2014 an elegant woman who was the pillar that held\nup and quietly supported those building these legacies. Bharati Dutt was wife\nto engineer-entrepreneur Sadhan Dutt, mother to architect and businesswoman\nShanta Ghosh and a doting grandmother to foodpreneur Shuli (Sulagna)\nGhosh.  If you have lived in Kolkata for a few generations, chances\nare the name Bharati Dutt is familiar to you, your parents or grandparents. A\nphilanthropist, a businesswoman, an excellent hostess, the first principal of\nThe Future Foundation School\u2019s Arun Nursery School \u2014 she was known for her many\nroles. She also lived a rather extraordinary life.  Born in 1928, Dutt saw many epochs of India and Bengal. She\ntravelled away from home to the US at a young age and adapted to a different\nculture. On her return to Kolkata, she became the person that ran things\nseamlessly behind the scenes, as her husband built his business. Along with\nbeing one of the city\u2019s most prominent philanthropists, she was the biggest\nchampion of what is today Sienna. A year after her passing,   spoke to her\ndaughter and granddaughter to get a glimpse into the life of Bharati\nDutt.   Born into a business family, Bharati (Jolly) Dutt nee Basu\u2019s\nlife was marked by change, and what sailed her through was her mindset and\nprinciples. The family owned Basusree, a popular cinema hall back in the day,\nalong with other cinema halls, restaurants and the venue for numerous\ngatherings and important events, including the screening of Satyajit Ray\u2019s  Bharati saw India change as it went through the Freedom\nStruggle and grew up with the everyday realities of it. \u201cFrom inside the\nshutters of the window in their Bhowanipore house, she saw the communal\nviolence of the Partition,\u201d recalled daughter Shanta. \u201cThe family hid and\nsheltered their Muslim employees during the violence. She was the only one in\nher family who gave up wearing and using anything British-made and even got\nteased for it. Yet, she refused to buy fancy clothes from shops during Durga Puja.\u201d  The story that stands out for granddaughter Shuli was when\nBharati, accompanied by one of her older cousin brothers, attended a lecture by\nSubhas Chandra Bose. At the end of the lecture, there was an appeal for funds\nand she donated her gold bangles, since that was the only thing she had on her,\ndespite her cousin\u2019s warning that  (Bharati\u2019s mother) would be\nannoyed. \u201cThat highlighted how feisty she was, and that she really knew her\nmind,\u201d said Shuli. Sticking to her beliefs, and following her mind and heart\nguided Bharati\u2019s life. When Shanta was in Class V, Bharati enrolled in college\nagain. \u201cShe had this immense urge to finish her education,\u201d remembered Shanta.\n\u201cShe enrolled in Women\u2019s Christian College and finished her undergraduate\nstudies, and then enrolled at Jadavpur University for her Master\u2019s.\u201d For Shuli,\nher grandmother\u2019s urge to learn, to improve and to always do better by\nexpanding her horizons is one of the many things she remembers her for. Bharati was studying in Asutosh College in 1949, when she\nmarried a young engineer, Sadhan Dutt, who soon moved to the US for work. As\nwith arranged marriages of that time, the courtship was brief. \u201cShe only saw\nthe back of him!\u201d said Shanta. \u201cBut she would say that he was a gentle and kind\nperson, who never said no and didn\u2019t impose anything on her. And he was a\ndoer.\u201d Bharati\u2019s own journey from Kolkata to Philadelphia and back\nto Kolkata was marked by big and small changes, cultural differences, and many\nsurprises. One surprise for the young Bengali bride was the food.\nToday, every American neighbourhood has an Indian or Asian store where you can\nbuy familiar supplies, unlike in the US of the \u201950s. \u201cThey found an Italian\nmarket in Philadelphia where they could buy lentils and spices like cumin,\ncoriander and red chilli flakes. It still exists,\u201d said Shanta. A young Bharati\nlearned to cook and joined YWCA classes to learn how to bake. She took spoken\nEnglish classes to learn to communicate in English  Later, the couple moved to Kolkata, and regularly visited\nthe US as Sadhan Dutt set up the Kuljian Corporation of India, which later\nbecame Development Consultants or DCL. Life changed again for the young wife\nand mother. As DCL grew, she not only supported and took on all\nresponsibilities of the home and family, but also emerged as a great hostess.\n\u201cMy father didn\u2019t have to worry about things like the wellbeing of family and\nguests, because she handled it all.\u201d \u201cWe used to call her the hostess with the mostest,\u201d said\nShuli. \u201cShe was at the centre of everything \u2014 she would be cooking or\noverseeing it, she would bring out the dishes, she\u2019d also be conversing with\neveryone. She was the heart of it all. And, the thing is that you could see she\nloved it. It wasn\u2019t stressful for her.\u201d While the cultural etiquette might have been a change to\nadapt to, Shanta and Shuli reckon that caring for people came naturally to the\nfamily matriarch, who always believed in community and sacrifice. Her community\nhad family, friends, and the many others she cared for and helped.  Dinner parties and guests staying over were a regular feature in the Dutt household. \u201cMy uncle and aunt, who lived in Shillong, would spend every winter with us and my mother took care of them and my grandparents, all with a smile. I think because she grew up in a large family, the idea of sharing space and hosting people came naturally to her. Keeping the harmony and happiness in the house was very important for her,\u201d said Shanta. When her grandchildren were born, she went back and forth between India and the US to help her daughters.  Even when living in the US in the early days, she would cook for other Indians who craved home cooked food. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have all the spices, so she said she would add a lot of butter to everything, since there was no ghee as well,\u201d recalled Shanta, laughing.  Making progress together also translated into building a community through philanthropic work. Whether it was helping the extended family with things like tuition fees or larger community outreach programmes like setting up a nursery school or being an active part of Sri Aurobindo Seva Kendra hospital. \u201cEducation was a big thing for her. She would help out in her own way because she wanted people to be able to complete their education, be self-sufficient and stand on their own feet. My parents also set up a trust in my father\u2019s parents name and she would regularly make donations. She did these things within her own budget,\u201d said Shanta, adding that she remembers her mother writing cheques for hospital admissions and education. It was after Bharati\u2019s passing that the family fully realised how many lives she\u2019d touched as people would meet them worried about the loss of support she provided. That is one of her legacies that the family is continuing.   Shuli remembers her grandmother telling her that a single person\u2019s achievement was never enough; good things should involve the community. \u201cShe did all of it silently and she would always tell us to do the same. In a sense, Rewant (Shuli\u2019s husband) was her last child, and she told him that \u2018the only way you can do well with Sienna or any business is if you give back to the community, otherwise it is never good\u2019,\u201d said Shuli. Everyone who knew Bharati Dutt, would always use the Bengali\nword  to describe her. \u201cYes, that\u2019s true!\u201d said Shanta. \u201cIt\nwasn\u2019t flashy, I think, but everything she did was very well put together.\u201d\nWhile her mother was always dressed perfectly with coordinated outfits, it was\nnever about acquiring material things, believes Shanta. Perhaps it was a mark\nof the time she lived in, but restraint was a vital part of Bharati\u2019s life.\n\u201cEven today, I know to turn off lights when leaving the room because she taught\nme. Don\u2019t take more than you can eat, think before buying something \u2014 things\nlike that. She was extremely organised and knew how not to be extravagant, but\nalso not stingy \u2014 she knew the balance.\u201d Bharati\u2019s indulgences were simple \u2014 a game of cards with her\nsiblings, sweets and cricket, and sometimes jewellery. \u201cOne of her indulgences was making new pieces of jewellery\nfrom her old ones. She had a special relationship with her jewellers,\u201d laughed\nShuli. \u201cShe also loved chocolate and  . I think, later, when she\nhad issues with her health, we\u2019d tell her not to have too many sweets, but\nshe\u2019d sneakily eat a chocolate or two \u2014 a Ferrero Rocher box in the corner of a\ncabinet would slowly start depleting.\u201d An adda over  \u2014 a loud one\nwith laughter and conversation \u2014 was one of Bharati\u2019s favourite things.\nEvenings were spent with each of them occupying a side of the four-poster bed,\nplaying cards and chatting.   \u201cAnd she was obsessed with cricket and football,\u201d said\nShuli. \u201cIn fact, she was very disappointed that none of us were interested in\nsports. Cricket matches were an elaborate affair and she\u2019d rally everyone in\nthe house and then treat everyone if India won. She cheered loudly and was a\nproper fan!\u201d   Bharati Dutt was the glue between her extended family, and\nin many ways, she did that through food. \u201cOn special occasions, she would have\neveryone together and it created memories for us,\u201d said Shanta. Though she took to it after marriage, Bharati was a very\ngood cook. Everything was planned and meticulous and whatever she made, she did\nit perfectly. When Shanta and Shuli started the little Sienna cafe in Jodhpur\nPark, with some recipes from Shuli\u2019s   they would talk about how to\npresent things \u2014 a trait Shuli believes was imbibed through her grandmother.\nMost importantly, Bharati believed in people leaving her home with a smile \u2014\nanother lesson she passed on to family. \u201c\u2018People should leave satisfied\u2019 was\nher mantra and when you have a restaurant, that idea is so important. If you\nspeak to anyone at Sienna also, we are happiest and most satisfied when a guest\nleaves super happy,\u201d said Shuli.  Bharati was one of the biggest champions of Sienna, pushing\nShuli and Shanta to go ahead with the business and make mindful decisions. She\nwould call at the end of every day during those early days to ask about\naccounts and sales. Shuli believes her grandmother had \u201ca great business mind\u201d\nand one of her most important lessons was being able to mix the old with the\nnew. \u201cShe never stopped learning. I think she was a bit more conservative with\nMa when she was growing up. But, she was also very open minded, and moved with\nthe times.\u201d For Shanta, her mother\u2019s biggest teaching was that \u201cyou\ndon\u2019t have to do something big to make a difference\u201d. \u201cWhile my father was\nbuilding his business, my mother continued doing small things in her own way,\nwhich is why the people of Seva Kendra and Arun Nursery still remember her\nfondly. She said that if all of us did our small part it would ultimately build\nan ocean. You do what you can but do it consistently, and keep your dignity and\nprinciples.\u201d If she didn\u2019t grow up and live within a traditional familial setup, Bharati Dutt might have donned many more hats in her life. Her daughter and granddaughters feel the same way, however, looking back at the story of Bharati Dutt, Shuli and Shanta Ghosh see the story of a beautifully lived life, nothing less than extraordinary.",

        "Article Content": "Not content with smashing records on the football pitch, Cristiano Ronaldo, the most followed celebrity on Instagram, has become the fastest to 1 million subscribers on YouTube. At the time of writing, he already has 46 million subscribers, having posted 20 videos. Called \u201cUR Cristiano\u201d, Ronaldo\u2019s YouTube channel is not a spontaneous rebellion against boredom. Instead, it\u2019s a carefully calibrated next step in Ronaldo\u2019s journey to remain the most recognisable athlete on the planet, gradually segueing from the most lethal goal-scorer in football to the internet\u2019s most compelling content creator.  As Ronaldo prepares to make more history on YouTube, My Kolkata lists seven reasons why you should check out the Portuguese\u2019s channel  If you haven\u2019t\n\u2018siuubscribed\u2019 already, then you may just miss out on all the future celebrations\nthat Ronaldo is likely to hit on his channel. And who knows, he may even\ndevelop a   song to go with it. We\u2019ve seen Ronaldo\u2019s famous\ncelebration emulated across sports over the past decade \u2014 from Chris Gayle to\nMohammed Siraj to, most recently, Carlos Alcaraz. But nothing, of course, beats\nthe original, no matter how many times it\u2019s belted out by the Portuguese\nsuperstar. Gone are the days when\nRonaldo would dominate page-three headlines for his tete-a-tete with models and\nactresses. These days, Ronaldo is quite the family man, in the company of his\npartner Georgina Rodriguez (a prominent content creator in her own right) and\nhis five children. Naturally, a lot of content will focus on the romance\nbetween Georgina and Ronaldo, alongside clips featuring Cristiano Jr.\n(Ronaldo\u2019s eldest son) learning from his dad on how to be a world-beater.  As the most marketable athlete in the world, Ronaldo starting a YouTube channel is bound to bring in even more sponsorships and endorsements for the Portuguese. And then there are his own businesses \u2014 from hotels to fragrances to underwear \u2014 that Ronaldo won\u2019t tire of promoting. Even if you aren\u2019t interested in spending your bank balance on all things CR7, it will be fascinating to see how Ronaldo does a product plug-in in between coursing on the treadmill, driving any of his umpteen luxury cars or slotting in penalties during practice. Did Ronaldo and Lionel Messi ever have a heart-to-heart chat on the field? What did Ronaldo and Jose Mourinho fall out over at Real Madrid? How bad did things actually get at Manchester United for Ronaldo the second time around? With revelations set to be even more explosive than Ronaldo\u2019s stepovers, expect a lot of tea (or whatever protein shake Ronaldo drinks) to be spilled on YouTube. Ronaldo is a fitness freak. Even at 39, he is the most sculpted player in the game, with a physical conditioning to rival footballers half his age. While Ronaldo has detailed his fitness regime before, a dedicated YouTube channel means he can do deep dives about his Greek god-esque body like never before. Want to watch Ronaldo spend 10 minutes in an ice bath or do 50 push-ups while flashing his megawatt smile or stretching his impeccably maintained legs to outrun a Tesla? All this could be just a click away. There is no shortage of fan accounts compiling Ronaldo\u2019s most memorable contributions on the football field. But nothing tops a compilation from the man himself! If you thought Peter Drury calling Ronaldo\u2019s endless goals for Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus and Portugal was iconic, wait till you hear CR7\u2019s own take on how he came up clutch time and again. What excites us most is the prospect of Ronaldo explaining his unforgettable bicycle kick for Real against Juventus in 2018! Will Ronaldo be \u201cvery\ndemure, very mindful\u201d, as so many are claiming to be in their digital lives\nthese days? Will Ronaldo show off his dance moves to the latest catchy song on\nInstagram? Will Ronaldo bring back the mannequin challenge by posing in his\ntrademark free-kick posture? The possibilities are endless when the most viral\nfootballer meets the internet\u2019s most viral trends on YouTube.",

        "Article Content": "The multifaceted and effervescent Pooja Bedi was in town on August 1 to be part of an on-stage conversation for Cafe Pehchaan 4.0, the annual event of Career After Family Enterprise (CAFE), in association with The Telegraph and the Council for Fair Business Practices (CFBP) and powered by Indcap. Career After Family Enterprise (CAFE) is an organisation built for and by women entrepreneurs, and Bedi, who has a career spanning various fields and is the founder of holistic wellness initiative Happy Soul, was a key speaker at the event. The Telegraph caught up with the actor-columnist-talk show host for a quick chat after her session at ITC Royal Bengal. I think human beings in general need inspiration and motivation, and in whatever form it can come to them. So I\u2019m happy to do my part, let\u2019s just put it that way. Women, of course, get inspired by other women a lot, so that\u2019s a motivating factor \u2014 \u201cIf she can do it, I can do it\u201d, that sort of thing enters their mind. And at the end of the day, I think any one seed that is sown in someone\u2019s brain germinates and takes root, and that spreads, like a ripple effect, forward into society. You compliment someone, for example, and that person feels really good about it, so their energy becomes really positive. They go outside and transfer that positive energy to somebody else and that whole process continues\u2026 so this ripple effect that you create by simply sowing a seed is very powerful, and that should never be underestimated. What I aim to do continuously through my workshops, through talks like this, or any events that I attend, or even personal discussions with friends or people I meet, is always try to, in some way, leave them with something that is impactful and positive and can lead to more change. What was nice about today is that it was a whole community of women, who are a community to each other. I think that\u2019s very special. I think it\u2019s very special that everyone is there to help each other be better. And that\u2019s wonderful because a woman can be another woman\u2019s best friend or her worst enemy. So it\u2019s very nice to see women enabling women and empowering them. Oh, yes! Enjoy the journey! Don\u2019t take it so seriously, like you   to do this and that \u2014 you don\u2019t   to do anything. Do it because you   to do it. Today\u2019s day of technology is so enabling in so many ways, and so disabling in so many ways. You have to use tech and make sure tech works for you and not vice versa. Your life can be swept up into wastefulness because of it or you can get the highest productivity because of it. The reason I\u2019m saying this is because your generation, you didn\u2019t know what life was like before the cell phone, or before social media. Therefore, you need to be more aware of your human journey, or chances are you are or will be quite distracted by the mire and the   of social media. Of course, social media is very useful and hugely empowering in many ways. People are making their living off it, learning things from it, people are using it for all kinds of benefits, but as I said, let it be an enabler and not a disabler in your life. Recognise when it\u2019s an enabler and recognise when it\u2019s not.  That\u2019s very kind of you to say. I believe that we are here to do what we are here to do, and it is up to us to do it to the best of our ability. That\u2019s always been my mantra, so to speak. It\u2019s a wonderful feeling to enable. It\u2019s a wonderful feeling to make people smile, whether it\u2019s as an entertainer or a columnist or as the founder of Happy Soul \u2014 to know that I\u2019m bringing joy into people\u2019s lives, no matter which avatar I choose to morph into. That I leave the world a happier place, and for any way I have taken anyone\u2019s life journey forward, I thank the universe for having given me the opportunity to do so. Because I feel good being that person.  Gratitude is the most important thing, because unless we count our blessings, we don\u2019t acknowledge what we have been given and what we can do, and the joy of what actually being on this planet is all about. The moment you have expressed gratitude you are aware of all the good things that surround you. And once you are aware of the good things that surround you, you can only amplify those.  I always say focus on your dreams, don\u2019t focus on your fears. Because where thoughts go is where energy flows from. Everything that surrounds us is energy. So whether it\u2019s money, opportunities, people, everything is energy. What you send out is what you get back. So if you think positive, you receive positive. And do it repeatedly. Don\u2019t do it for a couple of days and say, \u201cOh, nothing happened\u201d. It must be a repeated continuous process.  First, what comes from you is like a trickle. Then it becomes a small little stream, then a river and then an ocean. So start expressing gratitude, even if it\u2019s a trickle. Even if it\u2019s a drop. Start expressing it and let it become amplified. The more you amplify the good, the more good comes your way. So it\u2019s a really important message to focus on your dreams, and not focus on your fears, because what you focus on is what will come into your life. ",

        "Article Content": "If there was one political leader whom his people knew without being able to unravel, one they admired but without becoming anything like \u201cclose\u201d to him, one who was cherished as one might cherish a work of surpassing art, it was Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. He was minister for information and culture in Jyotibabu\u2019s cabinet when I first met him. He had been described to me sometime prior to that by a woman journalist I greatly respect for her discernment as \u201ca singularly handsome man\u201d and, as he received President K.R. Narayanan (in whose office I was then working), I could see  she was right. Looks have to do with an inner self no less than how \u201cone looks\u201d. As Buddhababu accompanied President Narayanan on a visit to Jorasanko, his mind sparkled, almost with the excitement of a university student. I could see he knew his Tagore. \u201cI have often wondered,\u201d the President said, \u201chas Tagore used the phrase \u2018In this haven of freedom let my country awake\u2019\u2026 or \u2018heaven of freedom\u2019?\u201d A gentle smile flashing across his face, Buddhababu took no more than a second to say, \u201cHeaven, not haven\u201d, and then proceeded to recite the immortal verse in its original. Some six years later, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela came visiting India and, of course, as any communist leader visiting India would, he came to West Bengal. By then I was working in Kolkata, entirely courtesy Buddhababu for it was he, as chief minister, who had asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to send me to its Raj Bhavan. At a giant rally in the city, Chavez recited the same iconic poem in Spanish and his interpreter, a sincere Bengali, struggled to render the poem from the Spanish into Bangla.  The mass of humanity present knew the poem well and became impatient with the interpreter. It did not want to hear an \u201canyhow\u201d rendering of the work in Bangla, it wanted the genuine thing. Buddhababu, seated quietly to a side, then rose and telling Chavez something in his ear, proceeded to the mike and, replacing the interpreter, recited \u201cChitta jetha bhoyshunyo\u201d from memory. The concourse erupted in joy. And Chavez was thrilled \u2013 his Spanish rendering was being restored to Bangla. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was an artist in politics, a curator of public discourse and debate. Had he not been impacted along with his generation by Marx, and had he not joined politics, he would still have been a man of few words and very restricted hand gestures but would have commanded the field he occupied \u2013 I believe which would have been academe. He would have been an ardent student, a wonderful teacher, with students who would have hung on his every word \u2013 few and far between as those would have been \u2014 looking for deeper meanings. And with wisps of tobacco smoke surrounding his elegant head of first black, then grey and then white crown, he would have been the toast of any campus. There is one other field he would have been a master of: directing high art cinema. He once told me, \u201cDon\u2019t go to see any Bengali film without asking me. I will tell you which to go to, which to avoid. Some of them are plain rubbish.\u201d As a film director, he would have towered. His films would have had character, psychology, humanity. Above all, they would have had engaging dialogue \u2014 in short sentences. And he would have stuck to black and white. Colour, he would have said, is bogus. He loved to use that word \u2013 \u201cbogus\u201d \u2013 for persons and things. But it is India\u2019s and Bengal\u2019s great good fortune that he chose to be in politics where his transparent sincerity, his patent integrity and his total commitment to his ideology made him more than an asset \u2013 a treasure. Throughout my five-year tenure in the state, I had in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee a chief minister I could respect, trust, and work with in mutuality. The sharp conflict between us over Nandigram was to threaten the cordiality with which we started out; it could not and did not in the slightest reduce my respect for him and my admiration. But even in the white heat of Nandigram, I understood that such negativity as had crept into our equation was driven by the politics of compulsions and obligations. I cannot forget two episodes. I once told him that a certain party functionary whose reputation was hurting the government should be sacked by him. \u201cMy party is the Communist Party. It is not a Nazi party. We do not work like that. We have procedures.\u201d I could think of some stern procedures adopted by the Communist Party (Marxist) but I was sobered by his reply. It is another story that the person concerned was to betray him and his party later. And once when I saw that he was clearly unhappy with my statements on Nandigram, I said to him, \u201cBuddhababu, you can ask for another governor, your party is in alliance with the Congress. That is how you were encouraged to ask for me to be posted here. You can in the same way ask for another governor.\u201d He was silent for a while and then said: \u201cI will not do that. I am not such a person.\u201d What could be more civil than that? As a committed Marxist, a loyal member of his party, a steady soldier of the Left, he remained an independent thinker, judging people and observing processes from the standpoint of what was bhadra, bhalo. Something in him revolted against all that was in poor taste. As governor and chief minister, we frequently exchanged letters, official, needless to say to each other. Mine would be longer than necessary. His shorter than they need have been. Once Buddhababu asked me which year I was born and, when I said \u201c1945\u201d, he merely said, \u201cI was born in 1944.\u201d More need not have been said. He was older, he knew the world that much better. I cannot conclude without saying something in partial modification of what I have said at the start of this tribute. There was one person who understood him and whom he understood and was really close to \u2013 Anil Biswas, almost exactly the same age as him. The day Anilbabu died, something in Buddhababu closed up. One needs a thought-partner in life. He now had that only in Meeradebi, his remarkable wife. Leaving his family behind would have torn Buddhababu\u2019s departing heart. But then he being he, he would not have shown it. \u201cAyyo,\u201d I said when I heard of his demise. That Tamil word says it all. Ayyo, pity us, dear Time-Keeper, for you have bored a deep hole into our country\u2019s civility.",

        "Article Content": "Kellie Gerardi \u2014 astronaut, researcher, author and mom \u2014 is among the first 100 women to be in space. In 2023, Gerardi flew as a payload specialist on the Galactic 05 research mission, during which she conducted biomedical and thermodynamic fluids experiments on behalf of the International Institute for Astronautical Sciences (IIAS). Gerardi\u2019s second spaceflight, in 2026, will witness her leading an all-female research crew aboard Virgin Galactic\u2019s new Delta class spacecraft.  Following her first foray into space, Gerardi has made it her mission to enable a new generation of scientists to use space as a laboratory, inspiring women to embrace their multitudes, and showing her daughter\u2019s generation that even the sky is no limit. With millions of followers on social media platforms, Gerardi is also the author of the acclaimed children\u2019s book series  . Currently based in Jupiter, Florida, Gerardi spoke to  on her remarkable journey, becoming an author, providing an example for her daughter, and more.  Where to begin! I grew up in Jupiter, Florida, and I always had great exposure to human spaceflight. Space shuttles were a part of the backdrop of my childhood and adolescence. Space was the standout passion of mine, but it was always a much bigger dream than just flying. My goal was to help open up access to space for a new generation of researchers. My eventual career path led me to work on space policy, regulatory reform, reusable rocket technology, defence and national security and, ultimately, microgravity research with the IIAS.  We\u2019ve spent years conducting parabolic flight research campaigns on Earth along with the National Research Council of Canada and the Canadian Space Agency. But our goal has always been to send our researchers to space, where our experiments can benefit from longer-duration microgravity exposure. My career is full of people and organisations who bet on me, and that serves as the motivation to work as hard as I can to make sure those bets pay off.  I felt incredibly well-trained and knew exactly what to expect during my spaceflight, but nothing could have truly prepared me for seeing Earth with my own eyes. I was in absolute awe. We\u2019ve all seen pictures of the Earth from space, but the difference for me was truly experiencing it as a planet among other planets. I\u2019ll never forget it. Looking down, I experienced an intense cognitive dissonance of feeling both a part of it and slightly outside of it. It was mind-bending and profound. If I\u2019m honest, I\u2019m still processing it. So, yes, I would say the \u2018Overview Effect\u2019 is definitely real, and is truly a cognitive shift in perspective.  As a payload specialist, my job is to operate experiments and conduct scientific research in space on behalf of my research institute. In 2026, I\u2019ll be leading a research crew on another dedicated science mission with Virgin Galactic, who will once again transform the cabin of their spaceship into a science lab.  On my first mission, I operated biomedical and fluid experiments and we were thrilled with the data \u2014 so this next mission is an opportunity to expand on that research. For example, I previously validated a theory about how fluids behave in a container in microgravity. Now that we\u2019ve demonstrated our ability to accurately predict this behaviour, on this next spaceflight I want to demonstrate our ability to control it as well. This data can be used to help inform new designs for technologies, ranging from spacecraft life support systems to new syringes for medication in space. I\u2019m also excited for the opportunity to introduce new biomedical research \u2014 one of my crewmates is a physician and space medicine expert, so she\u2019ll have us pretty task-loaded with healthcare experiments!   started off as a bedtime story that I\u2019d tell my daughter. Around the same time, I was also noticing a market gap for space-themed books that centred around girls as the main characters. I wrote the series as an effort to fill that gap. The sparkly future astronaut Luna Muna, with her glittery space helmet, helped create some visual representation in the minds of young girls to show that space, sparkle, glitter and science can all go together! I\u2019ve been so humbled by the reception.  has been read from the International Space Station and was also selected to be read from the White House as part of the First Lady\u2019s Reading Nook during the President\u2019s annual Easter Egg Roll, which was a tremendous honour.  I\u2019m grateful for all the female trailblazers in the world who are reshaping access and opportunity for the next generation while also embracing their multitudes. The most rewarding aspect of my own journey has definitely been experiencing it through the eyes of Delta, my six-year-old daughter. We\u2019ve had fewer than 100 female astronauts, but in Delta\u2019s mind, flying to space is just another thing girls do! She is growing up knowing that not even the sky\u2019s the limit for her dreams. It\u2019s also been a powerful reminder of how much can change in a single generation. When my mom was born, human beings hadn\u2019t yet been to space. And when she was growing up, women weren\u2019t eligible. Just one generation later, she watched her daughter reach the stars and watched her granddaughter take it for granted. It\u2019s a paradigm shift, and I\u2019m filled with excitement for Delta\u2019s generation. When you have big career dreams and you also want a family, there\u2019s no \u201cright time\u201d to have both. It\u2019s all a balancing act. Discovering I was pregnant with my daughter was the most wonderful surprise, but there were definitely adjustments. I missed microgravity flight campaigns and aerobatic flights while pregnant, and shortly after her birth, I was wearing Spanx under my flight suit just to keep my organs in the right place. I have a true partner in my husband, but over the years, there were definitely difficult times. We actually moved back to my hometown a few years ago to be closer to my parents because I needed more childcare help. Was there the occasional mom guilt? Sure. But becoming Delta\u2019s mom made my dreams burn brighter and my sense of purpose grow so much deeper. I like to share my life with mission-driven younger women who are made to second-guess if they can make a career and family work together, or moms made to feel guilty on the days when those scales don\u2019t balance \u2014 you have to tune it all out.  I think there has historically been an assumption that there\u2019s only one singular path to space. While that may have been true in the past, the emergence of the commercial spaceflight industry has helped usher in a new era of human spaceflight. My career as a researcher and payload specialist on a commercial spacecraft is just one of many examples of a myriad of new paths.",

        "Article Content": "Gautam Gambhir succeeding Rahul Dravid as the coach of the\nIndian men\u2019s cricket team can feel a bit like a calm and composed class teacher\nmaking way for a fiery and in-your-face replacement. But Gambhir and Dravid are\nmuch more than the stereotypes associated with them. Even though they have\nlargely contrasting leadership styles, they both know how to reach the pinnacle\nof success as coaches. After reaching two ICC finals in 2023, Dravid coached\nIndia to  in the West Indies. This triumph came a little\nmore than a month after   to their first IPL title since\nGambhir himself was captain of the Knights in 2014. On Teachers\u2019 Day,   compares the leadership\nlessons that we can gather from Dravid and Gambhir and how to apply them to\neveryday life.  Yes, Dravid once flung his cap in anger during an IPL match between Rajasthan and Mumbai. And yes, Gambhir can be mistaken for a monk for large parts of a game, when he is processing everything from the dugout. But the two Indian greats are known for other traits. Dravid\u2019s composure lies mostly in being reactive, in letting the game flow and having the nous to suggest tweaks whenever needed. This came in particularly handy when oiling the well-functioning machine that was the Indian team during last year\u2019s 50-over World Cup. Gambhir is much more aggressive and proactive, seeking to put his stamp on his team\u2019s identity from the get-go. Case in point being his relentless support for Sunil Narine as opener for KKR. Neither approach is foolproof, but both have proven immensely rewarding because they allow Gambhir and Dravid to back their strengths and shape their teams in their image. Under Dravid, Team India had a clear strategy \u2014 every player has a specialised role which they have to execute to the tee. With the exception of Hardik Pandya, no player in the Indian team that made two World Cup finals in the last year featured an out-and-out all-rounder. Gambhir\u2019s mantra is exactly the opposite \u2014 everyone should be able to do everything. So much so that even Rinku Singh and Riyan Parag have turned into game-changing off-spinners. While Dravid\u2019s method was safer in that it is easier to execute in the short-run, Gambhir\u2019s entails calculated risks in the hope of long-term rewards. This difference in managing talent can prove particularly instructive in corporate life, where managers often struggle to understand whether resources should focus on hyper-specialisation or become master generalists. Prim and proper, reserved and respectful, Dravid is never one to court the headlines. Gambhir, for his part, has always taken pride in wearing his heart on his sleeve. While Dravid\u2019s sedate way of handling the media can keep the temperature low around the team and the captain, Gambhir\u2019s penchant for controversial claims (he once said he preferred Marcus Rashford over Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, sending the internet into meltdown!) draws attention to himself, putting less pressure on his players. While markedly different in their public personas, what unites Dravid and Gambhir as leaders is their no-nonsense approach and their candid comments in public. Neither is one to resort to euphemism, which makes them effective communicators, something a lot of CEOs and even politicians can learn from. No matter their divergent ways of coaching, Dravid and Gambhir love to win. Gambhir, of course, said as much during a viral podcast episode with Ravichandran Ashwin. But serial winners like Dravid and Gambhir don\u2019t endlessly obsess over results. Rather, they focus on the process \u2014 something another great leader   knows a thing or two about! Whereas Dravid believes in incremental improvements using largely conventional ideas, Gambhir\u2019s process is more radical, but just as effective. Having said that, there are days when the process goes out of the window and all that is required to triumph is the champion\u2019s instinct. While they can no longer step out with the bat to inspire their teams to glory, Dravid and Gambhir can teach us how the winning instinct is infectious. Even when things go haywire, the energy they transmit in the dressing room can act as the X-factor in dragging their teams over the line. ",

        "Article Content": "History can be unkind. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who died on August 8, was a victim of this bizarre unkindness. When he was alive, Bhattacharjee was often remembered, even by his comrades, as the man who sounded the death knell of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and of the communist movement in West Bengal. There is an element of truth in this assessment but it does not capture in entirety what Bhattacharjee attempted to do and failed to do. Bhattacharjee was West Bengal\u2019s second communist chief minister. But this phase of his life cannot be appreciated without a knowledge of his formative years. The idealism associated with communism informed Bhattacharjee\u2019s consciousness from his adolescence. The communist poet Sukanta Bhattacharya, whose poems are part of any educated Bengali\u2019s memory, was his uncle. It was perhaps foretold that young Buddhadeb would join the communist movement, which he did as a student of Presidency College in the early 1960s. He started as an activist of the Student Federation of India but very soon became a whole-timer of the CPM. From then, Bhattacharjee\u2019s identity and loyalty were inextricably tied to the party. This point is important as the CPM was and is a Stalinist party. This orientation was pivotal in the fashioning of Bhattacharjee as a communist. The CPM in West Bengal, when Bhattacharjee was coming of age in the party, was controlled in terms of the party organisation by Pramode Dasgupta, who was Bhattacharjee\u2019s principal mentor in the party. In fact, Bhattacharjee, Biman Bose and Anil Biswas formed a trio with strong bonds with Dasgupta. The latter believed that the party should dominate every sphere of life in West Bengal \u2014 from politics to education and culture. Dasgupta, in the way he operated, was a textbook machine politician with pronounced anti-intellectual attitudes. Every sphere, according to Dasgupta, would be run by CPM cadre or by party fellow travellers.  And so it was over the three decades that CPM monopolised the reins of power in West Bengal. Bhattacharjee imbibed these ideas and practices. Any kind of dissent was of course not permitted in a Stalinist party. There is no evidence to suggest that at this stage of his life, Bhattacharjee was uncomfortable with the way Dasgupta ran the party and the ideas he implanted in the minds of cadres. Bhattacharjee\u2019s loyalty and commitment to the party earned for him important portfolios in successive Left Front governments led by Jyoti Basu. In the early 1990s, he resigned as minister in a fit of pique. The real reasons for his exit are not known and possibly will never be known. What is more telling is the fact that he was recalled to the ministry. This was the first and unmistakable signal that Bhattacharjee was being considered as a successor to Basu. Bhattacharjee told Ashis Chakrabarti, a very senior journalist and political commentator, that Basu\u2019s chair was not for him. This was, at best, false modesty, at worst, a piece of dissembling. It is inconceivable that Bhattacharjee was unaware of a succession plan. He was, given his growing stature within the West Bengal party, probably one of the makers of such a plan. With the coming of the 21st century a new and arguably the most important phase of Bhattacharjee\u2019s career began. He succeeded Basu as chief minister seamlessly. It was perhaps then that reality dawned on Bhattacharjee and the scales of ideology fell from his eyes. The reality was stark: steeply plummeting employment opportunities in industry, which meant that the aspirations of the youth whose parents had benefited from the prosperity engendered in the rural world by the Left Front\u2019s agrarian policies \u2014 irrigation, high-yielding seeds and fertilisers, multiple crops and so on \u2014 and land reforms (giving land rights to small tenant farmers, sharecroppers and landless labourers) were being frustrated. Added to this was the perilous state of education and public health.  With the vision for a new West Bengal, Bhattacharjee decided to take on these issues and veer away radically from the path trodden thus far by the CPM and the Left Front. He was rushing into dangerous terrain. But he was convinced that he had no other option. Bhattacharjee went about what he saw as his responsibility to West Bengal with great gusto. In the process, he had to slough off the ideological beliefs that had sustained him since his youth. From seeing private capital and private profit as evil, he began to woo capitalists to invest in West Bengal. To reach out to capitalists, he even befriended Aveek Sarkar, the then editor in chief of the ABP group \u2014 a media house which the CPM and therefore Bhattacharjee had previously treated with hostility and unqualified contempt.  Bhattacharjee began to speak a different language, which was contrary to the usual CPM speak. For this he earned respect from many capitalists and even from Manmohan Singh, all of whom saw in the new incarnation of Bhattacharjee a breath of fresh air. But the most substantive result of this turnaround was Ratan Tata\u2019s decision to set up the manufacturing unit for Nano in West Bengal. This is where the CPM\u2019s and therefore Bhattacharjee\u2019s own past caught up with him and his plans. The availability of land is one of the necessary conditions for setting up a factory. In West Bengal, land was not freely available because the Left Front government\u2019s land reforms had created rights on land. Different sections and layers of the rural population had legally vested rights on land. In a typical free market situation, a capitalist would have proceeded to get the land required to set up a factory by buying land from peasants at a negotiated market determined price. But given the situation in West Bengal, it would be a time-consuming and an almost impossible task for a capitalist investor to negotiate with every single right holder in a chosen and convenient area and buy contiguous pieces of land to set up a factory. The prevailing conditions demanded that the State step in to acquire the land for the Tatas. Bhattacharjee proceeded to do exactly this and acquired land by dispossessing peasants in Singur, near Kolkata. There were questions raised about the compensation given to the peasants. There was a further anomaly: the land had been acquired to be used for public purposes but was being given to a private company. In a Stalinist manoeuvre, Bhattacharjee brushed aside such questions. The common assumption was that the land meant for the factory had been acquired by using State power. Thus, the paradox of trying to usher in capitalism through means that Stalin had used during forced collectivisation in the Soviet Union. One could argue that given Bhattacharjee\u2019s Stalinist past, there was nothing surprising in the methods he adopted. Acquiring peasant land for the Nano factory in Singur created a groundswell of peasant discontent. Mamata Banerjee took full advantage of this situation to launch a campaign that made the Tatas take the Nano project away from West Bengal. Ratan Tata, who Bhattacharjee implicitly trusted, as a shrewd businessman had a plan B in place, as he had already begun negotiations with the Gujarat government under Narendra Modi.  Bhattacharjee\u2019s dream was about to turn into a nightmare. Peasant discontent against land seizures turned into peasant resistance in Nandigram, where agricultural land had been acquired to create an SEZ. Bhattacharjee\u2019s government and CPM cadre let loose a reign of terror in Nandigram. Violence led to loss of lives, which galvanised large sections of the people, including members of the intelligentsia, even left-leaning ones, to come out on the streets to protest against Bhattacharjee\u2019s use of violence.  The writing was on the wall: Bhattacharjee politically was on borrowed time. A populist leader was waiting in the wings. Bhattacharjee had dreamt of a new and rejuvenated West Bengal. To fulfil that dream, he had surrendered some of the beliefs that had been integral parts of his identity. There was something heroic in this attempt. The collapse of communist regimes globally had no doubt helped Bhattacharjee to reconfigure his thinking and to abandon some of his hard-held prejudices. But he could not win the battle with his past and his party. The violence embedded in the functioning of the CPM proved to be Bhattacharjee\u2019s final undoing. In a very famous passage, Marx wrote that men make their own history but they do not make it just as they please. The dead hand of the past hangs over them. Bhattacharjee had tried to make history but the dead and deadening hand of his and his party\u2019s past made him a prophet doomed. .",

        "Article Content": "Nobel laureate Esther Duflo and illustrator Cheyenne Olivier have collaborated on  , an illustrated children\u2019s version of the classic economics text professor Duflo co-authored with Dr Abhijit V. Banerjee. The duo spoke to  about the prejudices against Kolkata they once held, the city\u2019s vibrant food and rhythm, and why they love Kolkata so much.  I have always loved Calcutta. This is the first place I landed in when I reached India. However, at the time, I had many prejudices about the city. When you grow up in France, you hear a lot about Mother Teresa and leprosy and so on. We mention this anecdote in  that I had read somewhere about people having only one square metre space to sleep in in Calcutta. I used to think there was literally a square of 1m by 1m, and I wasn\u2019t sure how people could even stretch down to sleep in that space. So, that tells you where I started from. When I landed in Calcutta, my prejudices completely went away. For me, food is always a high point of any trip here. Cheyenne, of course, has even illustrated a cookbook with a lot of Bengali dishes in it [ ; they are collaborating on a second cookbook currently]. The food of Calcutta is loved even by my children, who are not very sophisticated foodies (they especially love the sweets!). Of course, this is home for me, as Abhijit\u2019s family is from here. Also, just as a city, I love Calcutta for its architecture and the vibrant rhythm of life. At the same time, like many other Calcutta lovers, I\u2019m sad to see some of the historical buildings being dismantled. I think there\u2019s a lot of potential to turn the city into a tourist hub. Tourists can come here to experience the culture, architecture, and so on. I hope this will happen in the years to come through preserving the incredible heritage and current culture that is there. Calcutta\u2019s Durga Puja has to be the world\u2019s best-kept secret. People go to Brazil for the Carnival. That\u2019s great, but it\u2019s a pity that they don't come to Calcutta for the Durga Puja in large numbers, especially when you consider the incredible creativity that is expressed during Durga Puja in all the pandals. It\u2019s just incredible. The fact that it\u2019s not more known is a mystery to me. If we could change that and promote Durga Puja properly, it would create a lot of business for the city and there would be other economic advantages as well. I stayed in Kolkata for a few weeks and fell in love with the window grids. I even ended up doing a photographic project on the grids. As an illustrator, it was a great experience for me because the patterns are very geometrical, which I love. Of course, I love the food. I also love the fact that you can walk very easily in the city \u2014much more so than in other Indian cities I've been to. Also, I was told for many, many years about how the city magically transforms during Durga Puja. I finally managed to witness it first-hand last October. It was unbelievable. I had heard many incredible things about Durga Puja, but the reality was so much more.",

        "Article Content": "Amiya Gooptu treated some of the world\u2019s most accomplished statesmen to the fanciest drinks at his home bar, despite being a teetotaller himself. He strengthened India\u2019s relationship with several countries over the course of multiple international missions, but caused a mini-crisis in Pakistan over some beef kebabs. An enigmatic man with an enigmatic story, who would have turned 91 on August 24.  The Gooptu family has had a prominent presence in Kolkata since the 18th century. In 1836, Dwarkanath Gooptu became one of the first three students from Asia to get a degree in Western medicine and went on to establish the hugely successful D. Gooptu & Co., the first dispensary of English medicines in India. His grandson, Fanindranath Gooptu, had the desire to create something Indian to back the Swadeshi Movement, and set up a pencil factory. Soon, F.N. Gooptu & Co. was the largest pen and pencil company in Asia.  Fanindranath\u2019s grandson, Amiya, was born with the weight of this legacy in 1933. He was sent to Hare School, followed by St. Xavier\u2019s College. \u201cHe became the president of the student council, and was very active in student politics. This was also the time when he found a love for theatre, winning awards for acting,\u201d says his doting daughter Ayesha. Like most Gooptu men of the time, he was expected to either study medicine and join D. Gooptu, or study factory management and work at F.N. Gooptu. However, Amiya was never one to follow suit.  In his early teens, Amiya went to the London School of Economics and Political Science to study law. Like any other Bengali boy from Kolkata, idealism was second nature to him, and Amiya filled his academic diary not with class notes, but scribbles about his meetings and protests. Not long after, he was leading the London Majlis, a society of left-leaning immigrant students from around the world. As chance would have it, the Majlis had more than politics in store for him. \u201cTheir love story started like a meet-cute from a movie! He saw my grandmother dancing at a Majlis event. For the better part of the next month, he waited for her to drop by the student council office at Trafalgar Square. When she finally did, he stood up, held out his hand and said, \u2018Hi, my name is Amiya. I share the same name as your father, so you know what a good man I am!\u2019\u201d laughs his granddaughter, Nayantara.   Amiya sang, Aloka danced. Their love blossomed, one protest at a time. \u201cThey chained themselves to the railings of Whitehall when [Nelson] Mandela was jailed,\u201d remembers Ayesha. Amiya\u2019s charms extended beyond romance. After a year in London, his university housing tenure was about to end. He was desperately looking for accommodation, having already faced more than 10 rejections owing to his Bengali name and accent. \u201cOne prospective landlady asked him over the phone if he was a fair Indian or a dark Indian. His   was Melu, which can mean dark-skinned! But he was so desperate that he said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you meet me and decide if I qualify as fair?\u2019 Needless to say, the landlady liked him so much that she agreed to take him as a tenant,\u201d chuckles Nayantara.  After spending considerable time together, Amiya approached Aloka\u2019s father to ask for her hand. His only condition \u2014 the wedding could happen only after she completed her education. \u201cDespite it being an inter-caste love marriage in the 1950s, there was no family resistance. The only opposition came because they had already met each other,\u201d jokes Amiya\u2019s nephew, Pradeep.  Aloka was in for a huge surprise when she entered the Gooptu household. She expected it to be a small family, much like hers. What she didn\u2019t expect was a vast joint family comprising five houses on Middleton Street, where hundreds of members were involved in everything. \u201cThe Gooptus are connected to nine generations of their ancestry, and everyone gathers for every important family function at our mandir in Jhamapukur. Our family home had more people than a London metro train!\u201d Pradeep jokes. However, everyone took an instant liking to Aloka. \u201cShe was the first woman in our home to work after marriage, and taught at Rani Birla Girls\u2019 College. Everyone was proud of her for being a career woman. In fact, my grandfather made it a point for her to be excused from fasting on festivals, since she would be tired after work,\u201d smiles Sohini, Amiya\u2019s other granddaughter. Sohini recently named both Amiya and Aloka in her PhD acknowledgement for inspiring her to be independent.  Sadly, Amiya\u2019s wings were clipped far too soon. His father fell seriously ill while he was still in London, prompting him to leave his law degree midway. As the eldest child, Amiya returned to Kolkata and took on the responsibility of both the family and the business. His individuality remained his most important asset. Instead of joining D. Gooptu or F.N. Gooptu, Amiya decided to do something independently. \u201cHe started not one, but three businesses. And all without taking a penny from his father,\u201d beams Ayesha. Amiya\u2019s first venture was a tea export business, which became one of the largest to the Soviet Union. The second one was an agrochemical business. The third business handled investments. He also started making advertisement films. \u201cHe would export tea to Russia, which had chemicals suitable for India\u2019s agricultural sector. He imported these chemicals and distributed them to the tea plantations here that were selling him tea,\u201d marvels Pradeep, explaining how his uncle devised a symbiotic relationship between two of his ventures. In the decades that followed, each of these ventures became successful in their own right. But Amiya was never one to be satisfied.  Amiya\u2019s grandfather had started the Bengal Initiative (BI) in the early 1900s, enlisting eminent individuals from the city to brainstorm about the state\u2019s welfare. In the 1980s, Bengal underwent another period of economic crisis, prompting Amiya to revive this institution. \u201cHe identified people who were willing to speak to the government on key issues like healthcare, justice, education and women\u2019s rights. This Bengal Initiative wasn\u2019t about making political criticisms, but a think tank providing constructive feedback to the government by drafting policies,\u201d adds Pradeep, who was one of its key members as the then-editor of  . Its founding members included other influential Kolkatans like Apeejay Surrendra Group co-founder Jit Paul, Exide managing director S.B. Ganguly, and Tata Steel managing director Russi Mody.  The Bengal Initiative wasn\u2019t just a meeting ground for people from different professions, but a confluence of communities. \u201cHe united everyone who had a stake in Kolkata\u2019s wellbeing and wanted progressive agendas under BI and created a think tank,\u201d says Pradeep. BI extended its boundaries from economics to culture, attracting thespians, musicians, artists and filmmakers, too. Prominent creative people like Goutam Ghose, Jogen Chowdhury, Paritosh Sen and Ganesh Pyne had stimulating debates at Amiya\u2019s home on stage hegemony in cinema, the curriculum of institutes like the SRFTI and Government College of Art and Craft, trade unionism in art, and much more. One of BI\u2019s most dedicated missions was to push for the re-introduction of English at the primary level in government schools. \u201cWe explained how seniors only learnt English to give exams, and eventually didn\u2019t get selected in job interviews due to a lack of confidence. We faced a lot of opposition, but eventually succeeded,\u201d Pradeep grins. BI fought a similar battle for computers. While the mere mention of computers would once lead to vandalism, they were eventually installed in government offices.  \u201cMy uncle always stood out in getting the best out of people. These were top professionals across fields and it took a lot of diplomacy to manage all the egos and interests to bring everyone together. He had no room for lobbying, and was committed to the inclusion of younger minds too,\u201d Pradeep affectionately remembers. It is this collaborative ability that got Amiya selected as the Sheriff of Kolkata in 1982.  Through BI, Amiya also undertook numerous missions to neighbouring countries to promote goodwill. His granddaughters remember pestering him after every mission to recount his experiences abroad. One particularly interesting \u2018beef\u2019 in Pakistan remains Nayantara\u2019s favourite. \u201cThis was months before Kargil, and tensions were high. The entire trip had been planned to the T, and the Indian contingent had no time for themselves. One day, some of his colleagues decided to eat street food. My grandfather was overcome with the desire to try beef kebabs as he would never get this chance at home. However, the staff at the food stall didn\u2019t comply, stating that the Indian embassy had given strict instructions to serve their contingent only vegetarian food. My grandfather lost it and caused a minor diplomatic crisis, saying, \u2018I will not leave till I get my beef kebabs.\u2019 Word got back to the embassy and it took a few hours, but he finally got his way!\u201d This \u2018appetite\u2019 for diplomacy also led to Hungary recognising Amiya as their honorary consul general of eastern India. For Amiya, his neighbourhood was just as important as the country. One of the proudest achievements of his life was the cleanup of Allen Park, as president of the Rotary Club of Calcutta Midtown. Pradeep still remembers one morning in 1996, when his uncle strode into his office. \u201cHe came up to me and said, \u2018 ,  .\u2019 He would oversee me cutting trees \u2014 that was our uncle-nephew relationship in a nutshell! Allen Park used to be a place where country liquor was distilled and drugs were sold. Today, it is where the Kolkata Christmas Festival is inaugurated.\u201d  And yet, the Gooptus don\u2019t remember Amiya solely for his legacy, but for the family man he was. Ayesha gushes over how he was often tasked with babysitting all the children, while Nayantara remembers how he separately allocated time to take them out for ice cream, and bought her most of her books. Pradeep chuckles that his business contacts would often receive Christmas cards from his uncle after one meeting. Ayesha\u2019s voice breaks ever so slightly as she says, \u201cWith all his professional roles, I have no idea how he did it. He probably had 40 hours in a day.\u201d Never one to take a break, Amiya worked till the end. In 2006, hours before a BI meeting, Pradeep received a call, stating that his uncle had passed away. The book Amiya was reading remained open on his chest. Almost two decades on, Aloka holds on to the twinkle in her eye when she remembers him. \u201cEver since his passing, she (Aloka) reads his letters every night. His side of their bed is covered with his letters and photographs,\u201d Ayesha signs off.  ",

        "Article Content": "\u201cI\u2019m so tired of people asking about my favourite eateries and dishes in Kolkata!\u201d chuckles Ranveer Brar, as he sits down for a short chat with  . The celebrity chef\u2019s grievance is justified. Much of his Instagram feels like a love letter to the city\u2019s culinary culture.  From the   to the Kabiraji, Ranveer\u2019s nugget-sized stories of Kolkata\u2019s obsession with food have recently gone viral multiple times. \u201cThis city has some very poignant stories. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah is one of the most misunderstood men in history. Everyone finishes his story in Lucknow, but very few talk about his arrival in Metiabruz and his tryst with the biryani,\u201d he says. Another thing Ranveer finds fascinating is the democratic nature of Kolkata\u2019s street food, most visible in the iconic   (fry-ups). \u201c Kolkata  (The  shows food in Kolkata isn\u2019t someone\u2019s personal property). A student and a businessman from a BMW can stand in a queue for the same   \u2014 it\u2019s a great equaliser,\u201d he explains.  Ranveer hasn\u2019t limited himself to just seasoning delectable dishes. In recent years, he\u2019s also been peppering intriguing characters on screen. Much like his food, he enjoys profound simplicity in cinema too. World cinema has been his greatest inspiration. \u201cYou can\u2019t   talk about Satyajit Ray and his  . I also love Majid Majidi\u2019s work. In terms of acting, Robert De Niro is my favourite. It\u2019s about cinema that moves me, cinema where I can feel the texture.\u201d Despite his appeal in front of the camera, Ranveer says he resisted a lot of acting offers for years. \u201cI was not very comfortable with acting and hadn\u2019t even participated in a drama in school. Ranveer, the chef, had become dominant before the camera, and when you\u2019re in your mid-40s, you\u2019re not very receptive to change. The roles I got offered were all negative characters, and I feared that they would leave a lasting impact on me,\u201d he says.   Things changed in 2022 with Hansal Mehta\u2019s  , an episode from the anthology series,  . \u201cHansal sir asked me to just read the script once. My character was this chef, who enjoyed cooking  . While reading, I connected with both the character and myself, so we met midway. After the shoot, the character didn\u2019t stay with me, but it left me with a lot of commonality,\u201d he smiles. However, Ranveer truly gained confidence in his acting chops when  , and found that the character was much more than him. Hansal Mehta shared this confidence, and soon approached Ranveer for a new role. \u201cHe told me it was time to do a negative role \u2014 a grey character. It made me uncomfortable because the character was nothing like me. But I knew that if I crossed this hurdle, it would be a personal achievement\u201d That\u2019s how Ranveer joined the cast of  . The crime thriller has received global acclaim at film festivals and is set for a theatrical release on September 13.  While the thought of working with veterans like Kareena Kapoor did make him nervous, his past experience in front of the camera helped. \u201cHaving done so much TV, and now, YouTube, I\u2019ve grown very comfortable around the camera. My mantra is \u2018pose, pause, and then impersonate\u2019. That\u2019s the only way to disconnect from the environment,\u201d he shares.  The experience has been so enriching that Ranveer now only wants to portray negative characters! \u201cPlaying a character that you would normally never relate to leaves you with a lot of empathy. Doing things that you wouldn\u2019t do in real life helps you better understand your own grey side. It\u2019s like therapy,\u201d he says.  Interestingly, Ranveer\u2019s acting has made him a better chef. \u201cActing needs stillness, even in the most violent scenes. Cooking needs stillness too, but in the rush of a restaurant, we often forget that. Acting helped me reconnect with that stillness in the kitchen,\u201d he beams.  Perhaps it is a reflection of the times we live in, or of Ranveer\u2019s growing following, but he confesses that sometimes, he feels like stepping away from the public gaze and disappearing into peaceful oblivion, just cooking. \u201cBut wherever I go, my team sends a camera behind me and says, \u2018Content  !\u2019 ",

        "Article Content": "They look at traditional folk form as a way of feeding their own theatre. So they often incorporate the forms, they incorporate the images, they incorporate the styles but they don\u2019t necessarily incorporate the people or the language.\u201d That was Anjum Katyal, writer-translator-editor, essentially talking about Habib Tanvir\u2019s contribution, only foregrounding it as the obverse to \u201cthem\u201d, who in this case is the typical urban theatre director. Katyal is one of two editors of the recently published book,  , which is a multi-layered exploration of Tanvir and his work by scholars, critics, theatre practitioners and peers. She has edited this jointly with theatre scholar Javed Malick, Tanvir\u2019s nephew. Malick died on July 24 this year. Tanvir chose the Naacha, which is a folk theatre form. Katyal proceeds to tell the story of how he came to pick it. How it all stemmed from his small-town roots \u2014 Tanvir grew up in Raipur \u2014 from living in a large family very involved with the local culture, be it the  or all-night folk performances. Katyal continues, \u201cVery rarely do we see actual rural trained actors speaking their own languages and performing on urban stages, international stages... Tanvir saw that Naacha actors had tremendous talent. For spontaneous improvisation, for comic timing, they could sing, they could dance, and that they were capable of understanding very complicated and so-called modern textual matter as well.\u201d Sometime, when he was still in Europe, all of this came together in an epiphanous moment and the soul of Naya Theatre was conceived. The first play Tanvir staged was the classical Sanskrit play  which he turned into the Chattisgarhi  . Naya Theatre is the name for the professional touring company he founded in 1959. One of Tanvir\u2019s most controversial plays is  , also known as  , revolving around the clash between an upper-caste man and a Dalit woman. In one of the scenes that the protesters took exception to, a Brahmin pandit was depicted lighting an incense stick with a burning bidi. Elsewhere, a sweeper was shown carrying away an idol in her basket. \u201cIt was all about making fun of religious ritual and it was also about showing how the subaltern Dalit very cleverly outwits the system, the religious system that is designed to keep her in her place,\u201d says Katyal. In 2003, just before the BJP came to power in Madhya Pradesh, Naya Theatre had been touring the state with the play. The performances were disrupted by BJP workers at multiple places, slammed for being anti-Hindu, all of it arising from the mistaken belief that it was written by a Muslim. The play was actually a Chhattisgarhi folk play, written sometime in the 1930s. The then incumbent Congress chief minister Digvijaya Singh, who had at first invited them to stage the play, later withdrew support. A report in The Telegraph from October 2003 quotes Tanvir as saying: \u201cAfter performing in six towns of Madhya Pradesh we arrived in Gwalior for our performance. The moment there was a reference to the Babri Masjid as a turning point to communalism, there was trouble.\u201d In this context it must be remembered that a Naacha play does not have a fixed script; actors improvise and incorporate issues from current news. There are a host of Tanvir\u2019s plays that would resonate with audiences today. But Katyal chooses to talk about perhaps the lesser-known Bahadur Kalarin, which was apparently Tanvir\u2019s personal favourite. Kalar is a caste of rural brewers and the  play is a folk legend from Sorar, Chattisgarh. While Bahadur Kalarin is a very much local play with echos of Oedipus,   is Tanvir\u2019s adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s  , and  is based on the Bhopal Gas Tragedy. In Tanvir\u2019s centenary year, there have been stagings aplenty of his plays and plays about him, theatre masterclasses, panel discussions. Some of these will be hosted in Calcutta over the next few days. Which brings us to the question of Tanvir\u2019s relevance today. Katyal seems to think of him as the champion of subversion, be it in  or or  . She says, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t just making art for art\u2019s sake, getting kudos being feted by the elite and going to fancy parties and having his name published in the papers... He felt that we have the wrong idea, we do not understand the sophistication in the villages, we think they are dumb or they are stupid or they are less evolved than us but that\u2019s not true. And he wanted to prove that.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "Singapore is one of the\nmost popular travel destinations in the world., offering a diverse range of\nexperiences \u2014 from its rich culture and cuisine to its blend of traditional and\nmodern tourist attractions. To learn more about Singapore and the latest\ndevelopments there,  had a candid conversation with Renjie\nWong, the Area Director \u2013 India (Mumbai), Middle East and South Asia, Singapore\nTourism Board in Kolkata.  Edited excerpts\nfrom the interview follow. Renjie Wong: Singapore, as a\ndestination, changes rapidly and frequently, much like India. Every time you\nreturn to Singapore, there\u2019s a completely different set of things to see, do,\nand enjoy. I visit Singapore once every two-three months, and each time, there\nare a whole bunch of new places I want to explore \u2014 whether it\u2019s retail,\ndesigner shops or a new part of town that has become popular with trendy\nrestaurants. Post-pandemic, the pace\nof change has only accelerated. There are new restaurants and Singaporeans\ncreating businesses that focus on lifestyle and leisure.  Singapore is also\ninteresting because it is not only a global city, but you also have\nSingaporeans embracing their own heritage. In the food, art, and culture\nscenes, for instance, Singapore is constantly evolving as a destination, with\nlocals drawing not only on global influences but also on our own\nidentity. I would say that Indian\ntravellers are leading the way as global consumers because they are always on\nthe lookout for new, exciting, and different experiences when they travel. I\ncan think of two key things that are really exciting for the Indian travellers.\nFirst, is the range of new attractions available \u2014 not just family-friendly\nones, which Singapore is well-known for, but also attractions that appeal to\nyounger travellers. Whether they are on a solo trip, a bachelor\u2019s trip, a\nfriends\u2019 trip, or a honeymoon, there\u2019s something for everyone. What are some examples\nof these, you may ask. We\u2019ve all heard about Sentosa that\u2019s famous for\nUniversal Studios, the Sea Aquarium, and so on. But many people don\u2019t realise\nthat Sentosa is a big island. Other than the well-known attractions, there are\nreally cool beach clubs, luxury resorts, and developments with a variety of\ndifferent attractions. One example is an area\nthat faces the sea \u2014 a beautiful part of town \u2014 where there are several new\nattractions that are particularly exciting for younger travellers. This\nincludes Hyper Drive, an e-go karting experience where you can race against\nyour friends, collect points, and enjoy light projections \u2014 almost like a\nreal-life Mario Kart. It\u2019s all indoors, spread across three stories. Next to\nthat is a mini golf zone, which is always a hit with everyone. Plus, there are\nbeach clubs that overlook the sea. Even in the\nfamily-friendly space, we\u2019ve seen that existing attractions are offering new\nexperiences. For example, Bird Paradise is our new bird park, which replaced\nthe famous Jurong Bird Park that was located in the west of Singapore. The new\nbird park opened last year and is now situated near the other wildlife parks in\nSingapore. What\u2019s fascinating about\nBird Paradise is that, unlike a traditional bird park where you watch birds\nfrom behind a glass wall or in cages, here, you actually enter the enclosure\nwith the birds. There are seven larger-than-life aviaries. These are the habitats\nthat are huge areas covered with nets, but are each meant to replicate a\ndifferent part or habitat of the world. For instance, you have the Amazonian\nrainforest, the tropical jungles of southeast Asia with the respective wildlife\nand birds that you see in these places. This offers a whole new way of\ninteracting with and understanding wildlife.  I would also like to\nmention the new experiences within existing attractions, such as Gardens by the\nBay. It is one of our iconic and much loved landmarks in Singapore. They\nhave a rotating roster of new experiences. One of these is the Aurora Borealis,\ninspired by the Northern Lights. Through a combination of technology, light,\nsound and mist, it replicates the mystical nature of the Northern Lights right\nin the heart of the City Centre at Gardens by the Bay. If you have seen the\nGardens by the bay, you know it feels almost like you are in the  \nworld.  India and Singapore have\na long-standing friendship in the tourism sector. Singapore has been popular\namong Indian travellers for a long time due to our shared history, and when\ntravellers come to Singapore, they often feel a sense of home and familiarity. What consistently\ninspires us is that when travellers visit Singapore, they seek a few key things. Apart from the wonderful world-class experiences, they appreciate the fact that Singapore is\nsafe and convenient, there is the hygiene factor and it\u2019s easy to get around. Travellers today are no\nlonger just ticking off bucket list items or visiting one big attraction or\nmonument. They want to see a destination and understand\nhow people live in another country, celebrating both the differences and the\ncommonalities. I think between Singapore and India, in particular, there is a\nvery strong connection and an affinity for Singapore as a destination. One of the things we\u2019re\nthankful for is that it\u2019s fast and easy to apply for a Singapore visa. And for\nthat, we owe our gratitude to our friends at the Singapore consulates and the\nSingapore High Commission. It\u2019s important to us that the process remains easy,\nfuss-free, and quick for Indian travellers when they want to visit Singapore.\nWe are constantly working with our Consulate and High Commission to fine-tune\nand refine the process, but our commitment remains to ensure that it is\nhassle-free for Indian travellers to get a Singapore visa.  As I mentioned previously,\nSingapore, as a destination, is truly a game-changer. Indian travellers are adventurous\nand have access to a diverse range of places to visit, even within India. But\nwhat sets Singapore apart is that it offers a very high return on investment\n(ROI). Singapore is easy and convenient to visit. We are connected across 17\ndifferent getaways across India with 288 weekly flights to Singapore. Once you\nland, getting around Singapore is effortless. That\u2019s a tough question\nbecause there\u2019s so much to explore ( ). What sets Singapore apart\nis its  , where you get both traditional and local fare. Singapore\u2019s\nstreet food is recognised by UNESCO as part of our Intangible Cultural Heritage. It\u2019s precious because at a hawker centre you are eating\nalongside locals. There\u2019s a wide range of\nfood options, from traditional dishes to next-generation businesses rethinking\nwhat it means to be a hawker. They\u2019re transforming classic dishes like chicken\nrice or vegetarian vermicelli into contemporary formats. That\u2019s one end of the\nspectrum. On the other end,\nSingapore, by virtue of being a global city, has some of the finest restaurants\nin the world. Whether you are talking about the Michelin stars to Asia\u2019s 50 Best lists, the World\u2019s 50 Best lists \u2014 we have all of that. Food for us is\nculture \u2014 it\u2019s an experience. Yes. The collaboration\nwith Rahul Mishra was wonderful because it\u2019s rare to find someone as creative\nand visionary as Rahul, who truly understands what an extraordinary experience\nis. He is all about craft and meticulous attention to detail, transforming an\nordinary piece of clothing into something memorable for the most special\noccasions. That\u2019s why it was so rewarding to work with him. He came to Singapore and\ncreated an entire collection inspired by the city, taking it as a destination\nfor weddings and photoshoots, and reflecting what he considers the classic\nRahul Mishra bride. Beyond that, our focus\nin the Indian market is always on identifying like-minded partners, who share\nour vision and creative spirit. We aim to collaborate with game-changing visionaries,\nwho can tell the story of Singapore. While I don\u2019t want to spoil the surprise,\nwe have a few exciting projects coming up that are similar in nature to this\npartnership with Rahul Mishra.  Honestly, it\u2019s hard to\nanswer what\u2019s new, because Singapore has something that pops up every day. One\nof the things I do want to highlight is that, according to our data, Indian\ntravellers are increasingly exploring different aspects of Singapore. While traditional\nattractions are very popular, Indian travellers are eager to discover other\nparts of Singapore. For instance, Tiong Bahru, a charming art deco precinct on\nthe outskirts of town, features a fantastic hawker centre. Surrounding it are\ndelightful shops, Instagrammable art galleries, independent boutiques,\nbookstores and wine bars. Another precinct that\u2019s getting\nvery popular amongst Indian travellers is Joo Chiat. Historically, it was liked\nby the Peranakan community in Singapore. The Peranakan are a community with\ninfluences from various Southeast Asian cultures, including Malay and Chinese,\nwhich contributes to the precinct\u2019s distinctive charm. As an insider tip, I\nwould definitely recommend checking out Gardens by the Bay. There are two\nbeautiful restaurants inside. In the Flower Dome, there is a Michelin-star restaurant called Marguerite. They offer botanical fine dining with refreshing\nfood and a beautiful tasting menu, complete with cocktail, wine, or\nnon-alcoholic pairings. Above Marguerite, there\u2019s also a cafe called Hortus,\nwhich serves delightful high-tea sets. Another recommendation\nwould be exploring the immersive walking tours available in Singapore. These\ntours are not like the usual ones, as our tour providers have a magical ability\nfor storytelling. For example, when you visit Chinatown, you\u2019re not just seeing\nthe monuments but also learning about the people who lived there \u2014 both prominent\nfigures and everyday individuals.  Some of the more\ninteresting types of tours that we have are a night cycling tour around the\ndowntown Marina Bay area or a third-generation hawker tour, where you go to a hawker centre to meet young chefs who are innovating traditional dishes\nwhile preserving the essence of our hawker culture. Number three is from the\nperspective of our food options. Orchard Road is world famous for shopping in\nSingapore. However, many people don\u2019t know that the basements of the shopping\nmalls house some of the best street food, offering a wide variety of affordable\noptions. As you go up the floors, you\u2019ll find excellent restaurants serving\nJapanese cuisine, dim sums and Malay dishes.",

They trace their roots to\nthose who converted to Christianity in the 16th century when Portugal took over\nBombay. On May 11, 1661, Charles II, king of England, Scotland and Ireland,\nmarried Catherine\nof Braganza, daughter of John IV, king of Portugal. Mumbai (then Bombay), which\nwas then a Portuguese colony, was handed over as dowry in marriage.  As the East\nIndia Company took control of Bombay, it started recruiting local Christians,\nwho had been converted during the Portuguese regime. The Christian community of\nthe nearby Portuguese colony of Goa took advantage of the situation and shifted\nto Bombay for employment opportunities.  This led to an ethnic conflict and during\nQueen Victoria\u2019s golden jubilee (around 1887), the Christians of Bombay region renamed themselves\nas East\nIndian Christians, as they were employees of the East India\nCompany. Later, they preferred to call themselves the East Indians. Today, the\nEast Indians are a predominant fishing community settled in the northern corner\nof Mumbai.  The coastal villages are\nmarked with relatively large houses along with scattered grottoes (grotto\nrefers to a small picturesque cave, especially\nan artificial one in a park or garden) and occasional churches. As\nChristianity spread, the Portuguese started building churches and a few of them\nstands to this day. This includes the Our Lady of Bethlehem Church in Dongri.\n The church dates back to 1613 and has a simple facade and houses the\ngold-plated wooden statue of Mother Mary with Infant Jesus. The area also has\nits share of new churches and one of the latest addition is the Velankanni Church\nat Uttan, constructed\nin 2000. The altar houses a simple but elegant statue of Mother\nMary with Infant Jesus.  The\ngrottoes of East Indians generally represent follies housing statues of Christ\nalong with Mary, Joseph and a host of other Christian saints. These are often\nhoused inside the church complex and even inside private properties. There are\nalso many in public places and even on rocky outcrops along the beach.  The area had its strategic importance and the Portuguese\nmade several forts to keep the region safe from the invaders. Dongri Fort is\none the few remaining forts of the Portuguese era. It is located at the mouth\nof the Vasai Creek. It stands on an elevated region located south of the Vasai Creek.\nA few bastions and a few ruined stone huts are all that remains of the four-century\nold fort. But it\u2019s strategic portions provide a great view of the Vasai Creek,\nArabian Sea and the skyline of the ever expanding city of Mumbai.  Fishing is the mainstay of the region and no wonder,\ntrawlers and boats are integral parts of the coastal landscape. The beaches are\nbustling with fishing activities. During the morning hours, activities are at\nits peak but the various activities go on throughout the day.  Incoming trawlers bring in fresh catch of fish from the high\nseas. After unloading, a large portion of the fish are packed with ice and are\nmade ready for transportation. The other portion are kept aside and are sun-dried. Bombay Duck refers to dried lizard\nfish (lote), which are caught in the region and has a demand in West Bengal. The\ndried fish, which has a long shelf life, are transported by Mail trains across\nthe country to Kolkata. The Bengali word for \u2018mail\u2019 is \u2018dak\u2019, and hence, the\nname Bombay Duck. Over the years, the term Bombay Duck is generically referred\nfor all varieties of dried fish. Today, the beaches of north Mumbai have large\nbamboo scaffolding where huge quantities of fishes are kept to dry under the\nsun.  The fishing villages with their frenetic activities and the\nstrong smell of fresh and dried fish are not touristy but the region also\nhas its share of pristine beaches complete with luxury resorts and shacks\nselling mouth-watering sea food. The Gorai beach has few fishing activities and\nhas long stretch of sand.  It is suitable\nfor bathing but there are few rocky outcrops which may pose danger to the\nbathers. These outcrops are usually marked with red flags and the beach also\nhas a team of properly equipped life guards. Horse carriages provide joyride to\ntourists. The beach is lined with coconut trees creating a beautiful landscape\ncombining the sand and the sea. ",

        "Article Content": "Pine clad mountains,\nlow hanging clouds blanketing deep valleys, fluttering prayer flags, green\nmeadows and apple orchards that remind me of Switzerland. I am in remote\nBumthang (meaning beautiful field) in central Bhutan. Dotted with some of the\ncountry\u2019s oldest temples, monasteries and fortresses, Bumthang is the religious\nand cultural heartland of Bhutan. Known for its dairy, honey and fruit spirits,\nand brandies, Bumthang is swathed in buckwheat and potato fields, and has four\nglacier carved valleys \u2014 Ura, Chumey, Tang, and Chokhor \u2014 each with their\ndistinct culture. \u201cIt\u2019s the favourite posting for civil servants in Bhutan as\nit has the maximum number of religious holidays,\u201d says my local guide Sithup,\nwith a smile. I arrive at the\nluxurious Amankora, an Aman resort in Bumthang\u2019s Jakar town after a long drive.\nWith sixteen suites with king beds and wood burning hearths, this lodge takes\nits design cues from traditional Bhutanese architecture and is done up in\nminimalistic aesthetics and muted palettes. Situated right by the Wangdicholing\nPalace, the home of the first two kings of Bhutan, it opens to views of the\nmountains. I unwind with a relaxing holistic massage at their spa after the\nlong drive here, and have a delicious Bhutanese dinner with red rice, cheesy  with chillies, local noodles and hot Apple cider. History, legends and\nstories of the past whisper from every corner of the Bumthang valley. Many\nsites here are associated with Guru Rinpoche \u2014 the patron saint of Bhutan who\nis said to have arrived from Tibet atop a flying tiger and is credited for\nintroducing Buddhism to the land. It is said that he visited Bumthang to deal\nwith a troublesome deity, and legend has it that he hid many Buddhist teachings\nto be discovered by the faithful in the future. It is also the birthplace of\nthe legendary saint Pema Lingpa, to whom the Bhutanese royalty trace their\nlineage. The Jakar Dzong, like\nmany of the  \u2014 fortified monasteries that are found throughout the\ncountry \u2014 sits on a ridge, and is the first place we visit in the valley. \nIt is accessed by a steep path lined by flowering plants and coniferous trees,\nand offers a panoramic sweep of the Chamkar Valley below. It is called the\nCastle of the White Bird, because when choosing a location for the  ,\nthe founders spotted a white bird perching on the mountaintop, and were\nconvinced it was a good omen. Estimated to be built\nas a monastery in 1549 by Tibetan lama Nagi Wangchuk, it is also used partly as\nan administrative office \u2014 like many other big  in Bhutan. We walk\nthrough a maze of walled passageways, towers and tranquil courtyards with\nintricate paintings and decorations, as claret-clad monks of all ages walk\nthrough the corridors, some carrying provisions and supplies. I chat with young\nmonks who look curiously at me, and giggle as I take photographs of them going\nto their class. We drive through vast\nfields of sunflowers and buckwheat to Jambay Lhakhang (or Jampey Lhakhang),\nwhich is one of the 108 temples built by King Songtsen Gampo of Tibet in 659AD\nthroughout the Himalayas. Often credited to be the first king to bring Buddhism\nto the Tibetan people, legend has it that the king built all these temples to\nsubdue a female ogre and pin her to the ground. Senior citizens of all ages\nbundled in woollens, walk slowly around the temple, as they turn the prayer\nwheel. \u201cThey not only pray and meditate, it also is good exercise for them,\u201d\nsays Sithup.  Inside the temple,\nsurrounded by the fragrance of butter lamps, sits a statue of Jampa, the Buddha\nof the future, with his feet on an elephant. Inside the inner sanctum, is a\nchapel lined with ancient murals or  depicting 1,000 Buddhas,\nwhere visitors sit quietly meditating. This is also the venue\nof the annual Naked Dance, part of the Jambay Lhakhang Drup Festival held in\nthe early winter months between late October and mid November. \u201cAt the stroke\nof midnight, 16 naked men dance galloping in the air, accompanied by the music\nof drums and cymbals, their faces covered with masks,\u201d explains Sithup, adding\nthat \u201cobviously no photography is allowed.\u201d The story goes that demons delayed\nthe construction of a monastery by destroying it every night, thus, Terton\nDorje Lingpa \u2014 known for establishing many religious dances \u2014 started the Naked\nDance to distract the demons. The most picturesque\nof all the sites is Kurjey Lhakhang, one of the most sacred and holy sites of\nBhutan. Kurjey translates to \u2018the body imprint\u2019 \u2014 in this case, the imprint of\nGuru Rinpoche. Situated on a hilltop, the whole complex is enclosed by 108 small\nstupas, along with a huge cypress tree, believed to have grown out of\nRinpoche\u2019s walking stick. I am slightly\nbreathless climbing a steep flight of stairs in these high altitudes to reach\nthe cave where Rinpoche meditated and left his body imprint. The temple was\nbuilt around this, and over the centuries, more temples were added. The main\nstatue in this sanctuary is of Guru Rinpoche, flanked by his eight\nmanifestations and eight chortens. My favourite temple is\ntranquil Tamzhing or Tamshing Lhakhang, also known as the Tamzhing Lh\u00fcndrup\nMonastery, which houses one of the oldest statues of Rinpoche built by the\nsaint Pema Lingpa. It has ancient  and a heavy iron net supposed\nto have been made and blessed by Pema Lingpa. Locals believe that their sins\nwill wash away if they carry the iron net and circumambulate the temple three\ntimes.  Not far from the\ntemple, we have a delightful lunch at a farmhouse, where a mother-daughter duo\ncook and serve us local specialities like the national dish of  cheese\nand chillies  , buckwheat pancakes and flat noodles called  served with the local fiery  or  a clear or creamy\nlocal alcohol distilled from rice or millets. The food feast continues at\nAmankora with Chef Tshering Phuntsho serving us some unique recipes from\neastern Bhutan at dinner, including a roasted wheat flour soup and a piquant\nmountain radish curry. Not everything in\nBumthang is about religion though. There are several pretty trails and hiking\nroutes for those who like adventure. A popular route is the Bumthang Owl Trek \u2014\na three-day journey that takes you through ancient forests, high mountain passes,\nand traditional villages. Bumthang is also home to two national parks with\nAlpine meadows, which shelter rare species like the Himalayan black bear, snow\nleopards and wolves.  Bhutan has about six\ndifferent species of honeybees and Bumthang, which is one of the leading\nhoney-producing regions of Bhutan, has hundreds of beekeepers. In fact, I found\nbee houses in Amankora\u2019s compound. I visit the local beekeepers cooperative and\nunderstand the process. Local farmers bring moveable frame hives here and they\nget paid per litre of honey extracted. There are no additives and the pure\nhoney is bottled and sold. \u201cReligious belief was a hurdle initially, as it was\nbelieved that extracting honey was a sin. Now thankfully it\u2019s changing,\u201d says\nKeunzang Wangdi, of the Beekeepers Association. Along the highway to\nChamkhar town in Bumthang, at Chumey, we visit the Yathra workshop to see the\nbright fabric woven from sheep and yak wool. Women weave the fabric on\nhorizontal frame looms and use organic colours for dyeing the fabric, which is\nused to make rugs, mats, jackets and bags. \u201cThis thick fabric is ideal for\nthe  harsh  winters in the valley,\u201d explains Sithup. We also drove into\ntown to visit the state-of-the-art microbrewery of Red Panda, one of Bhutan\u2019s\nmost popular beers. Started by a Swiss cheese maker, Fritz Maurer, who came\nhere in the 1960s on the invitation of the King, Red Panda makes small batches\nof pale Weiss beer. Next door to the microbrewery is the cheese factory that he\nhelped start, which makes some great gouda and emmental cheese. On my last night in\nBumthang, I sit by the bonfire, breathing in the cold air at the lodge, as a\ngroup of women from a local temple dressed in traditional  , perform\ntraditional dances. They stage a welcome dance, a Zhungdra \u2014 an ancient folk\ndance usually performed in monasteries, where the women stand in a single row\nand dance in slow movements, and they end with a fusion number that has some\nEnglish lyrics thrown in. I am pulled in to dance along with them, and I get\ninto the flow enjoying my last night in this beautiful corner of Bhutan.",

        "Article Content": "International travel\nhas always been a pain point for Indians especially in the planning stage. More\noften than not, countries high on your wishlist get knocked off because getting\na visa is inconvenient, stressful, and difficult to secure in time. Europe,\nwhich has always been a top destination, requires a Schengen visa, which in\nturn demands an incredible amount of documentation from Indian travellers with\na high risk of rejection. The United States offers a visa valid for a glorious\n10 years but trying to get an appointment without waiting over a year is next\nto impossible.  So, if you want to\nmake the most of the upcoming festive season or plan spur-of-the-moment trips \u2014\nwhich on our passport seems like a luxury \u2014 where can you go beyond our beloved\nThailand and Nepal?  Here are a few\ncountries that have made travel easier for Indians. While they\u2019re not all\nvisa-free destinations \u2014 most require an e-visa or an easy visa on arrival \u2014\nthe process is smooth, painless, and more importantly swift.  Azerbaijan has seen a\nboom in tourism becoming a trendy and trending travel destination in the last\nfew years. Indian travellers have discovered this Eurasian gem \u2014 more so post\npandemic \u2014 and have been flocking to the capital city of Baku and then wandering\nfurther into the country to explore its beautiful landscape. Even if all you\nhave time for is a quick quick 3- or 4-day getaway, the capital city offers\nmuch excitement with experiences like visiting volcanoes and ancient rock\nformations with petroglyphs, lots of shopping, fun cafes and restaurants, all\nmaking you feel like you\u2019re visiting a European country instead of an Asian\none. Eurasian countries\nhave started gaining popularity in recent years, and one of the most underrated\ndestinations is Kazakhstan. You can immerse yourself in Kazakh culture in the\ncapital city Almaty by visiting the busy Green market, exploring Zenkov Cathedral\nand the central mosque. Visitors who like winter sports shouldn\u2019t miss\nShymbulak, known for its ski slopes. Stop by Shymkent, the ancient crossroads\nof the Silk Route to indulge in some of the best Kazakh food in the country.\nThe natural landscape in the country is stunning and it\u2019s visa-free for Indian\ntravellers. We suggest you make the most of it before it becomes the next\ntourist hotspot.  It might seem\nunthinkable,  as most travellers equate Australia with lengthy and strict\nvisa processes, but the truth is that Australia now has an e-visa for Indians,\nand a fuss free one at that. Australia is a stunning destination offering a\nwide range of activities and experiences for every kind of traveller. It\u2019s\nfoodie central for those that are looking for cuisine-based travel and\nimmensely popular thanks to TV shows like  , but also\noffers fun adventures and plenty of action if you\u2019re a water baby. Experiences\nin Australia can range from luxury to adventure. Think a helicopter ride over\nthe Great Barrier Reef, holding a Koala and visiting Kangaroos, dining at top\nhatted restaurants in major Australian cities (their equivalent to the Michelin\nStar) or exquisite wine tastings in the Yarra Valley. It\u2019s all possible with a\nsimple e-visa. African adventures are\nunlike any other. The Maasai Mara is truly one of God\u2019s best creations and with\nthe ease of a visa on arrival minus any grinding paperwork Indian travellers\ncan fly to Kenya hassle free to experience the beauty. Fly into Nairobi and\nspend a couple of days visiting an elephant sanctuary, feed the giraffes and\nvisit local traditional markets. Meat lovers can dine at the city\u2019s famous\nrestaurant, The Carnivore, before heading out to the Maasai Mara or other\nnational parks for an epic safari adventure of a lifetime. Most travellers\nassociate Kenya with just wildlife but the north is home to beautiful beach\ntowns like Watamu ideal for a couple of days of swimming, snorkelling and\nrelaxing on the beach after your safari adventures. While Indian passport\nholders have a visa on arrival, Indian travellers will need to obtain an\nelectronic travel authorization (ETA) up to 72 hours before travel.

        "Article Content": "Brahmapuri, located in Maharashtra, is the headquarters of the Brahmapuri  in Chandrapur district. Should you do an online search for Brahmapuri Territorial Forest, you could be guided to nearby places, like the more famous Tadoba. Brahmapuri Territorial Forest remains an enchanted space many search engines have yet to discover. I would prefer Brahmapuri to remain as it is now \u2014 green, verdant, mysterious and awe-inspiring. Fed up with my routine urban existence, I turned to Sunil Limaye\u2019s invitation to visit Brahmapuri. As an IFS officer and the former principal chief conservator of forests, Maharashtra, he is fondly known as the Father of Tadoba and is a dear friend who appreciates my love for the great wild outdoors. I knew Brahmapuri would be captivating.   The forest area is approximately 1,200sqkm, divided into north and south Brahmapuri with tigers inhabiting both. An official count shows the presence of 62 adult tigers, 19 sub-adults and 23 cubs. The ratio of tigers and tigresses present per square km is far less than the acknowledged permissible limit, creating a complex tangled web of parenthood and progeny leading to unique, unheard-of adjustments and survival modes among the animals. The forest area is so dense that trails permit only bikes and cyclists for regular forest patrols. There are hardly any safari tracks as seen in other territorial forests. However, the entire area is also interspersed with villages as it is within the  area with inhabitants living in the jungle for generations.  Faced with the challenges of protecting the diversity of Brahmapuri forest area and its denizens, both state and central governments are working to relocate villagers to other places with parallel livelihood facilities. It is an uphill task, as villagers are rarely satisfied with compensation packages despite man-animal conflicts over the years that have claimed the lives of local people. Thanks to the relentless efforts of forest department officials, including intensive awareness drives, this year there have been fewer reports. The Ekara forest rest house built in 1946 inside Bramhapuri needs a special mention because of the food\u2026 the Gaurani country chicken.  Forest talk\n       It was time for an excursion into Brahmapuri Territorial Forest. I set out in a regular forest vehicle with five other forest department officials to explore. Sunil Limaye accompanied me. We stopped for a quick round of tea and \u201cforest talk\u201d followed in the vibrant green surroundings. Mangesh Tante, a young official of Maharastra\u2019s forest department gave me the lowdown on the tiger population of the area, and the idiosyncrasies of the predators. I asked him how they tackle man-animal conflicts in the area. The entire team pitched in with responses, sharing anecdotes about how tigers are learning to adapt in amazing ways to diverse environments. Tante informed that due to the low density of the prey base, tigers have been known to go, at times, without hunting and eating for more than a week. We proceeded on our safari. Summers in the Indian subcontinent can be harsh and unforgiving. But inside the forest, despite the humidity, it is a different world. Brahmapuri, even at the height of summer, displays the unmistakable features of a grand tropical deciduous forest. Its distinct ecosystem is an interdependent play of water, sunlight and air circulation.  As part of the six-member team, I travelled deep into the forest in search of the tiger. It was dark, humid, and full of forest smells created by hundreds of plants native to Brahmapuri and the region. I was aware of the dense network of trees that made the forest dark and secretive and noticed trails leading nowhere, created not by humans but by animals. The roar\n       While moving across the forest, we came upon a tigress with a litter of four. Her adorable babies were playing about her as the grand dame sprawled by a canal. The jeep stopped. I was out in a trice with my photography gear. The rest waited near the vehicle while I cautiously trod closer to the canal. I could see the tigress with her litter on the opposite bank of the ditch.  Soon, I was blissfully clicking away the tiger cubs, capturing them with my camera lens. Tiger cubs are said to be some of the most adorable and playful babies in the world, full of happy curiosity and energy. Watching the quartet was a heart-melting treat. I noticed a distinct change in the tiger\u2019s behaviour; I found them to be shy. The serenity of the atmosphere was pierced by an ear-splitting roar. Mamma Tigress was not pleased with my presence\u2026 a paparazzo! Anyone remotely interested in tigers knows that an adult tiger\u2019s roar can cause temporary paralysis in animals, including humans. Luckily, I could hear frantic voices calling out behind me. My friends from the forest department were shouting at the top of their lungs: \u201cBack off. Come back, come back.\u201d Having been a part of several forest expeditions and experienced close wildlife brushes, I quickly retreated and ran back to the jeep, only to learn that the tigress may have landed on top of me with just two jumps \u2014 into the ditch and out of it. I was spared her fury. This experience will be etched in my mind for many decades to come. Don\u2019t change\n       I lost my heart to Brahmapuri. It was thrilling that I was in tiger territory with nearly 100 predators of adults, sub-adults, and cubs prowling the area. Self-centred it may seem, I hope Brahmapuri remains as spellbinding as it is today, a hidden jewel somewhere in Western India. \n       \n         \n       \n         \n      ",

        "Article Content": "It\u2019s been 10 years since I went to Hiroshima but every August, I am reminded of the afternoon I spent at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. Since nuclear weapons testing began on July 16, 1945, over 2,000 have taken place, according to the United Nations. The world\u2019s first atomic bombing took place on August 6, 1945 in Hiroshima, and this museum in the capital of Hiroshima Prefecture in Japan is dedicated to documenting the atomic bombing of the city. In December 2009, the United Nations General Assembly declared August 29 as the International Day against Nuclear Tests. The move intends to increase awareness and education \u201cabout the effects of nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions and the need for their cessation as one of the means of achieving the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world\u201d.  Today, the only reminder of the bombing in Hiroshima is the Atomic Bomb Dome. Little Boy, which was the nickname of the bomb, detonated just above the dome of the building, which used to be a public hall. Officially known as the Hiroshima Peace Memorial or Genbaku Dome, this is a Unesco World Heritage Site. Through the efforts of many people, including those of the city of Hiroshima, it has been preserved in the same state as immediately after the bombing. It is not only a grim symbol of the most destructive force ever created by humankind but it also expresses the hope for world peace and the ultimate elimination of all nuclear weapons. At the museum, from which the Atomic Bomb Dome is clearly visible, you come across Shigeru Orimen\u2019s lunchbox. Shigeru was a first-year student at Second Hiroshima Prefectural High School. Three days after the bombing, his mother found a charred body holding the lunchbox. You can still see the charred remains of the food Shigeru never ate. Someone was sitting on the steps of a bank and waiting for it to open when the bomb detonated. The person must have died instantly. On display is the stone slab at the bank\u2019s entrance, which has a darker patch where the person was sitting. Also on display are watches that stopped at 8.15am on the day, the time of the detonation, and various other personal belongings of victims. Some other artefacts on display are starker \u2014 skin that fell off people\u2019s bodies in the heat, photographs of people with the darker parts of their clothes imprinted on their skin because of the heat. There is a \u2018before and after\u2019 model of the city with respect to the bombing. Because of its experiences in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, as a policy, does not possess, produce, or allow nuclear weapons into its territory. Successive mayors of Hiroshima have sent letters of protest for every nuclear test by any country since 1968. Copies of those letters are also on display. Among the receivers of the letter are former US President Barack Obama and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. The museum will disturb you. But if you are around Hiroshima, this is one place I recommend you visit.  Every single person on the planet should be aware of what human beings have done to their fellow human beings. The experience, hopefully, will inspire visitors to do whatever they can to ensure this bit of history never repeats itself.",

        "Article Content": "Perched at an altitude\nof 7887ft, Chatakpur is a hamlet around 20km away from Darjeeling. It is a\nsettlement of only 19 households with around 100 residents. Organic farming of\nvegetables in greenhouses is practised by most of the villagers, who also grow\nmedicinal herbs commercially.  The lush green mountain\nvillage that sprawls across the slope of a forested hillside is an idyllic\ngetaway to savour the majestic views of Mount Kanchenjunga and for the intrepid\ntraveller, a few trekking trails through the dense forest can add a bit of adventure\nquotient to a relaxed, tranquil holiday.  A leisurely hike through the leafy,\npicturesque terrain can reach you to the lofty heights of the Tiger Hill or to\nthe small town of Sonada for a quick visit to the colourful monastery and a\nbowl of steamed pork momos.  Mohan Rai, the owner of\nthe homestay where we had based ourselves for a three-day stay, accompanied us\nto Kalipokhri, a small waterbody where the villagers offer their prayers. The\n30-minute trail through the stately pine forest was filled with a woody aroma.\nThe breakfast hamper was put to good use on the paved embankments of\nKalipokhri. Mohan informed us that this waterbody, considered holy by the\nlocals, is home to quite a few Himalayan salamanders, one of the world\u2019s rarest\namphibians. The elusive salamanders did not show up though but we spotted a\ncouple of pink frogs, sitting in a meditative repose amid the golden silence.  On the way back to the\nvillage, Mohan recounted the story of Chatakpur. A couple of decades ago, the\nHimalayan village had been a timber smuggling hub, where most of its residents\nwere actively involved in the illicit trade. \u201cWe sat down and collectively\ndecided to put an end to the heinous crime of rampant cutting down of forest\ntrees,\u201d Mohan said. The villagers found themselves a unique livelihood instead.\n\u201cAlmost all the houses in Chatakpur boast of expansive mountain views,\u201d \u2013 Mohan\nsaid. The villagers converted their modest homesteads into homestays that not\nonly offered majestic snow views but also an intimate glimpse of the daily life\nof a mountain village.  That afternoon, Mohan\nshowed us around the village with its pristine patches of organic farmlands,\ngrowing local vegetables in greenhouses. They also grow medicinal herbs endemic\nto the Eastern Himalayan foothills. Mohan said that both these organic produce\nand the medicinal plants help the locals in promoting a sustainable livelihood.\n Our village trip ended\nat a local caf\u00e9 over a cuppa of aromatic Darjeeling tea, freshly picked from a\nnearby tea estate, and paired with an engaging conversation with the owner of\nthe caf\u00e9, an affable, middle-aged lady who also runs the adjacent guesthouse.  Early next morning, we\nset out for the hilltop viewpoint. From Mohan\u2019s homestay, the paved pathway\nmeandered through the village and ran into a steep stone staircase that wound\nits way up to the top, where a pagoda-like structure seemed to float amid the\nthick mist. We clambered our way up in silence, the rustle of leaves and the early\nmorning chirps of blue magpies keeping us company.  The view from the top\ntook our breath away. To our right, the village of Chatakpur resembled a\nChinese wash painting, its wooden, colourful cottages sitting in perfect\nharmony amid the alpine groves of oaks, pines and deodars, with the patches of\norganic farmlands, lending a soft, chequered base to the idyllic canvas. And to\nthe far left, high on the horizon, the mighty massif of Kanchenjunga stood\nagainst a pale blue sky, whiffs of smoky clouds swirling about its snow-laden\ncontours.  A strong wind blew in\nand as if on cue, the veil of mist thinned out to uncover the forest-clad\nlandscape, in radiant shades of green, below us. High above, the clouds\ndispersed for a few fleeting seconds, and Kanchenjunga revealed itself in all\nits dazzling white glory.  ",

The sanctuary is located in the southern trenches of the Western Ghats and is ranked 8th in the list of the world\u2019s biodiversity hotspots. Bibin Baby, a renowned and experienced naturalist in Wayanad, says, \u201cWayanad is a beautiful place for birding in the monsoons due to its thick evergreen vegetation, attracting frugivore and carnivorous birds in equal numbers. Besides birds, you can also see varieties of cicadas, grasshoppers, dragonflies, whitewater fish, frogs, and tadpoles.\u201d The region boasts about 250 species of birds.

From the majestic eagles soaring high above to the colourful warblers flitting through the undergrowth, Eaglenest offers an unforgettable experience for nature enthusiasts and bird watchers alike.

        "Article Content": "\u201c \u201d  \u2014 celebrated German writer Johann\nWolfgang von Goethe wrote about Bern in a letter to his friend in 1779. Not a lot has\nchanged since that letter was written. Switzerland\u2019s charming capital was\ndevastated in a fierce fire in 1405, but painstakingly rebuilt with grey\nsandstone and cobbled streets. While Goethe\u2019s Bern experience might have been\ncarefully planned and executed, I discovered Bern almost by sheer chance,\nthanks largely to Switzerland\u2019s efficient rail network. It\u2019s arguably the most\ndense rail network in the world and the Swiss capital is at the very heart of\nit. I broke away from my group headed to Zurich from   and\njumped aboard a Bern-bound train, almost on an impulse. I did join the group\nfor the Zurich bar crawl later that same evening. Switzerland\u2019s biggest city is\njust an hour away by train from Bern. The Swiss thrive on precision and\nplanning but my Swiss host ignored my impulsive streak given that Bern doesn\u2019t\nfigure very high on the travel wish lists of Indian travellers. After spending\na whole day there, I believe it should be. The best way to discover\nBern is to keep walking. I was comforted by the fact that almost all the city\u2019s\nhotspots were within a compact grid of utterly charming cobbled\nstreets. For almost an hour I walked aimlessly around a long grid of\ncovered arcades (the locals call them Lauben) that actually run around the city\ncentre for almost 6 kms. It\u2019s an eclectic mish-mash \u2014 quaint boutiques,\nhistoric cellars (a couple of them house upscale restaurants now), tiny\ncafes, designer stores, fountains and towering statues of Swiss folk figures.  I\nfell for a signboard with \u2018traditional Swiss cuisine\u2019 at Barenplatz and within\nminutes I polished off the most delish Swiss Roesti I\u2019ve ever eaten in\nSwitzerland.  The Parliament Building,\nthe seat of the Swiss government (Federal council) is probably the best place\nto begin. It\u2019s not just one of the city\u2019s most symbolic structures but the\nParliament square is a hub of activity, especially during weekends in the\nsummer. There\u2019s a water display with 26 fountains just in front of the complex\nto represent the 26 cantons that make up Switzerland. One of the most charming summertime things here is the sight of children playing around the fountain while families relax soaking in the sun around it.  The building is not Bern\u2019s most\nfamous landmark though. That honour probably belongs to the Zytglogge \u2014 the Clock\nTower, which served as the first Western gate of the city (between 1191 and\n1256). Blame it on the Swiss\nobsession with timekeeping, the Zytglogge\u2019s famous astronomical clock was built\nin 1530 and is one of the oldest in the country. Almost 500 years later,\nvisitors to Bern still crowd around the clock to watch the revolving figures\nturn just four minutes before the hour when the chimes commence. You can also\nsee late-Baroque elements in the exteriors of the tower, while the large dial\nis framed by a fresco produced by the well-known Bernese painter Victor Surbek\nin the 1930s. Local legends suggest that it was this very clock that was the\ncatalyst for Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity. Einstein spent a few years\nat the turn of the 20th century as a patent clerk in Bern. A small museum in\nthe heart of the old town pays tribute. It\u2019s impossible to\nescape the presence of Bern\u2019s M\u00fcnster (or Bern Minster) from any corner of the\nold town. It\u2019s Switzerland\u2019s largest ecclesiastical (religious) structure, with\na towering 100-meter-high spire. Construction started in 1421 and continued\nover a long period of time; the spire was finally completed in 1893. If you are\nwilling to make the 344-step climb up the spire, you will enjoy unhindered,\npanoramic views that stretch all the way to the snow-capped mountains of the\nBernese Oberland. Bern\u2019s cathedral and famous clock tower were instrumental in\nthe old town being conferred with \u2018UNESCO World Heritage Status\u2019 in 1983. While the cathedral\nmight boast of the best views from Bern, a trek up to the Rose Garden offers\nspectacular vistas of the city. Not far from this large public park is another\npopular outdoor family attraction \u2014 the Bear Park, where visitors can watch bears\nenjoy a near-natural habitat. The site was once home to a historic bear pit.\nBears have been part of the identity of Bern (the bear features on the canton\u2019s\nflag and coat of arms) but was modified into a more bear-friendly park.  The ascent to the Rose\nGarden begins near the bear park. The garden boasts of 220 types of roses and\n28 varieties of rhododendrons. It\u2019s the only spot where I made time to unwind\nafter a frenetic day and took in the views of the Old Town and the Aare Loop,\nwhere the river hugs the old town with its charming red roofs. It\u2019s possible to\ncapture Bern\u2019s Old Town with a single panorama shot from the Rose Garden but\nyou have to saunter around the cobbled streets to come to terms with Bern\u2019s\neclectic appeal. In a nation obsessed with timekeeping, Bern\u2019s Old Town is\nalmost frozen in time.",

        "Article Content": "\u2018Yogini\u2019 refers to a female master\npractitioner of tantra and yoga. It also refers to a female spiritual teacher\nin the Indian sub-continent and Tibet. They often appear in groups of 42, 64\nand 81 of which 64 is the most common combination. Even when there are 64 \u2018yoginis\u2019, these are not always the same. The shrines dedicated to the 64 \u2018yoginis\u2019 are known as Chausath Yogini temples. Several of these shrines are spread\nacross north and east India.  The Marble Rocks and Dhuandhar Waterfalls\nare the prime attraction of Jabalpur. Although located 25km south of Jabalpur\nin Bhedaghat, the Marble Rocks and Dhuandhar Waterfalls are considered as part\nof Jabalpur sightseeing. Every day, hundreds of tourists, including locals,\nvisit the thundering waterfalls and enjoy an amazing boat ride along the\nNarmada river, meandering through the towering marble cliffs. Sadly, majority\nof these tourists miss out the nearby Chausath Yogini Temple.  The Chausath Yogini Temple is\nlocated on a small hilltop overlooking the Narmada river and is approached by a\nlong flight of about 150 stairs. It follows a circular plan with inner and\nouter diameters measuring 116ft and 131ft, respectively. The circular courtyard\nhouses a shrine dedicated to Shiva and Parvati. The circular enclosure houses\n84 niches, out of which three operate as the two gateways of the complex. Two\nadjoining niches on the west serves as the bigger gates, while a single niche\non the southeast serves as the smaller gateway.  The circular structure was part of\nthe original temple and the central shrine came up almost two centuries later.\nIt was probably constructed by queen Alhanadevi, wife of Kalachuri king\nGayakarna, in 1155 AD. Known as Gouri Shankar temple, it contains the stone\nidol of Shiva and Parvati riding a bull. The temple is not located at the exact\ncentre of the complex but rather slightly to the south-east.  Eighty-one of the 84 niches (remaining\nthree are part of two gates) houses different statues, including those of the\nyoginis. According to some experts there are 64 \u2018yogini\u2019 statues, while the rest\nhouses Brahmanical deities like Shiva and Ganesha. Another school of experts\nopine that all the 81 house yoginis and it was actually an 81-yogini temple instead\nof a 64-yogini temple.  Also, according to experts, several\nof the statues presently displayed in the niches have been brought from ruined\ntemples nearby. It is also believed that several original yogini statues have\nbeen removed to other locations. So, these keep the visitors in the dark but\npresently almost all the statues are numbered and provided with name plates.  The \u2018yogini\u2019 and other statues\ndisplayed in the circular niches are in various forms of decay. Some have been\ndefaced and some have portions of their limbs missing. Some even are in\ncomplete decay with only portions of their lower body. It is believed that the\nstatues were defaced by intruders. According to legend, Muhammed Ghori came to\ndestroy the temple but was driven away by a swarm of bees.  Today, a large chunk of visitors\nvisiting the Marble Rocks and Dhuandhar Waterfalls miss out on this remarkable\nChausath Yogini Temple, where the stone speaks volume of the long-gone glorious\nera. The soothing surrounding greenery and the bird\u2019s-eye view of the\nmeandering Narmada are also not to be missed. ",

        "Article Content": "Not only cine stars but also politicians, bureaucrats, social figures and who\u2019s who have come and stayed at this lodge since 1966, when this private property, according to sources, started functioning as a tourist guest house. But here is an irony. While many cine stars have praised the tourism property for their pleasant stay, it is primarily the films that have largely contributed to its notorious reputation of being haunted. The films shot on its premises add to the mystique of Morgan House. Horror or suspense-thrillers such as  (shot in a separate wing but in the same compound),  and so on have all used Morgan House as their backdrop. The staff members believe that the eerie atmosphere created by these films has largely fuelled the common notion that the house is haunted. According to sources, Morgan House, a textbook example of British colonial architecture, was built by George Morgan, a jute merchant, in the 1930s. The two-storey bungalow, primarily made of stone and wood, is situated on an estate of 16 acres at the hilltop of Durpindara in Kalimpong district. \n After Morgan died in the early 1960s, his wife, \u201cMrs Morgan\u201d, continued to live here until she died of natural causes at Darjeeling District Hospital in 1964. As the couple didn\u2019t have any heir, the tourism department took the property\u2019s possession in 1965. Ten years later, it was handed over to the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation. Much later, stories began to circulate about the \u201cghost\u201d of \u201cMrs Morgan\u201d roaming in and around the house as if \u201cto ensure that everything is in order\u201d and \u201cwhether the guests have a pleasant stay\u201d. Chunku Lama, assistant manager of Morgan House, consistently dismisses the ghostly rumours. \u201cThese are baseless. Tourists would often question the creaking sounds heard at night and attribute those to supernatural activities. While in reality, the on-duty staff members would make their rounds to close the windows, turn off the corridor lights and ensure that the property is secure at night,\u201d says Lama. \u201cThe floors and stairs are made of wood, so it\u2019s natural to hear the echoes of footsteps all over the house located in such an isolated area,\u201d she says. \n Morgan House is secluded, located on the Kalimpong cantonment premises, with no nearby markets or habitation. Many believe that this desolation, coupled with an eerie silence of the surroundings, would lead people to imagine \u201cghosts\u201d while staying there. Once you step into the grand foyer, a chill might creep up your spine \u2014 but for no tangible reasons. The opulent interiors are not at all covered in thick dust, though they might whisper secrets of the past. Be assured that no cobwebs would cling to the chandeliers and no flickering light dancing across the faded floors \u2014 as this is a well-maintained tourism property. The air might be heavy, but only with the forgotten memories. The silence might feel oppressive, but there is nothing for one to uncover any \u201cdark secrets\u201d. \u201cActually, the set-up plays tricks on the mind. It\u2019s all about misperceptions or the play of light and shadow at night. The \u2018spectral figures\u2019 or \u2018ghost sightings\u2019 are all products of imagination. While in reality, someone must have spotted one of the staff members standing or doing some chores here and there in the property,\u201d says Subhankar Sarkar, guest attendant at this hotel. On top of it, there is the social media. Sources said tourists would come here, have their faces and hands painted in eerie colours and record Reels. Such videos and vlogs would go viral, further exaggerating and misinterpreting Morgan House\u2019s narrative. On a lighter tone and according to popular belief or misbelief, humans tend to turn into ghosts only if their deaths are unnatural, accidental or suicidal. \u201cIn any way, this cannot be the case with Morgan House. Mrs Morgan died a natural death, that too, in a hospital and not here,\u201d smiles the assistant manager. But folklore does not always go by the cause and effect theory. Vikash Lama, a driver who has ferried tourists to and from Morgan House several times, says: \u201cThough I have never \u2018seen\u2019 her, many locals believe that she still lives there. But don\u2019t you worry. She would never harm any tourists. Only those, who try to  trespass into the property or get there to do some notorious activities, especially at night, would face \u2018Mrs Morgan\u2019. She is actually the primary guardian of the house.\u201d But then again, a former employee of the tourist lodge, who had served here between 1983 and 1987 and again from 2003 to 2008, never had any spooky experience. \u201cIt\u2019s the best tourist lodge in Bengal. And I believe that tourists should focus more on this architectural marvel, its old-age charm rather than such rumours. During night shifts, I used to sleep there alone on many occasions. No spirits ever came to say \u2018Hello\u2019 to me,\u201d he says. Morgan House, a testament to the hill\u2019s colonial past, stands as a reminder of how legends can assume a life of their own. Ghosts or no ghosts \u2014 the echoes of history are definitely there, amplified by the imagination.",

        "Article Content": "The Centre on Tuesday directed the deployment of two additional CRPF battalions comprising around 2,000 personnel in Manipur amid a fresh wave of violence in the BJP-ruled state, sources in the Union home ministry said. Former army chief General Ved Malik said the violence in Manipur called for the imposition of President\u2019s Rule. \u201cThe situation in Manipur requires President\u2019s Rule and an effective Unified Command under the Governor,\u201d Malik, who was the army chief during the 1999 Kargil War, posted on X.   At least eight people have died and over 12 injured in the latest violence between suspected Kuki militants and Meitei village volunteers against the backdrop of a week of unprecedented drone and rocket attacks in the strife-hit state. Ethnic violence in Manipur, which erupted in May last year, has left at least 234 killed and over 60,000 displaced. \u201cThe two fresh battalions will be deployed in Kangvai (Churachandpur) while the second will be stationed around Imphal,\u201d a ministry official said, adding that battalion number 58 is being moved from Warangal in Telangana while No. 112 is being sent from Latehar in Jharkhand. Recently, two Assam Rifles battalions from Manipur were withdrawn for operational duties in Jammu and Kashmir and some other parts of the Northeast. As many as 16 battalions of the CRPF are already present in the state since the violence erupted last year. There were about 10-11 CRPF battalions in Manipur before the violence broke out. A CRPF battalion has an operational strength of about 1,000 personnel. \u201cThe CRPF will have a lead role in Manipur as fresh units of the force have been rushed to the state since the violence broke out between the Meiteis and the Kukis last year in May. The deployment of the two additional battalions is meant to strengthen  the force,\u201d the home ministry official said. The two units have personnel who have undergone training in internal security duties. They will require logistical, housing, equipment and anti-drone technology support and that is being planned, the official said. Sources said a joint team of officers drawn from the CRPF, the BSF and some independent technical experts would reach Manipur later this week to conduct an \u201canalytical study\u201d of the drones and improvised rockets that have been used to launch attacks in some regions of the state over the last few days. The CRPF has been dealing with improvised Maoist-fired rockets called barrel grenade launchers in areas hit by Left-wing extremism.  They will study the rockets that are being used in Manipur. The BSF has a forensic lab to analyse drones coming in from the Pakistan border to states such as Punjab  and Rajasthan. Currently, Manipur\u2019s security adviser Kuldiep Singh is heading the Unified Command, which plans and executes steps to monitor the law-and-order situation and related issues in the state. On Monday, thousands of students protested in front of the Manipur secretariat and the Raj Bhavan, demanding action against those behind the drone and missile attacks and calling for the protection of the state\u2019s \u201cterritorial and administrative integrity\u201d. The protesters demanded the resignation of director-general of police (DGP) Rajiv Singh and Kuldiep Singh for their alleged failure to control the violence. ",

Curfew, which was imposed in the state's capital Imphal on Tuesday afternoon, continued to be in place this morning, while additional security forces were deployed and frequent patrolling by policemen was underway in the town to avoid any untoward incident, a senior officer said. \"The situation remains tense but under control,\" he said. A clash broke out between students and security forces during a march to the Raj Bhavan here on Tuesday. The government on Tuesday evening issued an amended order, stating that the suspension of internet services in the wake of intensified agitation by students applies only to the five valley districts.  \tThe agitating students attempted to march towards the Raj Bhavan in Imphal to press for their demands to remove the DGP and security advisor to the state government. The police had fired tear gas shells to disperse students who were accused of pelting security forces with stones in Khwairamband and Kakwa Naorem Leikai areas in the state capital. More than 55 students were injured in the clashes and admitted to RIMS hospital, a students' body claimed. The Raj Bhavan, in a statement issued late on Tuesday night, said, \"Representatives of students met Governor Lakshman Prasad Acharya and submitted a memorandum.\" \tThey urged the governor to take up appropriate steps to fulfil their demands, it said. The governor assured them that he would take steps in the best interest of the students and the people of Manipur, the statement said. Meanwhile, search operations and area domination exercises were underway in Kangpokpi district and arms and explosives were recovered, police said in a statement. ",

Manipur University has also postponed all postgraduate and undergraduate examinations till further orders. Acharya, who is the governor of Assam with additional charge of Manipur, left the state for Guwahati around 10 am, officials told PTI without divulging further details. More than 55 students and security personnel received minor injuries during the clash on Tuesday near the Raj Bhavan. The agitators were demanding removal of the DGP and security advisor to the state government for their alleged inability to deal with the law and order situation in Manipur, where drones and rockets were used recently in the ethnic violence. Hours after the clash near Raj Bhavan, the governor met 11 student representatives on Tuesday night. Police said that no fresh protests and violence were reported on Wednesday in Imphal valley where curfew was imposed and internet services were suspended. Security has been tightened in the region with deployment of additional forces and barricading of sensitive areas in the state capital. On Tuesday, security forces fired tear gas shells to disperse protesting students who defied prohibitory orders and attempted to overpower police personnel to reach the Raj Bhavan besides engaging in stone-throwing at BT Road and Kakwa area in Imphal. The students had been protesting since Monday morning and also had camped the night in the market areas of Khwairamband. Meanwhile, Chief Minister N Biren Singh said he met students of Imphal College and Ibotonsana Higher Secondary School and assured them that his government is committed to address the issues faced by the state. \u201cThey (students) voiced their concerns regarding the ongoing disturbances in our state, and I truly value their input.

Bimol Akoijam from strife-hit Manipur has reminded Union home minister Amit Shah about the Centre\u2019s \u201chistorical, political, moral and legal responsibility to defend\u201d the state. In a six-page representation to Shah on Tuesday, the first-time Lok Sabha MP said the \u201cunprecedented violent crisis in my home state\u201d that evokes \u201cmemories of the Partition of India in 1947\u201d has \u201cfurther taken a dangerous turn, with the loss of lives and property as a result of aerial attacks, reportedly/involving weaponised drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and rockets/missiles\u201d. While requesting Shah to take \u201cimmediate corrective measures and other necessary steps to restore peace and normalcy\u201d in the state, Bimol has drawn the attention of Shah \u201cto a moment in history to understand why such an assault on Manipur must not be allowed by the government of India\u201d. The Opposition MP turned the pages of history, pointing out that as \u201cBritish India\u201d and the \u201cnative states\u201d came together to constitute \u201cthis great country of ours in 1947, Manipur was one of those states\u201d. In the process, the then Maharajah of Manipur, Shri Bodhchandra, handed over the defence of Manipur to the government of India through the Instrument of Accession, which he signed on August 11, 1947. \u201cThis historical obligation is embedded in Article 355 of our present Constitution as well without subverting what Dr B.R. Ambedkar called the \u2018sovereign and plenary\u2019 authority of the constituting states. Therefore, the government of India has a historical, political, moral and legal responsibility to defend Manipur,\u201d he said. Bimol\u2019s letter to Shah came amid the volatile situation triggered by the September 1 aerial strikes leading to intense protests in the five valley districts, which were placed under curfew on Tuesday. After two days of intense protests, under-curfew Imphal valley was relatively calmer on Wednesday. There were a couple of protests but not of the same intensity as was witnessed on Tuesday. At a news conference in Delhi, the Congress leadership of Manipur questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s intent in allowing the situation to fester for 16 months without any intervention from him, wondering why he is not showing the same concern that he has for the Russia-Ukraine conflict to the strife-torn state. \u201cHe has time to travel to different parts of the world and the country but has not found the time to visit Manipur since violence began there over a year ago,\u201d the Congress said.",

The ten hospitalised persons are detained at the Matia Detention Centre in Goalpara district. Their condition is stable. One of the hospitalised inmates told a Goalpara resident the \u201cIndian government should allow us to live in India or allow us to die as refugees\u201d. He had been under detention for seven years.  The hunger strike continued on Wednesday.  An official told  there are 103 Rohingyas, including 39 minors,  and 32 Chin refugees from Myanmar, in the Matia camp which became operational last year. He also said the adult members were convicted under Indian law for illegally entering India and were handed terms ranging terms two to three years. They were sent to the Matia camp last year after having served their respective jail terms.   \u201cThe state government is taking up the issue with the MEA and the MHA for deportation because India is not a signatory to the UNCHR convention. Therefore, we don\u2019t recognise refugees in India. For us, they remain a security threat to the nation. Of late, the Assam government has intensified efforts to curb infiltration through the international border,\u201d the official said.   Infiltration has been a sensitive issue in Assam since the seventies. The issue of the hunger strike attracted attention after  the Delhi-based non-profit  NGO \u2014 Rohingya Human Rights Initiative (R4R) \u2014  flagged the hunger strike issue on Tuesday through a statement which said the organisation was \u201canguished by the heart-wrenching plight of Myanmar refugees, including Rohingya and Chin, who have been driven to the extreme measure of a hunger strike in the Matia Detention Centre in Assam, India.\u201d \u201cThis desperate act of protest reflects their unbearable struggle against indefinite detention, where their fundamental human rights have been systematically denied,\u201d the statement said. The rights body said that of those detained 40 possess refugee cards issued by UNHCR, India. \u201cAcross India, the situation is no less grim, with nearly 1,000 Rohingya refugees, including 200 children, separated from their families and held in detention.

        "Article Content": "Congress MP from Inner Manipur A Bimol Akoijam has written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, expressing deep anguish over the \"unprecedented violent crisis\" in Manipur and called for \"corrective measures\" such as ensuring that the security forces act decisively to rein in the violence. In his letter to Shah on Tuesday, Akoijam also called for thoroughly investigating the allegations of involvement by illegal immigrants, foreign elements and illicit drug mafia in the present crisis. He wrote that the current situation in Manipur evokes memories of the partition of India in 1947, which is especially painful given the government's recent efforts to commemorate August 14 as \"Partition Horrors Remembrance Day\", and said Shah would also have been deeply hurt if the same were to happen to Gujarat. \"It is distressing that such a severe crisis has unfolded under the present administration's watch,\" he said. \"It pains me to bring this reminder to you that this violence has led to the loss of precious human lives in hundreds and about 60,000 people have been rendered homeless. \"Just as I write this letter, not only thousands of those internally displaced persons (IDPs) are still languishing in relief camps under deplorable conditions but this unprecedented violence has also remained unabated to date,\" Akoijam said. In fact, the violence has further taken a dangerous turn, with the loss of lives and property as a result of aerial attacks, reportedly involving weaponised drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and rockets/missiles, the Congress MP said in his letter to Shah. \"Besides, there have been reports of extortion and other forms of crime. Consequently, the livelihoods of the people and the economy of the state in general have also been severely affected by prolonged violence and lawlessness, he said. \"I often wonder whether such a violent crisis would have been allowed to linger for so long if it had involved the so-called 'mainstream' or 'mainland' India (such as in states like UP, Bihar, Punjab, Maharashtra). \"Indeed, I deeply regret that the lives of the people in Manipur do not seem to matter to this government of India, of which you are a prominent leader,\" Akoijam said. \"I am sure that you would have been deeply hurt if the same case were to happen to Gujarat, your own home state, like any other Gujarati would have understandably felt,\" he said. Akoijam called for immediate \"corrective measures\" and other necessary steps to restore peace and normalcy in the state of Manipur. He urged Shah to ensure that the security forces act decisively and judiciously to rein in the violence. \"Investigate reports of the units of security agencies/forces acting in a partisan manner during the ongoing crisis, and take steps to address trust deficits and ensure accountability if the allegations are found to be true,\" he said in his letter to Shah. Akoijam called for rejecting the \"exclusivist identity politics which is fuelling the crisis\" by firmly and categorically declaring that administrative reforms can be entertained only to ensure that public goods and services are delivered effectively and fairly to the people, rather than \"reinforcing exclusivist identities that create divisions in society and polity\". Akoijam also called for the inquiry committee, established in June 2023 and headed by former Chief Justice of the Gauhati High Court Ajai Lamba to complete its work and release its findings without further delay. He urged Shah to take concrete steps to address the suffering of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and ensure their resettlement in their original homes with dignity and well-being. He called for restoring the free movement of goods and people on the highways with full security by implementing measures, including the deployment of adequate armed forces. \"Additionally, as the economy of Manipur has been devastated by this violence, urgently address the issue of fiscal relief, including tax exemptions, with the relevant ministry,\" he said. Akoijam also called for thoroughly investigating the allegations of involvement by illegal immigrants, foreign elements and illicit drug mafia in the present crisis. If found to be true, take necessary steps to check and repel such involvement, he added. The Congress MP said necessary institutional and judicious measures are needed to delineate citizens from non-citizens in the state. Akoijam also called for a review of existing policies and measures with armed groups, particularly the controversial Suspension of Operations (SoO) with the \"Kuki\" armed groups in the state, to ensure that such measures do not become a breeding ground for violence and illegal activities. He also batted for initiating dialogue among the people and healing processes to address the trauma caused by this unprecedented tragedy in the state. Akoijam's remarks come amid an escalation of violence in Manipur. The state government on Tuesday suspended internet services in five valley districts amid intensified agitation by students. The decision was taken to curb the use of social media for transmission of images, hate speech and hate video, the state home department said in a notification. Also, prohibitory orders were imposed in three districts of Manipur. An indefinite curfew, preventing people from coming outside their houses, was clamped in Imphal East and West districts, while prohibitory orders under Section 163 (2) of BNSS were imposed in Thoubal. Clashes between Meitei and Kukis have left over 200 people dead and thousands homeless since May last year.",

        "Article Content": "A primary health centre was torched by unidentified persons in a fresh incident of arson in Jiribam district of Manipur on Thursday, officials said. The incident took place in Borobekra, less than 200 metres from a police outpost, early in the morning, they said. No injuries were reported as nobody was inside the primary health centre at the time of the incident. Security forces have rushed to the spot. Neso, an umbrella organisation of students\u2019 bodies from the Northeast region, on Thursday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene to end the ongoing violence in Manipur. The \u201cfailure\u201d to address the conflict not only undermines the \u201cstability\u201d of Manipur but also poses \u201ca threat\u201d to the broader peace and security of the entire Northeast, Neso chairman Samuel Jyrwa said. \u201cTime and again, Neso has appealed to the government of India and the Prime Minister to intervene decisively in this matter,\u201d Jyrwa said. \u201cThe prolonged silence of the Prime Minister, who was yet to visit Manipur since the violence erupted, has only served to aggravate the crisis,\u201d he said. According to Neso, the absence of strong, timely leadership and intervention has allowed the conflict to fester, further escalating the violence and suffering endured by the people. Jyrwa said that \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d was the only way forward where the rights, aspirations and dignity of every individual were respected and upheld. He said that Manipur\u2019s people deserve peace, which can only be achieved through mutual understanding and a commitment to non-violence. Jyrwa said Neso believes that violence can never be the solution to any conflict, and \u201cwe call upon all communities and stakeholders to embrace dialogue and work together towards restoring peace and sought to assure the government that Neso stands ready to assist in any constructive efforts to resolve the ongoing crisis and ensure a stable, secure future for Manipur\u201d. Ethnically diverse Jiribam, which was largely untouched by the ethnic violence in Imphal Valley and the adjoining hills, witnessed fresh violence on September 7 after a 59-year-old man belonging to one community was killed allegedly by militants of another community in June this year. Five people were killed in the incident. At least 234 people have been killed and over 6,000 rendered homeless in the ethnic violence between Imphal Valley-based Meiteis and the adjoining hills-based Kuki-Zo groups since May 3 last year. A CRPF jawan was also killed in an ambush by militants during patrolling by security forces in mid-July.",

        "Article Content": "Escalating protests led by students against the unending turmoil in Manipur have prompted the BJP government to impose an indefinite curfew in five valley districts, a five-day ban on Internet services and the closure of schools and colleges till Thursday. The Centre on Tuesday directed the deployment of two additional CRPF battalions comprising around 2,000 personnel in Manipur. Former army chief General Ved Malik said the violence in Manipur called for the imposition of President\u2019s rule.  The government imposed the curfew around 11am on Tuesday apprehending breach of peace as a large number of students hit the streets at multiple locations against the authorities, their ire mostly directed at the Centre. The students demanded the restoration of peace. An unspecified number of students were injured in tear-gassing by the security forces.  Students clashed with security personnel as they tried to enter VIP areas in Imphal West district, resulting in the firing of tear-gas shells and a lathicharge.  At the Khwairamband Ima (mothers\u2019) market, women and students wanted to march to the Raj Bhavan after the students\u2019 24-hour deadline to address their concerns ended.  A 10-member students\u2019 group had on Monday submitted a memorandum to governor L.P. Acharya and subsequently set a 24-hour deadline. The students stayed the night at the market and hit the streets after the expiry of their deadline. As the protesters began marching towards the Raj Bhavan, the forces used tear gas, mock bombs and batons to quell them. The students retaliated by hurling  stones, bottles and damaged bicycles.   Around 3pm, the governor issued a statement appealing for peace. As the situation turned volatile, he met an 11-member students\u2019 delegation at 6pm. The governor pledged to do whatever is possible in the \u201cbest interest of the students and people of Manipur\u201d. Imphal valley has been witnessing protests since September 1 after drone bombings in Imphal West. The agitation intensified after the rocket bomb attack in Bishnupur and the gunfight in Jiribam in which six people were killed. It had also forced the chief minister and ruling MLAs to meet the governor on Sunday. The trigger for the students issuing the 24-hour deadline was, according to sources, the lack of response to the charter of demands submitted on Monday afternoon. Sources said the students had demanded the removal of the DGP and the security adviser and handing over of the charge of the Unified Command to the chief minister and the elected government. Kuldiep Singh heads the Unified Command. The protesters also said the central forces must leave as they have been \u201cmute spectators\u201d. The chief minister-led delegation had on Sunday also submitted a memorandum to the governor requesting the transfer of the charge of the Unified Command to the state government. From the nature of the protests and the demands, it is clear the ire is directed more at the Centre than at the state government, sources said. Kuldiep Singh and DGP Rajiv Singh were appointed on the \u201crecommendation\u201d of the Centre, they said.   The sources said the Centre was in a bind because the Kuki-Zos would oppose the handing over of the Unified Command to the Biren Singh government. Kuki-Zos are also protesting the move to replace the Assam Rifles battalions in the state, as the Meiteis want.  At Kakwa in Imphal West, there was a flare-up between security personnel and Manipur University students around 2pm. They staged a protest under the aegis of the Cocomi Students\u2019 Front, protesting the state\u2019s and the Centre\u2019s \u201cineffectiveness\u201d in controlling the violence in the state that erupted on May 3, 2023, leaving at least 234 dead and over 60,000 displaced.  They burnt effigies of Union home minister Amit Shah, DGP Rajiv Singh and security adviser Kuldiep Singh at the university gate.",

        "Article Content": "The IIT Guwahati administration on Wednesday held a meeting on how to \u201cimprove\u201d student-teacher ties in the wake of the protests held following the death of a third-year B. Tech Computer Science student on Sunday night. It was the second death by hanging at the premier institute this year. A IITG source told  that the director had convened a meeting of administration staff to brief the latter about the developments following the tragedy and how things could be improved,  one of which included \u201cbridging the gap between the student and the faculty\u201d. \u201cIt was a fruitful hour-long discussion in the afternoon. The authorities will take steps to further improve the academic environment and mental well-being of the students. The overall sentiment was that the student protest on Monday and Tuesday overshadowed the tragedy which should not have been the case,\u201d the sources said. The staff meeting follows the one the director held with the protesting students on Tuesday, lasting from 4.30pm to 10pm, where the students submitted an eight-point charter of demands. The demands included revisiting the \u201cattendance policy as well as professor sensitisation\u201d.  The stringent attendance policy, a student said, was a cause of mental distress as well as the \u201cbehaviour\u201d of some faculty members towards students.    The IITG did not allow entry to journalists on Wednesday following reports that the institute\u2019s Dean (academic affairs) K.V. Krishna resigned following the protest, the development indicating the impact of the student protest. The resignation has not been accepted yet. The institute said: \u201cMembers of the media are requested not to visit the campus now. The institute assures you that the situation is being treated with utmost urgency and media will soon be invited to the campus for a meeting with the director. We request members of the press to understand and co-operate with us in these difficult times and give us a few days to bring the situation back to normalcy and invite you to campus for a briefing.\u201d Before  Wednesday\u2019s meeting, the IITG also said: \u201cIIT Guwahati acknowledges the deep distress caused by the recent unfortunate incident of a student death on campus and understands the concerns of the student community. The well-being of everyone remains our top priority, and we are fully committed to fostering a safe and supportive environment for all.\u201d \u201cWhile understanding and acknowledging the concerns of the students, it is crucial to prioritise academic continuity and maintain a peaceful campus. Therefore, we request all to refrain from protests and return to their classrooms,\u201d another statement said.",

        "Article Content": "Leader of the Opposition in Assam assembly Debabrata Saikia on Thursday alleged that Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma violated court orders by not issuing notice for eviction from government land at Sonapur in Kamrup Metropolitan district. Saikia said there is a ruling by both the Supreme Court and Gauhati High Court that the government should give prior notice before eviction. \u201cThis is required even in the case of eviction from government land, but the chief minister is claiming that no such notice is required,\u201d the Congress MLA told reporters. The CM is trying to \u201cmislead people by violating court orders and has also gone against the Constitution\u201d, Saikia claimed. He also expressed surprise over Sarma\u2019s allegation that the ''Congress party, and particularly myself, have been instigating the evicted persons to protest against government action. This is a complete lie''. Moreover, according to information sought through an RTI, the Sonapur Circle Officer had categorically stated on August 29, when the assembly was in session, that there is no encroachment on government land, Saikia said. \u201cI had asked whether any eviction had taken place in the area and he had replied in the negative, but all of a sudden, I came across a news that eviction was going on,\u201d the opposition leader said. The Kamrup Metropolitan district authorities had launched an eviction drive in Kochutoli village under Sonapur circle, which turned violent on Thursday, with protesters attacking with sharp weapons, sticks and stones and the police retaliating with firing, leading to the death of two persons.",

        "Article Content": "Imagine the daily routine of a teacher \u2014 waking up early to plan lessons, standing for hours in front of eager faces, managing administrative tasks, and navigating the complexities of parent-teacher meetings. Evenings are often spent grading assignments and preparing for the next day, while weekends \u2014 supposedly a time for rest and relaxation\u2014 are largely consumed by school events and training sessions. This relentless cycle leaves many teachers on the verge of burnout. During my time as a Teach For India fellow, I saw the immense challenges faced by teachers up close. I observed teachers who spent most of their day on their feet, tirelessly teaching class after class, often without the luxury of a proper break. I remember the exhaustion in their eyes as they corrected papers during their lunch hours, knowing that their timetable was packed with six to seven classes daily. I saw the frustration when they were assigned non-teaching duties like election postings, duties that pulled them away from their students and classrooms. And when the Covid-19 pandemic struck, I saw how teachers were expected to step into the roles of frontline workers, managing vaccination counts on top of their already overwhelming workloads. This is the reality for 9.5 million teachers across India, working in 1.48 million schools. The State of Teachers, Teaching and Teacher Education in India 2023 (SoTTTER 2023) reveals that 40 per cent of government school teachers feel overwhelmed with their workload, which includes data maintenance and administrative duties. The situation isn\u2019t much better in the private sector, where 18 to 20 per cent of teachers express similar feelings of being overwhelmed. For both groups, 24 to 25 per cent report that this burden has significantly impacted their mental and physical health. Alarmingly, 38 per cent of government teachers and 25 per cent of private teachers lack adequate support networks, leaving them to navigate these challenges in isolation.  So, if we expect teachers to care for our children, who is caring for the teachers? , which emphasises the importance of understanding and managing emotions, building healthy relationships and developing social awareness, isn\u2019t just for students. It\u2019s a lifeline for teachers, too. As an SEL consultant during the Covid-19 pandemic, I trained teachers on trauma-informed care. Through countless conversations, I identified the burnout and emotional exhaustion they were experiencing. SEL initiatives were almost always student-focussed, with teachers expected to implement these strategies. And yet, rarely was there a focus on their own emotional well-being. My master\u2019s dissertation deepened my understanding of this issue. I studied how a teacher\u2019s social-emotional competence directly affects the classroom climate, and the findings were clear \u2014 teachers play a pivotal role in shaping how a child feels and learns. When teachers are burned out and lack the skills to manage their stress, it negatively impacts students\u2019 joy and learning experience. This reinforced my belief that we urgently need to support our teachers. They cannot be expected to be everything at once \u2014 educators, counsellors, administrators \u2014 without proper support. When teachers develop strong SEL skills, they are better equipped to understand and respond to their students\u2019 emotional needs. They can recognise signs of distress, offer the necessary support and create a classroom environment where students feel safe and valued. This improves student behaviour and enhances academic performance. Moreover, teachers with strong SEL skills are more likely to enjoy their jobs, stay in their careers longer and avoid burnout. In a profession plagued by high stress and turnovers, focusing on SEL could be a game-changer, leading to a more stable and fulfilling teaching environment. India faces an urgent need to integrate SEL into BEd programmes as well as teacher training. This means revising BEd curricula to include SEL with a focus on emotional resilience and stress management. We must embed well-being practices into ongoing teacher training programmes, incorporating mindfulness, time management and stress-reduction techniques. SEL cannot be meaningfully carried out in the absence of school counsellors and peer support groups. Throughout my experience, I\u2019ve seen teachers carrying the emotional burdens of their students, often with little to no support. Schools should hire trained counsellors who can provide direct support to both students and teachers. Regular SEL workshops and peer support groups should be put in place to foster a community where teachers can share experiences and coping strategies, alleviating some of their emotional strain. The next step is simplifying access to SEL resources. I have noticed that SEL is referred to by various names \u2014 such as life skills, 21st century skills, and holistic education \u2014 which creates confusion about its purpose and practice. To address this, we need to develop and provide clear, accessible resources. Offering practical tools like blogs, videos and toolkits that define and demonstrate SEL practices will help teachers integrate these essential skills effectively into their classrooms and personal lives. Parents are also a vital stakeholder when it comes to teachers and their students. Engaged parents and a positive work environment are critical to teacher satisfaction and effectiveness. Structured Parent-Teacher Meetings (PTMs) and School Management Committee (SMC) meetings should not just focus on academic performance but also include discussions around student and teacher well-being. These conversations can gradually build a deeper understanding among parents and communities about the pressures teachers face and the importance of supporting their emotional health. Lastly, students must be taught about the impact of their actions on the well-being of teachers. Teaching students to understand the emotional impact of their actions on teachers can create a more empathetic and cooperative classroom environment, ultimately contributing to a healthier and more supportive school culture. Implementing teacher-focused SEL interventions is not without its challenges. Mental health remains stigmatised in India, complicating efforts to support teacher well-being. Additionally, the shortage of trained mental health professionals and limited budgets further hinder these initiatives. Compounding the problem is how the prevalent school culture does not prioritise SEL, leading to its superficial or misaligned implementation. Despite these obstacles, I believe that the long-term benefits of investing in teacher SEL far outweigh the challenges. A well-supported teacher is more likely to be effective, motivated and capable of inspiring students. By prioritising teacher well-being, we can ensure that educators are not just surviving but thriving in their roles. Let\u2019s make teacher well-being a priority \u2014 not just on Teachers\u2019 Day, but every single day.",

        "Article Content": "Waking up at 7am on weekdays to brush and rush to school may not be the most fun activity ever. But, once you\u2019re in the classroom, watching your favourite teacher explain maths using letters or explaining what mitochondria are (we\u2019re not going there), waking up early seems less of a chore. And after one passes out from school, it is these classroom moments one remembers and you reminisce that bond you shared with your teachers.  To capture these magical moments,   lists a few advertisements that have highlighted these special bonds over the years. Do we remember our first teacher in school? Or, do teachers remember their first batch? Parle-G captured this emotion in a touching film where a retiring teacher's dream of meeting her first batch again finally comes true. A girl from the class of 2025 notices her teacher admiring the trees in the school garden. When she asks why, the teacher reveals that each tree represents a student from her first batch in 1995. Inspired, the student surprises her by reuniting her with that very batch as a heartfelt farewell gift. Each child has their own learning curve, a concept beautifully illustrated in this Aditya Birla Group ad. A little girl in class is often distracted, gazing out the window instead of focussing on lessons. Noticing this, her teacher asks what fascinates her outside. The girl mentions the sky, birds and trees. The teacher then cleverly connects this interest to books, explaining that they offer even more to explore. Inspired, the girl later chooses to read her book on the bus instead of gazing out the window, embracing her new \u2018Window to the World.\u2019 One of the most heartwarming gestures an ex-student can make, even amidst a busy life, is to wish the teachers who shaped them. Bandhan Bank captured this beautifully in an ad where a group of former classmates surprises their teacher on a video call for Teachers\u2019 Day. The ad begins with a son asking his mother, a teacher, if she remembers her students. She fondly recalls her 1999 batch, and just as she wishes they\u2019d reach out, her son surprises her with a video call from the entire class, bringing back nostalgic memories. Teachers often step in as second parents, whether it\u2019s tending to a wound, solving problems, or dealing with tiffin issues. This nurturing role is highlighted in a Sunfeast Mom\u2019s Magic biscuit ad. After class, while everyone heads to lunch, one boy stays behind to finish his homework. When his teacher asks why he isn\u2019t joining, he reveals that his father was too rushed to pack his lunch. The teacher then gently shares that she also forgot her tiffin and invites him to enjoy lunch together, offering comfort and care and, of course, the biscuit pack. The pressure to achieve top marks can be overwhelming, especially for students who aren\u2019t naturally academically inclined. In 2016, Bournvita launched its Badam Booster with the \u2018Tayyari Har Exam Ki\u2019 campaign, encouraging parents to prioritise learning over report card numbers. The ad features a school principal addressing parents, reminding them that she only scored 58% in school yet became a principal. She emphasises that marks are just numbers, and the true focus should be on the love of learning. This ad is both humbling and hopeful for students who struggle academically. Many of us fondly remember Titan\u2019s \u2018The Joy of Gifting\u2019 ad from a decade ago. In this memorable commercial, students in a classroom surprise their professor by spontaneously breaking into an a cappella performance of the Titan theme, using desks and books as instruments. The professor, initially confused, is touched when a student presents him with a scrapbook filled with well-wishes for his retirement, along with a Titan watch. This heartfelt gesture brings tears to his eyes and likely stirs similar emotions in viewers, inspiring them to reconnect with their own teachers.",

        "Article Content": "\u201cThey must have taken an easy subject\u201d, \u201cThere is no future in anything other than engineering\u201d, \u201cCreative fields do not have money\u201d. There are other examples. I am sure you have heard a few. These comments represent a mindset that is not amenable to change. Such a mindset thrives on ignoring someone\u2019s success, usually because it is too uncomfortable to stomach. It is about ignoring one component of life so that the convenient one can be acknowledged. A great example of this is the distinct lack of support from armchair commentators for India\u2019s Paralympic Games performance. They are the people who flooded social media, demanding a silver for Vineesh Phogat and criticising Neeraj Chopra for not winning gold. Yet, as of writing, when India is in the top-20 in the Paris Paralympic Games, having won 20 medals, three of them gold, few of them are speaking about it. Bravo to the entire paralympic contingent! We have all been jealous. It is a fundamental part of the growing-up experience. We have all had people around us who have been jealous. We have had people blocking out or dismissing our success or happiness because they have been jealous. We have been jealous of others ourselves. So what does being jealous mean? Jealousy is a complex emotion that involves our sense of having and not having. It is complex because it encompasses our assessment of situations, our feelings and typically, our actions prompted by these feelings. It often involves envy, insecurity and minor to major resentments. Jealousy is a learned pattern. It starts when people feel threatened because they perceive that the resources they need to survive are going to someone else. A common example of this is when parents spend more time with a sibling or a coach or teacher gives more attention to someone else.  But all jealousy is not equal. Like chips in a packet, jealousy comes in different shapes and sizes. But all the types are linked to wanting something that you feel you deserve. One of the types is associated with love. Not just romantic love, but also love for a sport or a career or similar things. This type more often leads to toxicity, instead of harmonious passion.  The first type is called \u2018cognitive jealousy\u2019, which is associated with the thought processes of suspicion or insecurity. This type makes us \u2018worried\u2019 or \u2018suspicious\u2019 of someone doing something that will benefit them and hurt us. This also makes us look at imagined scenarios. For example, a senior athlete keeps an eye on all the juniors because if one of them matches his performance, then his funding from the government will be threatened. He is even more worried when a hotshot junior bags the silver medal in the nationals. You would think this is made up, but sadly, it isn\u2019t.  The second type is \u2018doing\u2019 jealousy-driven things at a behavioural level. This involves actively harming someone or pulling them down to protect oneself. This type of jealousy forces someone to get over-involved with the people they are insecure about in order to feel good about themselves. This typically comes from an ingrained natural fear of losing (status, love, power, success, etc.). Behavioural jealousy does not offer a sense of security, instead, it stifles freedom and autonomy because the jealous person can escalate matters to harm others. The athlete in the previous example actively conspired against the upcoming junior and got him removed from teams, harming the junior\u2019s career. The last kind is \u2018emotional jealousy\u2019, which springs from a place of love and care. It comes from the human instinct to protect something you hold dear and cherish. In small doses, emotional jealousy shows how invested you are in something. As someone told me yesterday, \u201cthis is not the kind of love that will be destructive\u201d. But the excessive presence of emotions and jealousy leads to a kind of attachment that consumes the person. Excessive emotional jealousy leads to the relationship, whether with a sport or a person, becoming self-serving. The bigger picture is forgotten. If you do well, rather than supporting and congratulating you, people will ask themselves and others questions. How did you \u2018manage\u2019 it? Did you get lucky? Was there some \u2018connection\u2019 helping you out? Accepting and acknowledging your hard work is usually last on the list, if at all. It should be the first on your list and that is all. Jealousy distracts us from our controllable actions and switches our focus to what others are doing. Looking at someone\u2019s car instead of the road while driving leads to a crash. Might be something to think about when we get jealous.   ",

        "Article Content": "Creativity and precision, modernity and tradition, dance and mime came together in a unique production,  which was presented by two dancers, Rikhia Basu and Nilanjana Banerjee, and the veteran mime artist, Suvendu Mukhopadhyay, at Gyan Manch recently. The Manipuri style of Basu and Banerjee was fluid and tranquil, perfectly juxtaposing with mime, the second element of the performance. Together, their creative endeavour \u2014 fragments of a narrative that underlines rising human isolation and the central role that technological innovations play in breaking down human bonds \u2014 foregrounded the primacy of the body and the mind as vessels for experience and expression. If Banerjee stood out for her innate aesthetic sense and her intricate footwork, Basu's ability to convey a wide range of emotions bore the narratorial load of the performance. Both performers wore Manipuri dance attires but were shorn of the embellishments. Conceptualised by Banerjee, the small but insightful segments \u2014 how the blissful camaraderie among three friends is ruined owing to phone usage, how a daughter not allowed to practise dance by her strict father ends up taking her own life, how the happiness of conjugality is cut short by the pandemic \u2014 were etched out with  and dance. The rest of the performance, including the mime, used minimal music. There were no songs either, heightening a silence that symbolised forced or self-induced seclusion. A special note should be made of the innovative usage of the overhead stage lights that added to the dramatic component. Clarity was missing in a few patches given that the performers engaged in multi-rolling for different strands of the narrative. The performance reached its narrative peak with the introduction of a child who symbolises the promise of a happy future untouched by human as well as technological vices, one who can bring lost individuals back to the correct path. In the final freeze frame, the performers latched on to a child following a kite \u2014 the acme of freedom \u2014 which had a cathartic effect, making the audience introspect.",

        "Article Content": "There is something both unnerving and comforting about watching a drama in a near-empty hall. In a world inundated by \u2018content\u2019, it is a reminder of the almost non-existent support that traditional theatrical arts enjoy in the popular imagination. Theatre-goers who chose not to attend Mangolik\u2019s presentation of  missed out on a simple, no-frills story, which would have left them ruminating on their pasts. \u2019s plot is uncomplicated; even children, who form the crux of the play\u2019s emotional spirit, would be able to understand it. An old man, Priyotosh \u2014 played with confidence by the director, Samir Biswas \u2014 runs a shop from his home near a school, selling sundry items for children. His only companion during these advanced years is Sasadhar (Habul Saha), his Man Friday who runs the household. The children seem to fill a void in his life and he appears to find solace in the group of people who frequent his house for  \u2014 parents and grandparents of some students at the school. But secrets come tumbling out of the cupboard when they decide to celebrate Priyotosh\u2019s birthday lavishly, culminating in an emotional climax narrated through a letter penned by Priyotosh.  The strength of   is the naturalistic acting. Each artist is at his or her best. There are no over-the-top expressions, no exaggerated exclamations, distracting from a straightforward story about how children and their innocence should be treasured and adequately nurtured \u2014 a message further driven home by the portrayal of the domestic dynamics in husband-wife relationships. Debabrata Maity\u2019s set design, too, deserves mention as it is detailed enough without needing Bernard Shaw-esque descriptions. What the play lacks perhaps is the onstage presence of the children who are purportedly the cynosure of all eyes. Mangolik would have done well to include in its line-up a few child artists to visit Priyotosh\u2019s shop when school gets over instead of using virtual substitutes   a cacophony of children\u2019s voices playing in the background.",

        "Article Content": "Celebrity chef Ranveer Brar is always happy to come to Calcutta. It\u2019s not just his deep love for the food but also the history, so much so that one would wonder if he has anything else left to explore in the city. \u201cThe Armenian and Jewish side I really haven\u2019t explored. Those layers are definitely something I would like to know,\u201d said Ranveer to  Tell us what\u2019s hot right now in the world of food. I think the hottest thing that\u2019s happening right now in the food world is this whole beautiful dissection and rediscovery of India through its food. The other bit is this whole home chef celebration that\u2019s happening. In India, home cuisine was such a big element of our culinary repertoire you know; it was street food, royal food and then home cooking and unlike anywhere in the world. Maybe Italy and India are two countries, maybe Greece also, their home food is never celebrated that much. In India today it is celebrated through home cooks. You\u2019ve worked in kitchens around the world. How have these diverse experiences influenced your culinary approach? I think it is all that you have. As chefs, your currency is your travel, your conversations. The number of recipes that you know doesn\u2019t really matter. The place where you\u2019re coming from and you\u2019re cooking in, is your real currency. And because you get to travel, because you get to be around food people, it just helps. Which countries have influenced you the most on a vacation? Countries that always teach you something\u2026 Turkey, I think. You know, so I travelled to Konya for Rumi\u2019s tomb. There is Seljuk cuisine which is pre-Ottoman food, which is again beautiful and simple. But even in Ottoman food, the home cooking, the tandoor and the way they treat it is very, very different. Turkey is one country where I\u2019ve always come back from with inspiration. Nordic countries you know, the Lapland of Finland, Lappish Sweden\u2026 those parts where they really almost have nothing and are able to create so many layers of flavour and texture that there\u2019s so much learning to always sort of go back there. In the newer world I\u2019d say Peru, Chile\u2026. What from Indian cuisine would you like to take to a foreign country? I think the easiest way to help people connect with a country can be perhaps a cooking technique. I would take the tandoor you know. You just give me a tandoor, I can open a small restaurant just with one tandoor. What was the most challenging dish you\u2019ve ever created, and what made it so special? I think for me the magic of biryani will always be special as a dish. So, you know, for the longest, I cooked in the gurdwara. Daal  ,  . So I was used to interacting with food and cooking. Biryani, you don\u2019t interact. You\u2019re done, close the lid and come later. Right? So that I think is the magic of biryani, when you open that lid, you\u2019re not in control. And the real cooking happens when you\u2019re not looking. Biryani instills a much deeper confidence and builds a much deeper relationship to your ingredient. So for me, like I said, I first cooked my proper biryani when I was 20. How do you balance tradition and innovation in your cooking? I don\u2019t ya! I try and keep it simple. The only innovation I probably add is, sometimes in presentation, sometimes in pairing so you know I would probably pair a Malabar Parotta with something that you would not normally pair it with. You mentioned in the session that you cook according to your mood. What would you cook when you are happy, nervous, excited and grateful? So when I am happy, I\u2019d be cooking a risotto, which is meditative, you know. When I am angry... hmmm   when I\u2019m cooking, I\u2019ll never, I mean you automatically get centred when you\u2019re cooking. When I am grateful it is always kheer for me. It\u2019s always kheer or some  or whatever. If I am excited, it would be some kebab or something, like a  . Is there a dish or cuisine you haven\u2019t mastered yet but would like to? Plenty of cuisines\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve even mastered one. So, I think we are all cooking, especially Indian food. You know, every village has a story. Every village has a cuisine in itself. It\u2019s very difficult to master all that. So I\u2019m not a master of any cuisine, I\u2019m a servant of food. In India any particular cuisine you want to explore more? I\u2019d want to learn a lot more of North-eastern food. So many years of experience... is there anything you haven\u2019t achieved yet? I have not achieved anything yet. See, it\u2019s a very simple formula. I am living into the future through the present. I\u2019m not chasing anything. I\u2019ve never chased anything. I did not chase these roles. I did not chase these awards. I have been living into the future through the present. So, that is all I\u2019m doing. So I can\u2019t really tell you five years from now what\u2019s going to happen in my life. I can only say that I\u2019ll try and honestly live through the moment that I face, that\u2019s all I can say. I\u2019m almost 50 yaar! Thanks to good hair colour and good skincare regimen.... Do you follow any regimen? You don\u2019t look 50! Of course! I make sure that there\u2019s enough I eat for the skin. I\u2019m telling you all these cosmetics... basically chefs should run the cosmetic industry. I go and I look at this shampoo with avocado, one shampoo with coconut, one shampoo with papaya, one face mask with pineapple... I\u2019m like chefs should be running the cosmetic industry man, all you\u2019re doing is using our ingredients. That\u2019s what our grandmothers used to do, they used to take a papaya and give you and say face pe laga lo. Now all these are coming in a box. Your Reels about food are so informative. Especially on Bengal... you do not just talk about misthi doi, biryani or rosogolla... from telebhaja to Calcutta\u2019s cabin culture, your Reels are on point. How have you learnt so much about Bengali cuisine? Conversations, no? Conversations. Sitting over a coffee, conversing. Kabhi, you know, Nakur (Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy) ka dukan mein baith jaata hoon. Uske dukaan pe jaake baith gaye, aadha ghanta baat kar li. Kahan se aaya chhena, kya hai, kaise hai, kisne banaya. Conversations... khane ki koi kitab nahi hai, khanai kitab hai. So all my knowledge that you see is purely conversation, keenness to know and conversation. From food, let\u2019s talk about films \u2014 after Modern Love Mumbai, you will be seen again on the silver screen in the upcoming Kareena Kapoor Khan-starrer The Buckingham Murders\u2026 tell us about the experience. It\u2019s a very grey sort of a character. Very not-me sort of a character. It was the right sort of uncomfortable. I have my insecurities. But it just felt that this borderline is uncomfortable. Punjabi mein ek word hai chaka kholiya\u2026 when you are a 48-year-old guy, the biggest insecurity is you don\u2019t want to change yourself too much. But then you realise any character, positive or negative, makes you better! It leaves a little bit but for good so that confidence sort of allowed me to say chalo karte hain! You know, I\u2019ve been getting negative roles for the last eight years, three south films, all villains. I refused all those roles. This was a negative role that I said yes to because I said after Modern Love Mumbai, I felt it was a good leap and the right sort of uncomfortable to navigate. So how are you enjoying your journey as an actor? I can\u2019t complain. We know Calcutta holds a very special place in your heart, what\u2019s your message? Kolkata, ami amar monta tomar ranna ghor e rekhe jacchi! That\u2019s what I tell Calcutta every time I leave.",

To heighten awareness about the bill, the government has rolled out blue-and-white \u2018Aparajita\u2019 badges that outraged citizens can attach around their Facebook and WhatsApp DPs. Meanwhile, as preparation for Durga Puja queues, thousands across Kolkata line up to form human chains along prominent roads in the city, gradually realising that standing in front of slowly moving traffic is better than sitting in front of laptops. In some places, protesters leave despondent after quietly accepting that the chains looked far more photogenic in their heads. Elsewhere, select Bengali intellectuals, whose favourite toys (in bed) are hammers and sickles, get excited for the first time in years at the sight of youngsters in rallies carrying copies of  .

        "Article Content": "Appearances, like memory, can be deceptive. At first glance, it would have been easy to mistake  , Ali Akbar P.N.\u2019s recent solo show at Emami Art, as an exhibition of archival photographs. In fact, the artist deliberately blurs the lines among diverse media such as acrylic paintings, photographs and even sculptures and models to examine a theme from various perspectives. To say that Akbar\u2019s acrylic works often mimic old, slightly damaged, archival photographs is not to say that he opts for the sensationalism of hyperrealistic paintings which have become vogue on social media. Instead, by using actual photographs as the source material for some of his works, the artist plays with the malleability of memory \u2014 both collective and individual. Attritions and additions to memory with time are carefully recorded. The clever use of various tones of grey, the slightly scratched surfaces of the paintings, and the ever-so-slightly smudged shapes make it difficult to pin down the subjects of his works \u2014 each viewer will thus perceive Akbar\u2019s memoryscapes differently. Besides the inconsistency of memories and myths, his focus is on the coastal village in Kerala where he grew up, close to the famous ancient port city of Muziris. Like in J.M. Synge\u2019s  , the sea is all-pervasive in his works and its presence is as ominous as it is crucial to the survival of the coastal population whose lives and livelihood depend on it. The interplay of cultures that shapes lives in any port city is also a cornerstone of these works. Ujjal Dey, whose solo show,  , was displayed alongside that of Ali Akbar P.N. explored a different kind of memory in his works \u2014 the oft-overlooked muscle memory that fuels the untiring and unceasing labour of women. His works comprised repeated patterns on soft scrolls of fabric that were reminiscent of the much-mythologised comfort of \u2018 \u2019 \u2014 how is it that no one ever speaks of the hours of labour that break the resistance of the fabrics worn by mothers to give them their signature smoothness? The shapes of the patterns on these scrolls would be familiar to those who have paid attention to everyday domestic rituals \u2014 a   here, an   there. Although the pieces were purely abstract, their essence could not have been clearer or more intimate. What is even more interesting is that Dey uses natural dyes and inks that are extracted using the very same methods that women practise over and over \u2014 cooking, grinding, washing and so on. It was a poignant suite of works that ended with a pantry of the tools and ingredients \u2014 from turmeric to   moulds and jaggery to   \u2014 used by Dey to birth his unique vision of \u2018feminine\u2019 labour.

        "Article Content": "A major reason for unemployment in any economy is that some of its members prefer goods produced outside the economy to those produced within it by other members. This is what had caused unemployment and deindustrialisation under the colonial regime: imported, machine-made British cloth had been preferred to home-produced cloth not just by the landlords but by the peasants as well, which had reduced the demand for the latter and created mass unemployment among the weavers. Now too, imported Chinese lights, for instance, are preferred by many to home-produced candles and lamps even on  day; instances like this constitute one reason for the unemployment and crisis afflicting the domestic petty production sector. The reason for such import-preference lies in the price- or quality-superiority of the imported good over the home-produced one, which, therefore, gives rise to a serious policy dilemma: should a country protect domestic production and employment against imports when such protection causes a reduction in the standard of living of a section of the population that benefits from the price- or quality-superiority of the imported goods? This is an issue on which two of the tallest figures of modern India, Rabindranath Tagore and M.K. Gandhi, had differed. (Incidentally, for any student of the Indian economy, the correspondence between these two, including pieces where they do not directly address one another, that have been conveniently brought together by Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, provides in my view the best reading even to this day). Gandhi was concerned with unemployment. He was, of course, not talking about  against imports; and the colonial State in his time could hardly have been expected to protect domestic employment against imports. But he wanted people to boycott foreign goods so that domestic producers did not lose their employment. To paraphrase him: \u201chow can I deck myself up in the finery of Savile Row when I know that my doing so starves my brother the weaver in the next village?\u201d His appeal was on ethical grounds, that the beneficiaries of imported goods should make a sacrifice for the sake of their local artisan brothers. Tagore\u2019s position, which had also informed his novel,  , was the opposite of this. If the peasantry, constituting the backbone of Bengal\u2019s rural life and acutely oppressed by colonial exactions, managed to access better quality or cheaper cloth, then that should be a source of some relief; snatching away even that relief could not possibly be justified. (He was also acutely aware of the potential for communal conflict that such snatching away could generate since the peasants belonged largely to the minority community while the political movement against foreign goods was led by an elite belonging to the majority community; but I shall not go into this aspect here.) There was in his view no pressing ethical argument for boycotting imported cloth; ethics, if anything pointed in the opposite direction, of supporting the import of cloth for an improvement in the standard of living of the hard-pressed peasantry of Bengal. Modern-day economists would leave the matter there, without sticking their necks out by supporting one or the other position. It is for \u2018society\u2019, they would argue, to make up its mind about whether to privilege the employment objective over cheap imports, or how exactly to strike a balance between the two. While they may have their own personal preferences between the two objectives, as  they would claim they cannot say anything further on the subject, especially since both peasants and artisans are poor and no judgment on  considerations can be made in favour of either. Even analytically, however, leaving the matter there is unwarranted; something much further  be said on the subject when we take a slightly longer view. Colonial deindustrialisation, for instance, while appearing to constitute  a price to be paid for cheaper imports that improved the living standards of the peasantry, entailed   a worsening of the living standard of the agricultural population. It increased the pressure of population on the available land, since the unemployment generated by it forced masses of displaced petty producers into seeking a livelihood in agriculture. As the investment for increasing either the gross cropped area or the yield per acre was not forthcoming from the colonial government, displaced petty producers turning to agriculture meant an increase in land-rents and a decrease in agricultural wages during the nineteenth century that hurt the agricultural population, the very population that is supposed to have benefitted from cheaper cloth imports. (This income effect is noted in Bipan Chandra\u2019s \u201cA Reinterpretation of Nineteenth Century Indian Economic History\u201d,  , 5(1), 1968). The main beneficiaries of the cheaper cloth imports in the nineteenth century, taking both the immediate price effects and  , would have been the landlords and not the peasants who appeared immediately to have been the beneficiaries as well. It follows that the employment objective had to be socially prioritised on egalitarian grounds which most people would accept as ethically legitimate. Two conclusions follow from this: first, analysis has to be pushed much further than appears warranted at first sight, since the full effects of any course of action take much longer to unfold; and second, the effects of unemployment are far more damaging than appear immediately, and hence its removal must claim social priority. In fact, the essence of economic development must consist not in achieving a higher growth of the gross domestic product  , but in overcoming unemployment (and underemployment) even at the expense of cheaper imports if necessary.",

        "Article Content": "In May, the NEET-UG examination for undergraduate medical admissions faced multiple allegations of discrepancies and fraud. NET, an exam that decides whether an individual can teach college students, was cancelled on similar grounds. This is a deeply worrying trend for Indian higher education and society. However, behind these examination scams lies something more pernicious: the seductive allure of merit. Why has meritocracy become so central to our lives? Economic anxieties and wealth inequality are plausible explanations. In an unequal world, people are anxious to \u2018make it big\u2019 to secure a larger share of the social dividend. But there is more to merit than this \u2018economic\u2019 explanation: people want to be seen as self-made. CEOs thus often emphasise their \u2018middle-class\u2019 background and frugal lifestyle even when they are born into wealth and privilege. This helps them preach that anyone can succeed if they try. But is the success of an individual entirely his/her own doing? Are not factors like class, caste, and race relevant? Privileged individuals have more resources, opportunities, and networks that give them a head-start. Moreover, merit is deeply entwined with \u2018cultural capital\u2019 that creates a sense of belonging among individuals coming from similar backgrounds. This leads to an unconscious bias that significantly impacts many decisions, palpably manifest in job interviews. Merit, therefore, should be understood in this subjective framework. The acknowledgement of shared cultural capital influencing our perceptions of what qualifies as meritorious is necessary. The subjectivity of merit is evident in its historical evolution. The idea of merit has been shaped by the values and the biases of each era. Ancient societies valued physical strength and military prowess, while the Renaissance emphasised intellectual achievements. The industrial age prioritised technical skills and innovation and, today, merit includes educational qualifications, professional experience, emotional intelligence, and cultural awareness. Institutional mechanisms for assessing merit, such as standardised tests and interviews, are also contingent upon the idea of merit of the time. As society evolves, so does the concept of merit. This brings us to another intriguing question: is a theoretically perfect meritocracy desirable? In    , Michael Sandel provides a startling inversion of what is \u2018common sense\u2019: does one\u2019s possession of the capacity to provide the services that the market demands legitimise his/her claim to an increased share of the social dividend? For instance, a highly-skilled cricketer born in a country that doesn\u2019t value cricket is likely to be pauperised and compelled to do tasks considered \u2018menial\u2019 to earn a livelihood. In a society where this meritocratic hubris prevails, the arbitrariness of talent and its relation with what the economy demands is glossed over. A person could be considered \u2018meritorious\u2019 in one society and lacking merit in another with the same skills. It is due to this arbitrariness that Friedrich Hayek and John Rawls reject the idea that economic rewards should reflect what people \u2018deserve\u2019. This is a provocative proposition, for it means challenging the values that are embedded in \"untutored public opinion\", which holds that justice implies giving people what they truly deserve. Meritocracy has led to cut-throat competition among students as though they are corporate conglomerates, eager to eliminate their rivals. The corruption in education is directly linked with this meritocratic culture. Additionally, the notion that one\u2019s success is one\u2019s own doing has led the successful to look down upon those who could not succeed. This fuels resentment amongst the \u2018unsuccessful lot\u2019 which finds expression in \u2018populism\u2019. The sense of dispossession among the \u2018unsuccessful\u2019 is exploited by far-Right movements promising to restore a lost sense of identity.",

        "Article Content": "Sir \u2014 There are arguments both for and against veganism. But surely the trend of pet parents forcing their carnivorous pets to eat vegan food is not conscionable. This does not fulfil their nutritional requirements, leading to poor health and, in some cases, even an early death. While every individual has the right to make dietary choices for himself or herself based on moral or other considerations, one must not force these choices down the gullets of those who cannot object, such as a pet cat or a dog. The health of pets must be of foremost importance to humans who have opted to take care of them. In an attempt to alleviate cruelty towards certain animals, we must be careful not to unwittingly subject other animals to cruelty by depriving them of their natural diet. Sir \u2014 The Indian contingent at the Paris Paralympics has performed with great zeal (\u201cBigger haul, better results show India\u2019s medal mettle\u201d, Sept 9). India managed to clinch 29 medals, including seven gold, nine silver and 13 bronze. India has successfully surpassed its performance at Tokyo Paralympics. Some noteworthy performers were Avani Lekhara, Yogesh Kathuniya, Nishad Kumar and Sumit Antil. India is lucky to have such talented athletes. Sir \u2014 India\u2019s para-athletes have made the nation proud. These athletes have been able to transform adversity into strength. Behind every medal won there are countless hours of practise, numerous setbacks, and a tireless pursuit of excellence. Their success is a beacon of hope for thousands. Perseverance, dedication and talent can overcome the greatest of challenges. Sir \u2014 India\u2019s differently-abled athletes have bagged more medals than their counterparts did at the Paris Olympics earlier. The government should make efforts to promote sports for athletes with special needs. This would not only boost their morale but also give their life a purpose. The impressive showing of India\u2019s para-athletes speaks of their indomitable spirit. Acknowledging their talent will inspire them to continue to train harder. Sir \u2014 It is unfortunate that in spite of the International Court of Justice ruling that it is plausible that Israel is carrying out a genocide in Gaza, India has granted licenses for the export of arms and munitions to Tel Aviv (\u201cPlea to stop arms supply to Israel\u201d, Sept 5). India has some legal obligations under the Genocide Convention of the United Nations to which it is a party. It thus should not export weapons to Israel when there is a serious risk that these might be used to commit war crimes. The companies involved in these exports include public sector enterprises under the Union ministry of defence as well as private companies. A petition against such exports has been made to the Supreme Court. Besides violating the Genocide Convention, an export of arms goes against India\u2019s policy of non-alignment. It also belies the statement of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, that India is on the side of peace. Sir \u2014 The indifference of the world towards Rohingyas is shameful (\u201cThousands of Rohingya flee to Bangladesh\u201d, Sept 5). One fails to understand why the United Nations has not been able to prevail on Myanmar to stop its atrocities on the Rohingyas. The Indian government cannot remain a silent spectator to such ethnic cleansing in its neighbourhood. It must exercise its influence in the corridors of power to rein in Myanmar. The global diplomatic community has a moral responsibility to stop the systemic and systematic oppression of Rohingyas in Myanmar. Sir \u2014 Besides flash floods, landslides and cloudbursts, shooting stones are yet another natural hazard that will be intensified with climate change-induced rainfall. Shooting stones are basically huge rocks or boulders that roll down mountain slopes crushing everything in their paths. Besides causing traffic disruptions, they also pose a threat to life and property. Continuous rains, landslides and sudden tremors can cause shooting stones. It is high time that the authorities take steps to prevent such accidents. Stabilising the slopes and taking steps to prevent soil erosion can reduce the threat posed by shooting stones. The installation of early warning systems would also help alert the authorities and the public about potential threats. Sir \u2014 While presenting the Union budget this year, the finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, announced a slew of initiatives aimed at skilling the youth and creating jobs. Such schemes, with an outlay of rupees two lakh crore for a five-year period, are also an acknowledgement of the crisis of unemployment in the country. Unemployment in India is not simply owing to a lack of opportunities but also because many people lack the right skills. Sir \u2014 It is a relief that Anant Ambani\u2019s Vantara Foundation has reached out to the Namibian government to extend a helping hand in the face of the severe drought in that country which is threatening the wildlife there. Namibia has sanction\u00aded the culling of over 700 animals because of the food shortage caused by the drought. The Vantara Foundation\u2019s offer of help is thus a godsend. One hopes Namibia accepts this help and decides against killing animals.",

        "Article Content": "A recent letter from activists and legal experts to the chief minister merits scrutiny. This is because the missive raises several legal red flags about the Aparajita Woman and Child (West Bengal Criminal Laws Amendment) Bill, 2024 that has been passed by Mamata Banerjee\u2019s government. While prescribing harsher punishments for rape, the bill, in a particular case \u2014 that of rape and injury leading to the death of the victim or the victim being reduced to a vegetative state \u2014 has recommended death as the sole penalty. This, those knowledgeable in law agree, is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court had pointed out in one of its earlier judgments that the death penalty can in no way be made mandatory; even the Justice Verma Committee, which was constituted to examine laws and criminal justice practices concerning sexual violence, was opposed to the death penalty as a deterrent. Data around the globe bear out this sound legal position. There are other concerns that plague the bill. The push towards setting up a special task force as well as dedicated courts of inquiry will not bear fruit unless these agencies and institutions are given the funds, infrastructure and personnel that would make them effective. Will such resources be made available? The bill does not mention offences against sexual minorities: the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, too, maintains a dispiriting silence on this subject. The drafting of the bill, the critics have stated, could have been far more representative: the traditional practice of holding consultations with a diverse set of stakeholders, including members of the civil society, was not adhered to. Taken together, these limitations confirm that the drafting of the bill was a knee-jerk response on the part of the powers that be when they were confronted with serious public pressure to address the crisis. Justice delayed is undesirable; similarly, extreme haste in the dispensing of justice can often lead to the adoption of problematic \u2014 populist \u2014 positions that end up treating the symptoms rather than the disease. Sexual violence against women is the result of embedded structural pathologies. Confronting these impediments requires sustained, deeper engagements \u2014 well-thought-out preventive measures, reforms in policing, improvements in conviction rates, sensitising intimate spaces and people are among the necessary measures. Meaningful transformations will remain elusive as long as legislations prioritise the punitive over the reformatory.",

        "Article Content": "A sedentary lifestyle is a feature of modern living. So it is not surprising that a national survey \u2014 the first of its kind \u2014 has found that over 20 crore Indians are physically inactive. The study conducted jointly by Dalberg Advisors and Sports and Society Accelerator, a think tank and a non-profit organisation, respectively, revealed other problematic trends as well: 48% of older adults believe that they are too old to engage in physical activity like playing while 45% are of the opinion that the pursuit of sports is not safe for girls. Several misconceptions discourage women from participating in physical activities. Physical exertion is considered detrimental to menstruating women; bodily injuries suffered in the course of exercising may dent their marriage prospects, or so goes the regressive line of thinking. Such misconceptions are responsible for the wide gender gap in physical engagements: the study found abstention from physical activity is most acute among urban citizens, especially women. This is unsurprising given that 75% of Indian women\u2019s active time is spent in doing a myriad household chores, leaving them with little time for exercise. The lack of open spaces, such as parks and fields, in urban settings is another factor that can be attributed to the sedentary lives of men and women. Little wonder then that the level of physical inactivity in cities, the study found, was twice that of the rural areas. Global data are consistent with these revelations. A recent   study stated that about one-third of the human population did not meet the World Health Organization\u2019s recommended levels of activity: India ranked 12th among 195 countries with the highest prevalence of physical inactivity. Socio-cultural factors can also serve as impediments to a healthy lifestyle. One in five Indian parents, for instance, believes that children will not achieve good grades if they indulge in sports. The deleterious consequences of immobility are well known. A physically inactive population is more vulnerable to serious physiological as well as mental health afflictions. Fitness also has an economic incentive. A physically active population can boost India\u2019s GDP by over Rs 15 trillion annually by 2047. The government must come up with policy interventions to encourage citizens to become active. The provision of open spaces and public \u2014 subsidised \u2014 gymnasiums for adults and a sport-friendly curriculum for children can be looked into. An annual   day is hardly enough to whip Indian couch potatoes into shape.",

        "Article Content": "Yogendra Yadav\u2019s two recent articles in  have initiated an interesting public discussion on the relevance and the future trajectory of what may be called Indian political theory. Yadav highlights a set of issues \u2014 an \u201c\u2026 emaciation of our political vision, the shrinkage in the vocabulary of politics, the withering away of our political understanding, the poverty of political judgement and the recession in the agenda for political action\u201d \u2014 to conclude that \u201c[t]he river of ideas\u2026 has suddenly dried up.\u201d This critical assessment of contemporary political thinking has led to a highly sophisticated and nuanced debate. A section of scholars, especially political scientists, argues that academic analysis of Indian politics \u2014 critical mapping of political phenomena in their entirety, their logical explanations and appraisal, and the exploration of the avenues where new forms of politics get shaped and nurtured \u2014 cannot be underestimated. Indian political theory, it is claimed, is a rich subfield of political science, which is flourishing in a variety of ways. Yadav acknowledges this line of argument in his rejoinder. He also admits the political value of scholarly interventions. However, Yadav further clarifies the fact that his primary purpose is to investigate the reasons that led to the decline of imaginative political thinking in India over the years. More precisely, he emphasises the need to have a \u201ccollective deliberation on why we reached this place, and what can be done to reinvigorate this lifeline of our republic.\u201d This is an important question. While it is true that contemporary Indian politics is being studied and analysed as a serious object of academic research, the relationship between political   and political   (at least in the narrower sense of the term) is almost insubstantial. Political parties do not engage with the intellectual class. There are intellectual wings in most national parties which often function in collaboration with affiliated organisations, especially in universities. However, these bodies do not function as independent think tanks; instead, these intellectual wings are used to capture academic institutions for establishing political dominance. The party intellectuals thus behave like official spokespersons simply to disseminate the message of the top leadership.  That is one of the reasons why professional academics do not want to be associated with such intellectual wings. It is important to remember that our democracy has become highly election-centric. Political parties envisage elections as the main arena of competitive politics. The big ideas, such as social transformation, imagination of an egalitarian society, establishment of a just economic system, are, consequentially, reduced to proposed policy initiatives. The election process has been transformed into a political marketplace to address voters as consumers. This framework forces the political elite to look out for ready-to-use, bullet-point responses, which might be used for making electoral packages more appealing and effectual. This, in turn, reduces the possibility of a long term and sustainable political engagement with the intellectual class. At the same time, it provides the political class the confidence to rely on a business-like imagination of actual politics. The success of the idea of   in election is a good example in this regard. There are, however, a set of scholars who try to bridge the gap between intellectual work and political life of the country. A long list of intellectuals \u2014 Ashutosh Varshney, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, Suhas Palshikar, Sandeep Shastri, Suraj Yengde, Harish Wankhede, Christophe Jaffrelot, Ramachandra Guha, Sanjay Kumar, Mukul Kesavan, Abhay Dubey, Ashok Pandey, Peter R. deSouza, Zoya Hasan, Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, Nivedita Menon, Nandini Sundar, Rama Lakshmi, Asim Ali, Yogendra Yadav and many others \u2014 contributes significantly to shape the nature of public debates in India. Yogendra Yadav\u2019s intervention, in this sense, is more relevant. It recognises the separation between professional academic research and the actual business of politics; yet, at the same time, he calls upon the observers, analysts, and practitioners of politics to collectively think and produce futuristic imaginations of politics in the Indian context.  There are two important issues, which require serious attention to understand Yadav\u2019s rather provocative observation about the decline of political thinking. First, there is an invitation to discover a   of comprehensive social change. Yadav\u2019s recent writings underline a crucial distinction between   (which sticks to a particular identity as the ultimate vantage point for political action) and   (a profound, multilayered, nuanced form of politics, which gives due recognition to uncomfortable facts and internal contradictions). The public debate on Muslim identity is a good example to elucidate this distinction.  politics relies heavily on a homogeneous and undifferentiated Muslim identity to sustain the Hindu-Muslim divide. This has helped it project every aspect of Muslim social life as a problematic phenomenon. The opponents of   have questioned this obvious demonisation of Muslims. They evoke secular, democratic values of the Constitution to refute all kinds of communalism. No one can deny the significance of this egalitarian-democratic form of politics. However, the problem arises when the internal contradictions among Muslims \u2014 caste-based exclusion of Dalit and Pasmanda Muslims and the marginalisation of Muslim women \u2014 are projected as unimportant, troublesome and  -sponsored issues. From Yadav\u2019s point of view, this strategic silence on internal contradictions may be described as the shallow politics of identity, which would eventually contribute to a totalising framework promoted by the   groups in the name of nationalism. This brings us to the second facet of Yadav\u2019s argument. He claims that the national movement was an intellectual resource, which played a significant role in the making of the Constitution. Postcolonial Indian politics, especially in the early decades after Independence, inherited the values and ideals of the national movement. The Constitution, in this sense, is not merely a legal document; it is a political manifesto, which encourages us to get involved in the egalitarian politics of human emancipation and socio-economic equality. In other words, the Constitution is a legitimate resource for us to produce new and more radical imaginations of social change. This proposal, in my view, goes beyond the two given narratives of our times \u2014 the Constitution is a sacred book, which must always be obeyed as a legal directive and the Constitution is under threat and, hence, it must be protected. Yadav\u2019s thesis wants us to have a new kind of political vision, which might help us produce new ideas of India. The present debate, it seems, is certainly contributing in this direction. ",

        "Article Content": "Seasons change: but what remains unchanged is the spectre of violence in strife-torn Manipur. A former armyman belonging to the Kuki-Zo community was lynched in Imphal West on Sunday night after he had inadvertently crossed over into an area that has a sizeable presence of Meiteis. Manipur has also witnessed a spike in violence in some other areas with \u2014 this is worrying \u2014 Kuki insurgents using sophisticated weaponry such as drones and rockets in the course of their targeted assaults. The rupture of the tenuous, uneasy peace has, understandably, led to the renewal of public demonstrations. Thousands of students have taken to the streets protesting against the latest round of violence and demanding, among other things, for the reins of the Unified Command to be handed over to state authorities. Tellingly, the chief minister, N. Biren Singh, too, made a similar submission to the governor recently. His other demand was the revocation of the suspension of operation agreement that is in place with militant organisations. Both of Mr Singh\u2019s demands are audacious. Given the extent of the ethnic polarisation in Manipur \u2014 State institutions are no longer immune from this vice \u2014 the granting of the reins of the Unified Command, a crucial coordinating agency between New Delhi and Manipur, to Imphal could heighten the possibility of prejudicial, retaliatory violence. Mr Singh\u2019s belligerence, even though he has failed to douse the flames for over a year, must not be pandered to by the Centre. But is the Centre keen on resolving the situation at the earliest? The prime minister\u2019s seeming indifference towards the crisis does not instil much confidence. Peace cannot return to Manipur through a dis\u00adproportionate emphasis on a securitised approach. What is needed is a consensual political resolution. But this cannot happen without involving the state\u2019s, albeit frayed, civil society. A simultaneous political and civil initiative to bridge the trust deficit between the warring communities along with the rehabilitation of the affected people   partisanship could be considered  as the inaugural steps towards normalcy. Parallelly, the security forces must also neutralise any attempt on the part of mischievous elements to reignite the flames. The biggest impediment to the return of peace in Manipur remains the pursuit of narrow, divisive motives. This kind of regressive agenda must be shunned immediately for the sake of peace.",

        "Article Content": "Sir \u2014 Entomophagy has been an accepted practice in many cultures across the world and, yet, it was relegated to the category of dietary exotism in modern societies after the agricultural revolution. But it seems that creepy crawlies are now making a comeback on our plates in an effort to combat climate change. Recently, the Singapore Food Agency approved 16 species of insects, including beetles, locusts, grasshoppers and mealworms, as fit for human consumption on the grounds that insects are healthier, less expensive, and more environmentally sustainable than meat. However, given the deeply entrenched biases against consuming insects, will the prospect of saving the planet be enough to get people to switch to a bug-based diet? Sir \u2014 The ongoing mass agitation against the rape and murder of a young woman doctor at R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital is not being organised by any political outfit. But there has been a deliberate attempt to label this spontaneous outpouring of anger as \u2018political\u2019 by members of the Trinamool Congress government. The public outburst is an expression of a lack of confidence in the government. The TMC parliamentarian, Jawhar Sircar, has rightly resigned from the Rajya Sabha citing his concerns over the state government\u2019s mishandling of the protests (\u201cClumsy and corrupt: MP quit missive to CM\u201d, Sept 9). Sircar\u2019s resignation must be seen as dissent against the malaises afflicting the government. Sir \u2014 The concerns raised by Jawhar Sircar against the TMC dispensation in West Bengal are justified. The rape and murder of a young woman doctor at her place  of work has triggered massive outrage and raised questions about the safety of women in their workplaces. What is worse, the clumsy handling of the incident and the hasty reinstatement of the outgoing principal in an equivalent position has led  to suspicions of a cover-up. The nexus of corruption in public hospitals that has come to light thereafter has tarnished the image of the Mamata Banerjee-led government. The dispensation is failing to read the public mood and employing diversionary tactics that keep backfiring. Sir \u2014 Jawhar Sircar, a former Indian Administrative Service officer and one of the staunchest critics of the Narendra Modi regime at the Centre, has left the Rajya Sabha on account of the culture of corruption in the TMC. Sircar has been unsparing in his criticism of the Bengal government\u2019s response to the movement demanding justice for the R.G. Kar victim. He deserves applause for demonstrating courage of conviction, a rarity in today\u2019s politicians. Sir \u2014 Jawhar Sircar has expressed his grievances against the TMC in a letter addressed to Mamata Banerjee. In this letter, Sircar referred to having considered resigning after the arrest of the then state education minister, Partha Chatterjee. He stated that at that time, he chose to stay on in the Rajya Sabha in the hope that Banerjee would continue her anti-corruption efforts. The R.G. Kar incident reveals how deep the roots of corruption go in the TMC. Sir \u2014 With the wrestlers, Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia, joining the Congress, the party\u2019s fortunes in the upcoming assembly elections in Haryana have brightened remarkably (\u201cVinesh joins Cong, in poll bout\u201d, Sept 7). The Congress aims to present itself as a platform for the youth through Phogat and Punia. The party is keen to capitalise on the popularity of the two wrestlers, especially Phogat\u2019s after her historic bout at the Paris Olympics. Given that both wrestlers are from the Jat community, this could also consolidate the decisive Jat vote bank in the state for the Congress. On the other hand, the internal feuds in the Bharatiya Janata Party have led to several senior state leaders quitting after being denied tickets. It seems that all the stacks are in favour of the Grand Old Party to wrest back power in Haryana. Sir \u2014 The Congress had put up a united front with the Aam Aadmi Party in Haryana before the Lok Sabha elections but is aver\u00adse to such an alliance in the state polls. Perhaps the Congress has become con\u00adfident of winning after the induction of Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia. But it would be a mistake to assume that the party can win Haryana by just banking on the popularity of the two wrestlers. The AAP has increased its foothold in the state and may end up clinching crucial seats. This will divide the vote shares of the Congress and the AAP, ultimately helping the BJP. Sir \u2014 A recent study published in   has revealed that around 11 crore household latrines built under the Swachh Bharat Mission have averted 60,000-70,000 infant deaths annually. This reaffirms the link between improved access to sanitation and reduced in child mortality. Launched in 2014, the Swachh Bharat Mission has proved to be a game-changer in improving sanitation in the country. Sir \u2014 Arijit Chatterjee\u2019s article, \u201cPath of shame\u201d (Sept 9), highlighted the worrisome condition of the footpaths in Calcutta and elsewhere. Encroachment on footpaths by hawkers has become common. Chatterjee suggested solutions to the menace such as instituting a separate cadre of footpath police which would save pavements from being encroached on. This must be implemented across India.",

        "Article Content": "It is often remarked by the privileged castes that they do not practise casteism. That caste is something only Dalits practise and propagate by using reservation and State benefits. This kind of behaviour is an instance of reverse casteism where the onus of caste is placed on Dalits while the Brahminical castes are portrayed as casteless. 'Casual casteism' is the mode of practising casteism through the ambivalence of castelessness. It is a term that denotes the everyday use of language and behaviour, which allows dominant castes to indulge in the free-play of caste oppression. The term, casual, is particularly important here \u2014 it allows the free-play of certain kinds of action, language, and usage of words, including behaviours and gestures, without inviting severe implications. That which is casual by nature becomes distanced from the serious and the legal. Casual is denoted by a meaning ascribed to the perception of something that is so familiar, common, and ordinary that it is not seen as an exception. Thus, casual casteism does not invest the citizen with moral and ethical duties or invite penal measures. One of the significant ways to understand casual casteism is to examine the specific ways in which dominant castes operationalise it. Casual casteism occurs in public spaces such as universities, institutions, social circles, and the workplace. Even the most common bonds among students, friends, and associated relations are exposed to the violence of casual casteism. It is displayed by dominant-caste people through narrative and rhetoric while attempting to maintain a superficial air of intent and purpose. Casual casteism is often ambivalent and indistinct. How then does one decide whether a remark or a gesture is casual or casteist? Who has the power of decision in this context? Casual casteism usually involves a dominant-caste person naturally assuming his right to find faults with a Dalit person and construing Dalits to be deviants, unfit for public or private presence. Public spaces often witness such remarks as Dalits are ugly, cannot speak correctly, do not get good marks, are not skilled in extra-curricular activities, are not smart enough to put up cultural performances, are backward, timid, awkward, incompetent and worthless. Casual casteism constructs caste stereotypes that normalise the everyday behaviour of the dominant castes and depict Dalits in poor light. Contemporary Indian campuses witness interactions among students from different castes. Dominant castes project their discomfort in more ways than one, including demeaning gazes, talking to and treating fellow Dalit friends in a manner that allows the unfolding of casual casteism without it being expressly identifiable. Questions such as 'How did you get this job?', narratives like 'There is no difficulty for you to get jobs since you are using quota,' or behaviour such as withholding recognition and withdrawing interaction are instances of everyday casual casteism. Casual casteism also occurs through jokes and slang that are aimed to emphasise the superiority of the dominant castes and the cultural inferiority of Dalits. Casual casteism violates commonality. Here, the perception of the ordinary is used to legitimise the norms of unethical and immoral thought and action. Casual casteism permits the continuity of caste in the garb of benign ordinariness, leaving Dalits \u2014 the targets of casual casteism \u2014 confounded about whether they are the recipients of casual casteism or something else.",

        "Article Content": "The festive season is here and it\u2019s the time of year when Onam, Kerala\u2019s vibrant harvest festival, unites the entire nation, celebrating rich traditions beyond regional borders. And that calls for dressing the part too. When it comes to traditional wear, one homegrown brand that continues to reign with its sustainable and soft ethnic pieces is Suta. Founded and led by sisters Sujata Biswas and Taniya Biswas, Suta\u2019s Onam collection, \u2018Malli Poove\u2019, has been specially designed for  this festive season. To celebrate the spirit of the festival,  spoke with Sujata, who walked us through the thought process behind the collection and shared style pointers too. The first thing that catches your eye when you see the collection is the colour palette. The tones are primarily white and off-white, making them easy on the eyes and appropriate for the weather. The fabrics include mul cotton saris, cotton viscose saris and cotton slub saris. \u201cAt Suta, our Onam collection \u2018Malli Poove\u2019 is a heartfelt celebration of Kerala\u2019s beauty and the festival\u2019s vibrant spirit. Over the past three years, we\u2019ve been curating and expanding this collection, adding new designs each year to capture the evolving essence of the festival,\u201d said Sujata Biswas, co-founder of the homegrown label Suta. In their \u2018Malli Poove\u2019\ncollection, the brand showcases intricate weaves, delicate prints and\ntraditional golden zari work. The label also offers a selection of designer\nblouses in solid monochromes \u2014 some with dainty prints and others in vibrant\nhues with no prints or embroidery. The blouses come in a wide range \u2014 from\nhalter neck to traditional designs. \u201cEach sari tells its own\nstory \u2014 whether inspired by lush landscapes adorned with banana plants or the\nvibrant flowers used in Pookalams. We\u2019ve employed a diverse range of fabrics \u2014\nfrom mulmul to cotton silk and viscose cotton \u2014 ensuring a rich variety in\ntexture and feel,\u201d Sujata added. \nThe brand is also known\nfor its unique naming tradition for outfits. The saris in their Onam collection\nfeature interesting names such as Shilpam, Aruvi, Minnal, Kaanti, Arali,\nSandhya, Apsara and Shoro-o-Sharaarat, among others. In addition to the minimalist cotton\nsaris that exude elegance, there are stunning party-ready\nstatement saris in organza silk with golden floral embroidery on the borders.\nThe collection also includes a handloom cotton sari with embroidery tassel and\na quirky   depicting moods and moments of two sisters \u2014 adding to\nSuta\u2019s innovative series. The\nrange also has   sets. Primarily a white hue series, the co-ord\nsets are easy-breezy, with fine details like lace bottom pants, playing with\nthe design. The   sets have contemporary designs like noodle-strap  to\nethnic designs like Anarkalis. These sets also have artistic names like\nChandhni and Svetah, while the  , which can also be bought as stand-alone pieces,\nhave names like Safed Mann and Sutlej. The Onam collection also\nhas  sets with statement or minimalist  and flowing\nwhite skirts with matching  . A set like Himagiri reminds of  , imagining the beauty of Kerala. For fashionistas who\nprefer a western, non-ethnic look for the festival, the collection offers a\nshort overlay dress with a tie-up wrap and kimono elbow-length sleeves, named\nSnow Bunting Spirals, made from handloom cotton.  \nFor men, the \u2018Malli\nPoove\u2019 collection features a handloom cotton full-sleeve  named\nNakshatram and a full-length  with an intricate floral motif called\nSwords and Lilies. \u201cStyling your \u2018Malli\nPoove\u2019 sari is about embracing tradition while adding your personal flair. For\na classic look, temple gold jewellery pairs perfectly with saris with gold\nzari, while silver jewellery complements saris with silver zari. If your sari\nfeatures both, mixing metallic tones can create a balanced and elegant look.\nFor a modern twist, consider contemporary jewellery in gold or metallic tones \u2014\npieces that are less traditional \u2014 offering a fresh and stylish approach,\u201d said\nSujata, dropping fashion pointers to zhuzh up the Onam lookbooks.  Sujata also favours\njewellery with precious stones to add a pop of colour to the look. Whether the\nstones should contrast with or match the colour of the outfit \u2014 she leaves the choice\nto the fashionista\u2019s discretion. The entrepreneur who\nalso models for her brand suggests having a gold blouse \u2014 a timeless addition\nto the wardrobe \u2014 that can create subtle yet stylish looks. For those who like\ncolour-blocking, contrast blouses in rich shades, when teamed with off-white\nsaris are a huge hit, according to the fashion label owner.  Sharing a few more\nnuggets on completing the lookbooks, Sujata shared, \u201cWhen it comes to\naccessories, select bags and jewellery that echo the metallic elements of your\nsari \u2014 whether gold, silver or a combination. Alternatively, playful\naccessories in contrasting colours can add an extra touch of personality. To\ncomplete your look, go for natural makeup that enhances your beauty without\noverpowering the sari\u2019s delicate details.\u201d \nYou can explore the Onam\ncollection  .",

        "Article Content": "Sohaila Abdulali was gangraped when she was 17. That was 1980. In Bombay, as the city was then known. She survived and chose to talk about it. She told her family, she went to the police and when she turned 20 she wrote about it. A sharp piece in the magazine  , which recounted details like \u201cI think I was raped 10 times\u201d and how the four armed men let her go after a lecture on what an \u201cimmoral whore\u201d she was to have been alone with a boy that moment when they accosted her. Sohaila\u2019s undergraduate thesis was on rape, she worked as a rape crisis counsellor after college in the US, and in 2018, she wrote the book  . She also did other things. She studied economics and sociology, wrote children\u2019s books, raised a family. Life did not stop at rape. These days, Sohaila, 61, is based in New York.  Cut to Calcutta of 2024. On August 9, a junior doctor of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital was raped. She was also murdered, which means she is never going to get a chance to reclaim her life\u2019s story. She is always going to be defined by her rape.  Sohaila tells   over a WhatsApp call: \u201cAfter I was raped, the most important\nthing in my life was how people were responding to me in my own home, my own\ncircle.\u201d Here, now, different sections of society are seeking different things\nin all but the murdered junior doctor\u2019s name. In\n2012, which is the year of the Nirbhaya case, there were 24,923 rapes,\naccording to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Sohaila\u2019s story\nwould have been forgotten but for the media churn following the 2012 Delhi gang\nrape. Suddenly, everyone was talking about rape. \u201cThat in itself was\nunthinkable in 1980s India,\u201d Sohaila says.  A\nsection of the media is calling the Calcutta junior doctor Abhaya. Since\nNirbhaya, right up to 2022, there have been 3,59,735 registered cases of rape,\naccording to NCRB data. Beyond 2022 and right up to Abhaya there is\nno data, but one can work out a ballpark figure. The population of Iceland is\nset to cross 4,00,000 soon; just saying. Sohaila\u2019s\ncase wasn\u2019t even registered as rape. She writes: \u201cNo charges were brought. The police\nrecorded a statement that we had gone for a walk and had been \u2018delayed\u2019 on our\nreturn.\u201d Unlike\nIndia in the 1980s, right now, everyone is talking about the junior doctor\u2019s\nrape. Anger over rape is natural. Talking about rape is important. Sohaila calls\nit \u201cexploding the silence\u201d. In\nthe past three weeks, the conversation has moved from the horror of the crime\nand coverup to a collective call for justice. \u201cWe want justice\u201d and \u201cJustice\nfor RG Kar\u201d are the overarching cries. From her interactions with rape\nvictims, can Sohaila elaborate on the nature of the justice a rape victim\nseeks? \u201cFor some it is the process of conviction, even if the accused are\nacquitted. But then again for some, the court proceedings feel like another\nviolation,\u201d she says.  Sohaila\nhas said many times over that despite the rape she is a happy person. The very\nfact that her case was never registered, has it made her less happy? Sohaila\nreplies: \u201cOf course, it would have been good if my rapists were caught and\npunished. I tried and that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d She continues: \u201cEveryone believed\nme, everyone supported me, everyone loved me and I could have my life. That was\njustice for me.\u201d In\nthe case of the raped and murdered, there is no scope for such considerations.\nSo in the quest for redress, the State thinks Precaution. Immediately after the\nincident, the Bengal government issued detailed guidelines on women\u2019s\nsafety. One of them had to do with minimising night shifts for working women.\nThere is a chapter in Sohaila\u2019s book titled \u201cRape prevention for\nbeginners\u201d. The bulleted points read: \u201cStay\nhome; avoid strangers Go\nout avoid family Look\nfierce Look\nmeek Be\nloud Be\nsoft Smile Don\u2019t\nsmile...\u201d The\nother thing on the State\u2019s list is Prevention. A new bill was passed in the\nAssembly earlier this week, one that prescribes the death penalty for all kinds\nof rape. Sohaila says: \u201cDeath penalty is society\u2019s way of deflecting\nresponsibility\u2026.

        "Article Content": "India might not have featured anywhere near the top in the Paris Olympics medals tally but there was one aspect where the Indian performance was deemed the best. The India House at the Olympic Games was reportedly the most popular haunt among visitors to the Parc de la Villette, which was called Nations Park during the Olympiad. The India House was a temporary hospitality address that provided an immersive experience, celebrating India\u2019s athletes, and drew not just the diaspora and Indian tourists visiting Paris but also Parisians and tourists of other nationalities wanting to get a feel of India\u2019s sporting and cultural legacy. A first-of-its-kind initiative of Reliance Foundation in partnership with the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), India House offered experiences like Indian cuisine, yoga and chance meetings with athletes who dropped by. \u201cThere were 19 countries which had put up such pavilions at the Nations Park. We got featured on the official Olympic broadcaster, France 2. The host, who interviewed me, had been to all the other pavilions and said India House deserved the gold medal,\u201d said a beaming Devendra Kumar Chhajar, a 27-year-old Behala boy who went to France six years ago for his Masters and stayed back. The pavilion was covered from view from outside but with dholaks playing a boisterous beat that was audible from afar, it drew long queues of the curious. \u201cIn the morning, there were a lot of foreigners while desi folks came mostly in the evenings,\u201d he said. Inside, there were Bollywood dance tips, block print from Rajasthan and mehndi application, other than live broadcast of India\u2019s events. Daily tickets cost \u20ac5. \u201cOther pavilions mostly had a bar and music. We had handicraft items on sale as also Bollywood dance and malkhamb performances. One could taste vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. We broke attendance records daily,\u201d Chhajar smiled. Smriti Bhat, a Bangalorean who has done her Masters from Sciences Po, the public university for political studies in Paris, was in the PR team. \u201cI showed people around, explaining activities like weaving of Benarasi saris and carpets on the loom.\u201d A resident since 2013, she has picked up conversational French. A bonus for the youngsters was meeting the players. \u201cI put a tika on (badminton star) Lakshya Sen. I also met (shooting double medalist) Manu Bhaker and (table tennis star) Monica Batra,\u201d Smriti smiles. Devendra saw Bhaker, (paddlers) Batra and Sreeja Akula, (shooter) Sarabjot Singh, (hockey goalie) P.R. Sreejesh, Rahul Dravid and designer Manish Malhotra but missed meeting javelin star Neeraj Chopra. \u201cHe came on my day off,\u201d he lamented. Smriti had to explain the Billion Strong Flame to visitors.  Since India is bidding to host the Games in 2036, there was a QR code which one could scan and add one\u2019s name to the digital petition which would flash on the screen. \u201cWe collected thousands of signatures at the event,\u201d Smriti said. India House was open from 11am to 10.30pm and duties were allocated in two shifts. Smriti stays in the 14th   (borough). \u201cIt took me 35-40 minutes to reach.\u201d For Devendra, it was a longer commute as he stays on the outskirts. He watched the India-Germany semi-final hockey match and athletics on his off days. \u201cThe hype started here two years ago when the Seine started getting cleaned. I bought the tickets then.\u201d Anjali Joshi, a 25-year-old Goan, who had opted for a sports programme as part of her business school course in France, applied to an agency that was the hospitality partner at the Games. \u201cTheir job was to facilitate VIP movement. Once I was selected, I was given a choice of role. I did not fancy being a parking attendant in peak summer. So I chose box office coordinator,\u201d she said. Anjali was assigned to a cabin at the entrance of the venues \u2014 the Velodrome, hosting the cycling events, or the Chateau de Versailles, the home of pentathlon and equestrian sports. \u201cI had an all-access card but could not enter the stadium and take a seat. Versailles is so big that it takes 20 minutes to reach the other end. The cross-country horse riding was taking place in a garden. So I could see the action in passing. It was my first event and I was thrilled!\u201d she said. Her biggest spot was Novak Djokovic. \u201cThe day after he won his tennis gold, he came to Versailles with his family. His daughter was wearing his medal. We were not allowed to click. He walked right past me. It was surreal!\u201d French football superstar Antoine Griezmann might not have been in the Olympic team but he attended an event. \u201cMy colleagues were screaming and jumping. I saw only half his face and a bit of his hair.\u201d Back home, Anjali\u2019s folks were so excited that they opened a WhatsApp group called \u2018Anjali at Olympics\u2019. \u201cI was asked to post not just my own pictures but also whatever my friends would send from other venues.\u201d Versailles being 20km away from Paris, she could not visit anywhere else. \u201cThere was no Metro on that route and the only train was low frequency. For early morning shifts, we got Uber coupons. Otherwise, it took me an hour and a half to reach,\u201d Anjali said. She loved watching the dressage event. \u201cIt\u2019s an obedience test. They make the horse move to the music. Though we could not leave the booth, we could follow the horses on the giant screens.\u201d Riya Chakraborty, a 24-year-old from Pune, works in a sports management agency in Paris and was assigned to a bank that was a premium partner at the Games. This meant she had to work with the athletes supported by the bank, creating content on their Olympic journey for the bank\u2019s sites. \u201cThere were over 250 athletes that the bank supports, mostly French. I had to read up on them. About seven or eight stars were expected to win. But it was more interesting to track those who performed beyond expectation,\u201d says Riya, who has made Paris her home for four years now. An event space was created in front of the Grand Palais, the venue for fencing and taekwondo. \u201cIt was accessible only to customers and athletes.\u201d Riya would accompany the athlete\u2019s family in the stands when she was creating content on his or her background. \u201cI saw a judo match at Champs de Mars (near the Eiffel Tower) where the athlete got a bronze.\u201d She also watched rock climbing at Le Bourget. The bank also supported two basketball players. \u201cThey brought the entire French team with them and signed on our wall of fame.\u201d Riya\u2019s most memorable experience is interviewing the gold and silver medallists in women\u2019s fencing, both French. \u201cI asked Sara Balzer, the silver medalist, how she felt competing against a compatriot in the final. She said she had no regrets as she knew whoever won, France would get the medal. That message stayed with me.\u201d She is also full of admiration for a gold medallist surfer. Since the Mediterranean Sea in southern France is calm and the Atlantic waves in Bordeaux are not fit for competition, the surfing events took place in Tahiti, in French Polynesia, 16,000km away from Paris. Kauli Vaast, the winner, was jetlagged as he had to take a flight shortly after his event to reach Paris. \u201cYet he took the stage, answered all our questions and posed for pictures. He said he had not slept well in 15 days. It was a lesson in professionalism.\u201d She also got to interact with triathletes and, from their feedback, made light of the debate over the water quality of the Seine. \u201cA French triathlete, Leo Bergere, told me that they are used to swimming in the dirtiest of waters to build immunity. He had been practising in the river long before the Games started, to get used to the current. He said he couldn\u2019t see his hands sometimes, the water was so dirty. Yet he did not mind,\u201d she said of the Olympic bronze winner. The end of the Olympics has created a void in their lives. \u201cI miss the Olympics. It\u2019s the best international experience I could have asked for, to be surrounded by the world\u2019s best athletes, competing at the highest level, doing what they love. It was truly a dream to be a part of it,\u201d Anjali signed off.",

        "Article Content": "Earlier this month, the results of Germany's provincial elections sent shockwaves across Europe after the far-Right Alternative for Democracy won the vote in the eastern state of Thuringia and came a close second in the state of Saxony. It is the first time since the Second World War that a far-Right party has won a state election in Germany. Days later, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, appointed the veteran conservative politician, Michel Barnier, as the country\u2019s prime minister in an apparent bid to appease the far-Right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen with whose support Mr Macron hopes to run the government. This, even though Ms Le Pen's coalition came third in the snap polls in June and July. Mr Macron had earlier rejected the prime ministerial nominee of the Left coalition that secured the most seats in the election, arguing that all other groupings would together bring a Left government down in a vote of no confidence. Both of these developments, in Europe's two largest economies, point to the expanding influence of the far-Right among the continent's voters as well as the growing mainstream legitimacy it enjoys within the political system.  These are no longer straws in the wind. In the Netherlands, members of Geert Wilders's Party for Freedom, which has peddled xenophobic rhetoric, are now in government after the party won last year's national vote. In Italy, Giorgia Meloni, who once lauded the policies of the fascist leader, Benito Mussolini, is prime minister. And in the United Kingdom, Nigel Farage's anti-immigrant Reform UK won a record 14% of the vote in the July election. Unlike Ms Meloni and the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands, the others on the far-Right that have had breakthrough gains, including the AfD in Germany, National Rally in France and Reform UK in Britain, are not yet in government. But, if recent history is any guide, their successes will pressure Centrist parties to tilt more to the Right to try and claw back voters they have lost. To some extent, that is a reflection of responsive politics. But unless traditional mainstream parties actually look to address growing worries about unemployment, soaring costs of living, and insecurity about the future, it is those who speak to such concerns who will gain. The answer to these legitimate grievances, ultimately, is more empathetic, economically sound, people-centred governance that works for everyone. Europe might be in churn now over these questions but the rest of the world is not immune from them either.",

        "Article Content": "It will probably be some time before last Monday\u2019s orders and observations by the three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by the Chief Justice of India are fully digested by the stakeholders in the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital imbroglio. At the time of writing (Tuesday afternoon), there are some stray points of clarity.  First, the appeal by the CJI to the striking junior doctors to return to work and prevent a collapse of the public health system has been interpreted by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress ecosystem as a victory of sorts. Bruised by the experience, the chief minister extended the hand of friendship and dialogue to the colleagues of \u2018Abhaya\u2019 \u2014 the junior doctor who was brutally raped and murdered at her place of work on August 9. However, the chief minister\u2019s apparent contrition was coupled with the astonishingly insensitive assertion that it was time for the people of West Bengal to forget the agitation and immerse themselves in \u2018festivities\u2019. At the same time, the chief minister (who also holds the health portfolio) didn\u2019t concede that her government had been guilty of any wrongdoing \u2014 whether over allegations of destruction of evidence or the attempted bribery of Abhaya\u2019s parents.  Secondly, perhaps because of the chief minister\u2019s rationed response to an upheaval that has rocked the state for a month, the response of the junior doctors was an insolent letter that made it clear that the agitation wasn\u2019t going to be withdrawn. The junior doctors were also loath to await the findings of the Central Bureau of Investigation on the important question of evidence tampering and other alleged police improprieties. They persisted with their demand that Calcutta\u2019s police commissioner, Vineet Goyal, must resign immediately.  Thirdly, going strictly by anecdotal evidence and social media postings of those who had immersed themselves in the movement, the instinctive reaction of the people involved in the Justice for Abhaya movement to the Supreme Court proceedings was one of outrage. The feeling is that the apex court had been unmindful of the public mood, had believed the spin of the state government of an imminent health crisis, and hadn\u2019t set clear deadlines for the CBI. This disappointment also reinforced a prevailing perception that the voice of ordinary Bengalis didn\u2019t matter to the Delhi Establishment. This, in turn, injected new life into the belief that there was a \u2018setting\u2019 between Mamata and Modi, a perception the Left has assiduously promoted.  Fourthly, there is a minority view among politicians in the anti-Mamata camp that the state government\u2019s position in the Abhaya case is precarious. If the CBI can confirm the widespread impression that there was a blatant disregard for procedures by the Kolkata Police and even a wilful suppression of evidence, it would put Mamata Banerjee in an untenable position. If this cover-up can be complemented by the CBI establishing corrupt practices in the institutions of medical education, the chief minister would find it very difficult to cling on to her position. Under the circumstances, they feel that the CBI must be put under sustained pressure to treat this investigation as its utmost priority. A section of the Bharatiya Janata Party is particularly invested in the Supreme Court being the harbinger of a regime change in West Bengal.  Conspiracy theorists also see a curious convergence between the interests of a section of the BJP and a so-called Camac Street faction of the Trinamool Congress. Last Saturday, at a Ganesh  hosted by a senior Union minister, I was asked by a senior BJP functionary if the prolonged agitation was being bankrolled by those in the Trinamool Congress who want Mamata to hang up her boots.  What is important is not the veracity of these whispers; they merely suggest that while there is a romance of street protests, the same turbulence offers alternative possibilities to others.  On earlier occasions when Bengal was rocked by political turbulence, there was persistent speculation that the Centre would step in to impose president\u2019s rule. The speculations were usually baseless since Supreme Court judgments have imposed stringent safeguards against the removal of elected governments. However, the whispers kept alive a low level of political discourse.  It is intriguing that the prognosis of the governor getting set for an enlarged role has barely registered during the Justice for Abhaya movement. There could be many reasons, including the inadvisability of making a martyr of Mamata Banerjee. What is also significant is that for the moment there are no obvious political gainers from such a colossal movement, although experience suggests that the principal Opposition party is the inevitable beneficiary.  This is not to suggest that neither the Left nor the BJP has attempted to take over the movement. The Left, far more experienced than the Bengal BJP in infiltrating and moulding movements, has had nominal success in spreading Left-inclined songs and slogans among the impressionable. In and around Jadavpur, the Left has successfully used the rhythmic chant of  \u2014 especially when the chanting is led by a Tollywood star \u2014 to motivate younger women. It is only a matter of time before the scope of  is extended to issues so dear to the urban Naxals. At the same time, the Left cannot but be mindful of the significance of the Tricolour emerging as the movement\u2019s sole identity. Its ideological posturing is unlikely to make a mark in this climate of virtuous uprightness. The BJP\u2019s role is a more mixed bag despite its lead role in the Nabanna march on August 27 and its 12-hour  the next day. It is an open secret that there is one section of the wider saffron fraternity that is wary of rocking the boat in a way that would be beneficial to the Left. Whether that section diverted energies into ineffective and largely invisible  is a matter of conjecture. What can be said with certainty is that the BJP\u2019s paucity of middle-class  bench-strength and its overall organisational weakness in the Greater Calcutta region prevented a more focussed intervention. The local party\u2019s curious aversion to newcomers, its hounding out of the celebrities who had teamed up with it in 2021, and the non-existence of a student wing may have also determined its feeble intervention. At the same time, if the Justice for Abhaya campaign widens into a movement against 13 years of Trinamool Congress misrule and moves beyond the cultural confines of Calcutta, the BJP will be the principal beneficiary. Yet, all conclusions are tentative. The mood in Bengal is still work in progress.",

        "Article Content": "The undercurrents of big-power politics and their possible fallouts have been a buzzword for long in the Northeast. The Myanmar crisis, following the February 2021 military coup, and, now, the regime change in Bangladesh bear fresh evidence of this. These neighbourhood troubles could have come from internal contradictions. But the possibility of big-power interests as a causal factor should not be dismissed considering the strategic importance of this geography. Thant Myint-U had anticipated this ( ) as also Bertil Lintner ( ). Both inferred that Western powers would certainly have an interest here. The region\u2019s colonial history should provide reasons for this caution. Not everything in this game is what it appears to be. The case of the India-China border standoff at Doklam in Sikkim over a road China was building is illustrative. China claimed, citing an 1890 boundary treaty with the British determining Sikkim\u2019s territorial extent, that the part of Doklam in which it was building the road belonged to it. The British did sign this treaty, and another, on trade concessions in Tibet, in 1893, but, interestingly, with China and not Tibet. Alastair Lamb has some answers to this in his two-volume  . In 1886, the British planned a trade mission to Lhasa led by the civil servant, Colman Macaulay. The Chinese, too weak to oppose the British, tried to dissuade this by saying that the Tibetans would oppose the plan, indicating their weak hold over Tibet. The Macaulay mission was ultimately abandoned. However, unaware of this, the Tibetans sent a detachment to the Sikkimese village of Lingtu, which they claimed was theirs, to blockade \u201cthe main road from Darjeeling to the Tibetan border at the Chumbi Valley, along which Colman Macaulay was expected to travel,\u201d writes Lamb. Despite appeals by the British, the Chinese did little. In 1888, Viceroy Dufferin authorised his troops to clear the blockade. Dufferin also became convinced that Tibet's affairs would be best dealt with Lhasa, not Peking. However, the 1890 and 1893 treaties were still signed with Peking, not Lhasa. Britain\u2019s anxiety, Lamb reasons, was that entering into treaties with Tibet would give a seal to Tibetans entering into similar treaties with Russia. This anxiety prompted Britain to force the St. Petersburg Convention 1907 on Russia which was then on the back foot, having suffered a naval defeat at the hands of Japan in 1905. To ensure that Russia was kept away from Tibet, the treaty made it a condition for Britain and Russia to deal with Tibet only through China\u2019s mediation. But the British ended up tying themselves up in knots. During the Simla Conference of 1913-1914 to define the India-Tibet boundary, China had to be made a party. China walked out of the conference and the rest is history. Dufferin\u2019s successor, Lord Curzon, was hawkish and adopted the former\u2019s doctrine of bypassing China in dealing with Tibet. When he became convinced that the 13th Dalai Lama was leaning towards Russia, he authorised the Francis Younghusband Mission to invade Tibet and force the Lhasa Convention 1904, virtually making Chumbi Valley, which includes Doklam, Indian territory. For Curzon, controlling Tibet was important for India\u2019s security. He spells this out in his Romanes Lecture 1907 titled \"Frontier\". However, Morley was scornful of the approach and wrote in a letter to Minto that \u201cthese frontier men\u201d cannot see the bigger picture. If not for this shadow war, it is likely that Tibet and Sikkim would have remained as Bhutan has, making India\u2019s Siliguri corridor's vulnerability quite different. Today, direct interventions by foreign powers are ruled out, but damages often come from the fallouts of these Cold Wars.",

        "Author Name": "The Editorial Board",
        "Author URL": null,
        "Article Content": "Sir \u2014 The list of reasons why the world is always angry with Gen Z is long. The latest entry in this list is their need to photograph airport security trays laden with their aesthetically arranged possessions \u2014 a carefully curated collection of items like vintage sunglasses, cute shoes, a travel-size perfume bottle, a trending paperback and so on. Anyone who has experienced the mad rush at airport security and the cut-throat competition for empty trays would, understandably, be irritated with such photo sessions holding up the queue. But the real culprit might not be Gen Z; it might be the ubiquitousness of the phone camera. After all, telling those close to us every little detail of our travel is not new \u2014 what earlier took hours of cramped writing on postcards to communicate can now be done with the click of a button. Sir \u2014 It is heartening that Naxal violence in India has reduced by 76% between 2010 and 2022 (\u201cMaoist death toll at 15-year high\u201d, Sept 8). Initiatives like Operation Green Hunt have gone a long way towards curbing the Naxalite violence. But parts of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha and Maharashtra are still under the shadow of Naxal violence. A multi-pronged strategy is necessary to eliminate this menace. A bottom-up approach to development and the use of modern technology like Artificial Intelligence for surveillance in dense forests, special rehabilitation packages, and building a robust socio-economic infrastructure are steps that can eradicate Naxal insurgency completely. Sir \u2014 Once again, the Union home minister, Amit Shah, has said that the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance government will free India of left-wing extremism by March 2026. But Shah had made a similar promise, albeit with a deadline of March 2024, last year. Several historical and socio-economic factors led people to turn to Maoism. Economic development in the impoverished regions afflicted by Maoism can root out this kind of violence. Sir \u2014 The recently passed Maharashtra special public security bill, 2024 gives the state government the power to label people as \u2018Naxals\u2019. One must ask why this bill was tabled without adequate discussion on the issue. Has there been a spurt in Naxalite activity in the state? If so, why has the evidence not been published in the public domain? The bill is intended to intimidate political opponents of the Bharatiya Janata Party and arm the police with draconian powers. The vague and generalised definitions in the poorly drafted bill leave room for arbitrary interpretations.  Sir \u2014 The right-wing is an exceptionally sensitive bunch (\u201cGets under the skin\u201d, Sept 8). Why is it that people on that end of the political spectrum are so unwilling to budge from their point of view or accept the correctness of other schools of thought? There is just one reason behind this: hatred is what gets them votes. The Centre and the Left also need to introspect about how to counter the culture of intolerance that is being spread by the Right. Sir \u2014 Much is written and said about the dangers of the overuse of antibiotics. But antibiotics are not the only drugs sold over the counter. Another popular medicine these days is montelukast, an oral medicine prescribed for long-term use to control asthma and allergic rhinitis. This drug has serious neuropsychiatric side effects \u2014 a British teenager who had been on montelukast for two years committed suicide after struggling to cope with mental health issues. Yet, it is widely prescribed to Indians, who, given the country\u2019s high levels of pollution, are particularly prone to lung ailments. In a country where post-marketing surveillance of medicines tends to be limited and mental health issues are largely under-reported and stigmatised, we need to raise awareness about this drug. Sir \u2014 A nation cannot progress unless its people are ready to toil (\u201cThe sloths\u201d, Sept 10). According to a report, 155 million Indian adults and 45 million adolescents do not meet the required levels of physical activity laid down by the World Health Organization. A few years ago, a Fitbit survey found Indians to be the laziest people in the world. A sedentary lifestyle makes people prone to serious medical conditions. This, in turn, has a serious impact on the economy of the country. Lazy people are a threat to global health and the world economy. Sir \u2014 Air pollution worsens each winter. It is thus crucial to take preventive steps before the arrival of the cold months when we are susceptible to respiratory ailments owing to air pollution. For instance, as we approach the festive months, we should not burn firecrackers. It is heartening then that Delhi has imposed a ban on the production, storage, and selling of firecrackers until January 1. Sir \u2014 For the swipe-right Gen Z, the thrill of surprise connections made in unexpected places might be foreign territory. This is probably why some hobby applications such as Strava, a platform for runners, or Letterboxd, an app for cinephiles, now appear to be doubling up as no-pressure dating zones. Hobby apps afford youngsters the chance to forge a connection over a shared interest before moving things to the next stage, not to mention make real-life bonds that cannot be replaced by online romance.",

        "Article Content": "Junior doctors in Calcutta have refused to join work, saying that their protest shall continue until all their demands have been fulfilled. The Supreme Court had reportedly asked them to end their ceasework by 5 pm on September 10, assuring the protesting doctors that no action would be taken against them if they did so. If, however, they did not, adverse action could be taken against them. This was the third time that the Supreme Court had asked them to join work. This time the Trinamool Congress, too, had the same request, citing their oath to heal the sick. The junior doctors\u2019 strike began after the rape and murder of their colleague in R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital on August 9 with demands for its investigation, for security and proper conditions of work and rest in hospitals, the removal of the principal of R.G. Kar Hospital and so on. The principal was removed, some other officials too, and the probe is with the Central Bureau of Investigation with the Supreme Court keeping a close eye on it. The health department claims that safety features, resting areas and washrooms are being introduced, although they cannot be completed by September 10. Meanwhile, the junior doctors\u2019 demands have grown in number. In the latest set of conditions for their return to work are the resignation of the police chief, the health secretary, the director of health education and the director of health services, the last three to \u2018cleanse\u2019 the health sector. Their prolonged absence from work has meant an enormous load for senior doctors; even then many patients are going untreated while surgeries and medical tests are being cancelled. So far it has been claimed that over 20 patients have died because of lack of treatment. This is a tragic outcome. But even if so many patients had not died, it cannot be denied that the junior doctors\u2019 prime responsibility is towards their patients. Their anger and suspicions are understandable, so is their need to protest and to register their grief and horror at the violent death of their colleague. Their protest was greeted with sympathy and admiration in the first few days. But should doctors hold the state to ransom at the cost of human lives? They have raised many crucial questions, but this is a question they must answer.",

        "Article Content": "Art in Life at the CIMA Gallery, has, once again, with its varied display of India\u2019s rich cultural storehouse, gained Kolkata\u2019s attention. On till October 9, the exhibition is the perfect pre-Puja shopping opportunity for those who enjoy carrying, wearing or owning a piece of India.  The exhibition was already busy on its first few days, as some of the most familiar faces of Tollywood and of Kolkata came to check out the exhibits this year. Actor and fashion designer, Sujoy Prasad Chatterjee, was already excited to share his thoughts on the Rajasthani temple jewellery pieces from Mireya Jewels that were on display for the first three days of the exhibition.  \u201cCIMA Art in Life brings together a plethora of art forms from all across the country,\u201d said Chatterjee to  . \u201cThis exhibition is a signature of harmony in many ways. When times are difficult, harmony is always in tumult. Art in Life brings together a lot of art and artistry to bridge the gaps among us.\u201d  For Chatterjee, Art in Life is a cultural celebration. Dressed in a plain black kurta and  , the actor showed off a maximalist neck piece by Mireya Jewels, with beadwork and a lion insignia on each end. Helming Mireya Jewels was Vinesh Kumar Maheshwari, whose temple jewellery exhibits, designed by veteran jeweller Kundan Lal Verma, graced the exhibition. As Chatterjee put it, \u201cI look forward to being a part of Art in Life. I\u2019m here both as an artist and as a customer. It\u2019s a nice feeling wearing a creation of the artist here.\u201d Chatterjee also added on his role as a customer: \u201cI\u2019ve already looked at some little closets to take home today. I always look for jewellery boxes and those closets would be perfect. I\u2019ve already booked mine!\u201d  Chatterjee was also enamoured by the stoles on display. Made from various South Indian silks, these scarves and stoles come in different styles, made for both everyday use and festive outfits.  Finally, Chatterjee expressed how he wants to invite viewers to check out the stall set up by Mrittika Earthy Talks, an environmental conservation group spearheaded by Somini Sen Dua. The stall has on display upcycled materials that help conserve the environment. Rakhi Sarkar, director of CIMA, focused on the multidimensional nature of the art that finds space in the exhibition. \u201cPreserving the traditional art forms is necessary, and CIMA fosters a union of this tradition with the modern,\u201d she said. Minnie Juneja, president of the Ladies Study Group, expressed her heartfelt gratitude towards Sarkar and the initiative of CIMA. \u201cArt in Life is the most anticipated lifestyle event of Kolkata,\u201d she said, \u201coffering Ladies Study Group members an enriching experience of art, culture, textiles, and handicrafts from across India.\u201d Juneja was especially enamoured by the divine Nakshi designs of Indian deities that are on display at the exhibition, designed by Kundan Lal Verma. She especially appreciated the blending of digital media with art to make it more accessible.  Pratiti Basu Sarkar, chief administrator of CIMA, donned a  -cotton dress for the preview of the exhibition. \u201cGoing back to such eco-friendly materials like   is vital to remember how diverse Indian textile and art are,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is by working with Art in Life that I have learned about India, its art and culture. In fact, it was by meeting the artists that I learned not only about India\u2019s history, but also its geography: how people eat, speak, think \u2014 both their language and way of life. It has literally been a journey of discovery.\u201d  Pondering upon the exhibits, Basu Sarkar had a hard time choosing a favourite. But for her the traditional artworks stood out. She especially liked a traditional painting poised at the entrance of the exhibition. She also wanted to pick a textile, but instead of a sari, she chose a quilt. \u201cThese are embroidered by men, part of a community of snake charmers known as the Saami. These quilts are popular in arid regions. The patterns are similar to snake skin, and largely abstract.\u201d \u201cWhen we encountered them on our travels, they took us into their homes and laid out the quilts,\u201d Basu Sarkar recounted, \u201cand told us that these textiles are what they use to sit on while performing, and also to cover themselves while travelling at night.\u201d  Art in Life is also currently displaying art forms from all across India, with a special focus on Rajasthan, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Bengal.  , one of the founders of the Ladies Study Group, had a gala time asking the attendees about what they\u2019d like to pick from the exhibition. Herself a fan of statement jewellery, Bhagat picked an eye-catching neck piece with rubies and a signature stone in the centre, along with a pair of sapphire earrings. \u201cThe intricacy of the work is astounding, and the  \u2019s patience in setting each minute stone or thread in place is admirable,\u201d she said. \u201cI commend CIMA\u2019s contribution towards highlighting India\u2019s artists.\u201d   Bhagat also spoke to Nishant Upadhyay, the brain behind the layout of the exhibition, about his thoughts. Upadhyay, who is an interior designer by profession, spoke about the focus on eco-friendly materials as part of the exhibition. He especially focused on the jewellery exhibits which sat on stands lined by hay. He also described how he manually crafted the mannequin bust heads for the jewellery display. When asked by Bhagat about his pick from the accessories on display, Upadhyay chose a subtle sapphire wrist band for his mother. ",

        "Article Content": "A study published in the journal,  , has revealed that India is responsible for 20% \u2014 one-fifth \u2014 of the global plastic pollution, making it the world\u2019s biggest polluter by surpassing China and the United States of America. India burns roughly 5.8 million tonnes of plastic each year and releases another 3.5 mt of plastics into the environment as debris. Admittedly, a lot of this plastic waste is not generated by India. More than 25 countries dumped about 78,000 mt of plastic waste in India in 2023, according to some estimates, even though the import of plastic waste is banned in India. But it cannot be denied that India has a waste management problem of its own. In an audit in 2023, the Central Pollution Control Board found over 6,00,000 fake pollution-trading certificates from just four of the 2,348 plastic waste recyclers registered with it. Moreover, although India forbade 19 single-use plastic items like spoons, straws, plates and polythene bags that are less than 120 microns thick in 2022, the CPCB is on record saying that the law is flouted with impunity. Even waste that is properly managed in India extracts a steep human cost \u2014 some 1.5 million waste-pickers, including women, children and the elderly, play a critical role in waste management and resource efficiency by collecting, sorting, trading and sometimes even reinserting discarded waste back into the economy. Yet, they face systemic marginalisation due to non-recognition, non-representation, and exclusion from social security schemes and legal protection frameworks. In India, despite regulatory measures, their effective implementation and enforcement remain challenges in combating plastic pollution. Robust enforcement and ensuring compliance with existing laws coupled with public awareness campaigns and educational programmes are crucial to curbing the proliferation of plastic waste. The   study also comes at a time when negotiations for the first legally binding international treaty on plastics pollution \u2014 arguably the most important environmental pact after the Paris Agreement \u2014 are ongoing. However, consensus on what it should entail has been hard to come by. India has aligned with countries like Saudi Arabia that have plastic-petrochemical interests to insist that the treaty should focus on downstream waste management and not curb production. This reflects a blatant disregard for the scientific eviden\u00adce surrounding climate change. No country can afford to shirk its responsibility of reducing plastic waste any longer given that each person consumes a credit-card-sized amount of microplastics every week on average.",

        "Article Content": "Climate change isn\u2019t just scorching summers, raging wildfires, or coastal populations sinking into the sea. It\u2019s also about military security. As the polar ice recedes, the Arctic, once a desolate expanse of frozen wilderness, is fast becoming the world\u2019s newest strategic arena. Sea lanes that were once impassable are opening up, oil and gas reserves long locked beneath ice are now accessible, and the Arctic is quickly transforming from frozen obscurity to a site of conflict. Climate change, far from an abstract threat, is reshaping the contours of global security. This isn\u2019t hyperbole. On Tuesday, Russia\u2019s defence ministry released footage on Telegram of joint Arctic naval drills with China. These war games, scheduled to run until September 16, are about Russia projecting strength along what could be the next military frontier. The once silent, frozen North is thawing, and Russia has planted its flag squarely on the softening ground. The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world. Global temperatures have risen by an average of 1.1\u00b0C since the Industrial Revolution but in the Arctic, that number has been closer to 3\u00b0C since the 1980s. The ice is retreating with an alarming speed. Northern members of NATO, Norway in particular, are caught between environmental aspirations and the demands of global energy markets. They now face the unenviable task of managing a crisis that they have unwittingly helped fuel. The Arctic, in Moscow\u2019s view, is not just a resource grab; it\u2019s longstanding territory. In 2021, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, had made his stance clear: \u201cIt has been absolutely clear for everyone for a long time that this is our territory...\u201d Russia has taken that statement seriously, building infrastructure across more than 4,300 miles of its Siberian Arctic plateau, revamping ports, building new civilian outposts, and is even constructing a floating nuclear power plant. Seventeen full-service ports are in the works along the Northern Sea Route as Moscow angles to control the critical arteries that have opened up in the wake of the retreating ice. But even with its vast Arctic coastline, Moscow\u2019s grip isn\u2019t ironclad. The Northern Fleet, Russia\u2019s crown jewel of nuclear deterrence, is confined by the harsh geography of the Kola Peninsula. Its submarines must navigate the shallow Barents Sea under NATO\u2019s watchful eye. This tension highlights Russia\u2019s precarious position despite its ambition. Norway, on NATO\u2019s leading northern flank, is more critical than ever as Sweden and Finland have joined the alliance recently. A founding member of NATO, Norway has pledged an unprecedented defence expansion, increasing conscripts from 9,000 to 13,500, and boosting defence spending by 51 billion Norwegian Euros over the next dozen years. This is a historic shift from neutral Norway, which has long blended policies of deterrence with reassurance to maintain relations with Russia for decades. But context matters. For comparison, Poland has spent an equivalent of 4.12% of its GDP on defence, which is the highest level among NATO members and more than double the alliance\u2019s 2% of GDP guideline. Poland is among the less affluent nations of the NATO alliance, with its GDP   being just a little more than half of Norway\u2019s. Nevertheless, Poland boasts a conscript force of 200,000 and spent 23 billion euros on defence in 2023 alone. Norway\u2019s defence budget, even with its eye-catching increase, pales in comparison. For a country sitting on NATO\u2019s Arctic doorstep, and in comparison to other member states, are Norway\u2019s contributions adequate or equitable? Norway\u2019s role in this Arctic drama is also riddled with contradictions. The nation is a global paragon of climate action, proudly pledging a plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2030. But beneath this veneer of environmental responsibility lies a glaring paradox: Norway is one of the world\u2019s largest exporters of oil and gas. Demand for Norwegian resources are only increasing since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as allies boycott Russian oil and gas. Norway stands as the fifth-largest oil exporter and third-largest natural gas supplier and exports reached their highest amount in a decade in 2023. While its domestic efforts to curb emissions are commendable, the oil rigs scattered across the North Sea continue to churn out the very fuel that accelerates the melting of the polar ice \u2014 and, with it, the very crisis that threatens Norway\u2019s own security. In this sense, Norway has positioned itself as both the healer and the harmer. As the ice melts, so too does its credibility as a global climate leader. Poland\u2019s approach is also not without criticism. Global dependency on oil and gas strengthens Russia, no matter which way you look at it. Whether these resources are purchased directly from Russia or not, carbon-based fuel usage is melting the north, which Russia is well-prepared to dominate. In Poland\u2019s case, instead of using some of its budget on military expenses, it could invest in carbon neutral infrastructure that would reduce its overall dependency on oil and gas and, thereby, do its part to prevent new military opportunities for Russia. Compared to Norway, Poland has drastically deprioritised carbon neutrality, offering climate plans that rely on emission absorption rather than emission reduction. It is also making relatively distant commitments in comparison to other nations. The Arctic\u2019s transformation isn\u2019t just a Russia-NATO stand-off. China\u2019s growing interest in the region and its increased friendship with Russia are concerning those who see China\u2019s power as a potential threat for global stability. The United States of America has started responding with Arctic military drills named \u2018Operation Polar Dagger\u2019, a testament to the shifting focus on the region. Climate change is no longer an abstract environmental issue, something to be addressed by future generations or with feel-good global accords that kick the climate can down the road. It is here, it is now, and it is driving geopolitical realignments with breathtaking speed. The Arctic, once an afterthought in global power struggles, is now at the centre of the world\u2019s next great contest for resources and strategic dominance. If NATO is serious about Arctic defence, it must first take climate change seriously. The far north is becoming a crucible for international conflict and unless the West faces the harsh reality that the melting ice is more than just an environmental tragedy, it will be caught flat-footed in the global race for the Arctic. Norway, for its part, must reconcile its dual role as Arctic\u2019s defender and offender. It can no longer afford to be both an oil giant and a climate hero. Something\u2019s got to give. Other NATO allies must also do their part by shifting their thinking about contributions from being solely in terms of military capabilities to investments in carbon neutrality to slow or even stop polar melting. The Arctic is heating up \u2014 both literally and figuratively. The Arctic is no longer a remote, icy expanse and climate change is not just an environmental concern, but a strategic one as well. As the ice melts, the world\u2019s future is increasingly bound to the far north. If we fail to confront the twin crises of climate change and the militarisation of the Arctic, we risk losing more than just polar ice. We risk stability itself.",

        "Article Content": "Less than two months before the presidential elections in the United States of America, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the former president, Donald Trump, faced off in their first and possibly only debate on Tuesday night in Philadelphia. The two contestants had never met before, and the occasion was widely billed by pundits as an opportunity for the American public and the world to learn more about the policies that Ms Harris and Mr Trump would pursue if they won the election. Yet in 90 minutes of sparring, neither major party candidate offered any fresh insight into how they would approach either domestic challenges, such as soaring grocery bills and climate change, or global crises like the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. Instead, tens of millions of viewers in the US and around the world witnessed the latest episode of the predictable reality television that masquerades as electoral politics in the world\u2019s second-largest democracy. Ms Harris and Mr Trump traded barbs, each accusing the other of weakening democracy, damaging the US economy, and making the world less safe. There were bizarre moments, from Mr Trump claiming, without evidence, that Haitian immigrants were eating their neighbours\u2019 pets to Ms Harris effectively blaming her opponent for handing Afghanistan over to the Taliban, when it was her administration, under President Joe Biden, that carried through the chaotic US withdrawal from Kabul.  Far too often, the debate felt like a sequel that repeated a script that the US and the world have seen too many times before. Ms Harris accused Mr Trump of being soft on Russia, while Mr Trump blamed Ms Harris for a porous southern border. Neither pushed the other \u2014 and the moderators did not either \u2014 to flesh out exactly how they would control inflation, increase jobs, or end the wars in Europe and the Middle East that the US is deely involved in. By most accounts, Ms Harris delivered a stronger debate performance than her rival. But US voters and a world affected significantly by America\u2019s choices deserve better than such a performance. In the past, presidential debates have often had little impact on voter choices, although there have been exceptions. It is unclear whether the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s debate will be any different. What is clear is that irrespective of which candidate experts declare as the winner of the debate, US voters and those observing the election around the world lost out. ",

        "Article Content": "In the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections, a group of young men in rural Maharashtra joked to me about their precarious situation. They are educated, they said, but unemployed and unmarried. That small group of men in their early to mid-thirties, from a small cotton-growing village, actually echoed the sentiments you come across in large swathes of India. Education \u2014 quality, English-medium education \u2014 is a ticket to jobs. Jobs are a ticket to finding good life partners. That unmarried, educated women from the countryside are reluctant to marry into farming households and move into other villages where life and living are not kosher is a fact that is starkly obvious. It is worse in regions suffering from climatic aberrations such as frequent floods or cyclical droughts. Their priority is to marry into families in small towns where their future husbands would have a steady government or private-sector job. That explains the anger and anxiety prevailing in small towns and rural India, particularly among the country\u2019s working-age population. Farming is not paying and jobs are few and far between. Even meagerly paying government jobs, with permanence and certainty, have the first preference among the youths in the working age over private-sector, contractual jobs. Close to two million youths applied for 20,000-odd police con\u00adstabulary positions in Ma\u00adharashtra. Close to 4,00,000 people, which included 40,000 graduates and post-graduates, threw their hat in the ring last week in Haryana to bag contractual jobs for sweepers. The Indian IT firms have reportedly delayed onboarding of freshers, who have offer letters for more than two years. Across rural India, rackets of providing job letters \u2014 and not actual jobs \u2014 to men to materialise marriages are on the rise. Gangs that fleece men and women with the promise of jobs and marriages have a free run. The less that is said about job examinations where the papers are always leaked the better. In the absence of meaningful employment, what is attracting young people is speculative investments: share market, FnO, rummy apps, easy loan apps,   markets, and traditional and digital gambling, among a range of other options, are gaining traction, particularly among the youth, owing to social media. Unemployment is the elephant in the room. Unemploy\u00adability is even worse. As this column is being written,  is running a series on how \u2018skil\u00adled\u2019 Indian workers recruited by foreign firms have left their employers scrat\u00adching their heads over the lack of basic skills in these men who have ultimately been sacked and sent home. That India is sending men to Israel to take over jobs meant for Palestinians is a different story. Unemployment, rural crisis, ecological devastation, rise of cronyism, breakdown in governance, death of universal values, increasing attacks and sexual assaults on women of all ages, widening of social and economic inequalities, religious bigotry, near-stagnant production and manufacturing, and political-criminal-contractor nexus in government contracts are all inter-connected and form what the historian, Adam Tooze, calls a \u201cpoly-crisis\u201d. Amidst all this tumult, the State\u2019s political response to the economic and social conundrums seems to be a one-stop solution: direct cash transfers or monetary promises to constituencies that would help political parties keep the throne and momentarily tide over the crisis until the next one shows up. But things have come to a boil. The silence of the Indian elite, however, allows an unchecked run to self-appointed experts on YouTube with their 30-second reels, giving half-baked and preposterous   on every issue under the sun. We perhaps need a resurrection of sanity and values within our institutions, a re-imagination to bring our national life on the tracks.",

        "Article Content": "Suicide prevention strategies must broaden their scope. This was the message broadcast both nationally and internationally \u2014 the latter in  on World Suicide Prevention Day Public health experts in India communicated the importance of social risk factors to policymakers, saying that suicide was not a mental health issue alone. This is also the conclusion of the researchers in the Lancet, written on this year\u2019s theme of changing the narrative on suicide. This is of the utmost importance to India, where suicide rates are higher than the global average. One study showed over 2,30,000 suicide deaths in 2016. The most tragic aspect of this is that 40% of these are of young people. India\u2019s share in world suicide deaths increased from about 25% in 1990 to 36% in 2016. This would suggest that prevention strategies are not working as they should. Perhaps the national suicide prevention strategy produced by the Union health ministry in 2022 emphasising mental health was not adequate. Helplines and clinical interventions are certainly indispensable, but primary causes must also be sought in social and economic factors. In India, these causes are hardly indiscernible. Farmers\u2019 suicides because of debt were one example. Even today, debt remains a cause of suicide. Unemployment, domestic violence, addiction, a sense of isolation are obvious causes, while suicide deaths in high-pressure institutions such as the coaching centres in Kota are a revealing example of the complex reasons for young people\u2019s despair. Students\u2019 suicides increase by 4% every year, double the national rate of increase, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Besides, a number of tragedies show that alleged caste discrimination and harassment can lead to suicide even in India\u2019s most prestigious institutions. Domestic violence, much of it silent, is, again, a persistent issue. In 2021, homemakers accounted for 51.5% of the total number of women\u2019s suicides. Even if this does not mean they all suffered from domestic violence, it also does not mean that all the deaths occurred solely from mental health problems. Addressing social risk factors, including financial, educational and gender-based issues, is uncomfortable, because it leads to questions about the quality of life based on governmental policies and practices. Yet that is the only way, coupled with clinical help, that can bring people back from the edge of hopelessness. ",

        "Article Content": "Sir \u2014 Surveillance versus privacy has been a topic of raging debate since the arrest of the co-founder of Telegram and the banning of X in Brazil. Adding fuel to the fire, the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, recently said that his government will ban teenagers from accessing social media. The idea behind this \u2014 the need to protect youngsters from cyber threats before they are mature enough to understand the perils of social media \u2014 is laudable. But children would benefit more from gradually learning to use the internet while being monitored rather than dealing with a sudden exposure to social media later in life. Sir \u2014 The recent flare-up of violence in Manipur indicates that contrary to the claims made by the Centre and the state government, normalcy is yet to return to the region (\u201cKuki ex-soldier killed on Meitei turf\u201d, Sept 10). The tension can escalate into riots again if the situation is not addressed urgently. The Centre must make sure that the territorial integrity of Manipur is maintained. The chasm between the Kuki-Zo people and the Meiteis has deepened. The indifference of the government has cost Manipur numerous lives and led to the mass displacement of people. It is ironic that followers of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, claim that he can stop international wars while he remains incapable of solving domestic problems. Sir \u2014 Manipur has relapsed into ethnic skirmishes, once again. Narendra Modi has done precious little to solve the burning issues plaguing the state. Even as Manipur sees a resurgence of communal violence, incidents of cow vigilantism have started recurring in other states. Modi must now turn his attention away from international tours to douse the fires at home. Sir \u2014 Restoring law and order requires more than just promises. The government must bring the situation in Manipur under control by cracking down on extremist groups. The demand for a separate administration is unjustified. The state and the Central government must promptly take ameliorative steps. Sir \u2014 The government must oppose the demand for a separate administration in Manipur. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in Manipur should stop spreading its divisive propaganda in the state before it is too late. Sir \u2014 Despite tall claims by the BJP-led government, violence has become normalised in the country. Terrorist activities, internal strife, riots and looting have been occuring unabated in India. However, Manipur\u2019s problem has acquired an important dimension with the usage of rockets and drones by the extremists. This is an issue of national security. Instead of shifting the blame on the erstwhile Congress government, the Centre needs to get a grip on the situation. The BJP government has been vocal in demanding the resignation of chief ministers of states that are ruled by Opposition parties. What happens to such a demand when it comes to states under its own rule? Sir \u2014 New Delhi has shown little interest in addressing the socio-political tensions in Manipur. The state has been left to fend for itself. Charity should begin at home. Instead of trying to broker peace between other nations, the Centre would do well to mitigate domestic troubles. Sir \u2014 People in West Bengal have decided not to celebrate Durga Puja on a grand scale this year owing to the rape and murder of a young doctor at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital (\u201cWeavers\u2019 woes: Protests take a toll on Puja sari sales\u201d, Sept 9). This can cause a loss of nearly 35 crore for several traders. In spite of this, the solidarity shown with the victim is commendable. The West Bengal government must clean up its act. The chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, seems unmoved by people\u2019s plight. Sir \u2014 Many Durga Puja committees in West Bengal have returned the state government\u2019s financial aid. This is a protest against the government\u2019s continued inaction regarding women\u2019s safety in Bengal. However, this has caused problems for   Several committees are choosing not to hire  and going for a small-scale celebrations instead. The loss of livelihood for the  is a serious concern. The Puja organising committees should consider hiring  by cutting down on other ritualistic expenditures. Sir \u2014 Durga Puja generates a trade of nearly 40,000 crore. However, this year, owing to the ongoing protests, wholesalers and retailers will face severe economic setbacks. The protestors should consider this.",

        "Article Content": "The city of joy is sprinkled with stories all around. Not all of those make it to the pages of a book. While some are tucked away in the nooks and corners of the city, waiting to be explored, some of it stays with the people dwelling in the city. And, these stories are perhaps best unravelled through walks and talks. It demands to be felt, heard, and witnessed. This is exactly what various walking tour organisations of Calcutta offer. While keeping in mind education and conservation, these groups also curate trails around the city in a manner where one gets to experience diverse aspects of the city life while imbibing knowledge about the same. They allow their guests to explore and experience it first-hand while knowing about the city and its people. The pandemic, however, has made it impossible to continue this discovering and rediscovering. That, however, hasn\u2019t deterred the curators. Like every other industry, they too are learning the ropes anew, bringing new experiences on the plate and making all of it accessible from the safety and comfort of your homes. Calcutta has no doubt always attracted tourists \u2014 be it for its history, heritage, traditions, festivals, cultural diversity, or the wide variety of food. In the last five years, however, the mushrooming of various walking tour organisations around the city changed the concept of touring the city quite a bit. Rather than focussing on the predictable like a Victoria Memorial or an Indian Museum, these curated trails focus on specific aspects of the city or diverse themes, while informing people of the past alongside giving them a chance to understand the present. Sukti Sarkar, 61, an avid traveller and a retired assistant manager of Reserve Bank of India, has been participating in walks conducted by Immersive Trails (formerly Heritage Walk Calcutta) since 2017. \u201cI have participated in walking city tours in cities like Berlin and Copenhagen earlier. In 2017, when I came across an ad on Facebook featuring Heritage Walk Calcutta\u2019s Other Colonies Day Tour, the name sounded intriguing and I participated in it. The stories I got to know during the walk were fascinating. Last year, during my daughter\u2019s wedding reception a programme was arranged by her to take her foreigner friends and others who came from outside Calcutta to a customised walking tour with HWC. The guests enjoyed it a lot,\u201d she says. Navpreet Arora left her job at a mutual fund company when she realised that she was keen on showing people the Calcutta as she saw it and started her tour company FunOnStreets in September 2016. She has curated around 15-17 specialised theme-based walks. From food trails and cultural trails to historical trails, she weaves her stories on various aspects of the city on her walks \u201cwith a focus on history\u201d. Immersive Trails started their journey in February 2017 and has nine theme-based trails across the city like the World War II Walk, the China Town Walk, Chitpore Walk and the Dalhousie Square Walk. \u201cWe connect places with the stories based on archival and ethnographical research,\u201d said Tathagata Neogi, co-founder. Soham Chakrabarty quit his IT job with a desire to do something new. After interacting with guests at the Airbnb homestay owned by his parents, he found that people wanted to see Calcutta from a local perspective. Thus started Calcutta Capsule in March 2017, offering three unique ways to discover the city. The Magic Hour Tour allows people to experience the early morning Calcutta, just at the break of dawn, by going around the city in various local transports like the ferry, tram and bus. Breakfast by the river and a walk through Kumartuli wraps it up. There is a food tour through the alleys of North Calcutta while stopping at famous eateries to taste their renowned dishes. The Calcutta Contrast tour is based on Satyajit Ray\u2019s Jana Aranya or The Middleman. Two ways of life that are a complete contrast to each other\u2014 the busy lanes of Burrabazar and the laid-back vibe of College Street\u2019s Coffee House are juxtaposed. The tourists can sample Bengali and Marwari cuisines. Jenn Smith, who visited Calcutta during the Durga Puja last year from the US after winning a trip to India from her participation in a special programme, said: \u201cI was hoping to learn more about the city that I was born in (Calcutta) and found Soham\u2019s tours on Airbnb. It was my first trip to Calcutta and Soham was marketing himself as a guy from this city. What better than to know about the city from someone who is so passionate about it. Participating in his tours opened my heart to the city. His tours were interesting because of the secret spots, the food and the interactive session with the locals. The virtual tours will surely deprive one of the sensory aspects involved in his tours. But since he is a good storyteller, it could be interesting too\u201d.  Only a year old, Walk Calcutta Walk founded in 2019 and run by the two-man team of Ayon Mandal and Deep Bhattacharya, conducts a 12 series theme-based walk on history, culture, literature, mystery, tradition, festivals and food of Calcutta such as Bonedi Barir Pujo, Europe On Ganges, Graveyard Hunting, Tram Kotha and Museum Walk.   Their shorter tours are three-four hours long and the longer ones comprise breakfast and lunch, as food plays an important role in their curated walks. Knowing and relishing goes hand in hand for them. The scorching summer and monsoons are generally considered off-season, but due to the pandemic, the virtual platform made a lean season quite busy for many of these organisations.          Immersive Trails had stopped their physical walks a week before the lockdown. \u201cWe were deciding on how to negotiate the situation. So we took Covid as an opportunity to reach out to the audience worldwide with our endeavour,\u201d says Neogi. Many of their physical walks are already being conducted virtually on Zoom with a maximum of 30 people. Each walk is 1.5-2 hours long. You can pay and register. \u201cWe are interspersing our storytelling with audio-visuals, archival videos, and walkthrough videos along with an interactive session because, in our physical walks, interactive sessions played an important role,\u201d says Neogi. Since the time they started their virtual walks, the agency has witnessed participation from \u201c95 cities and 12 countries worldwide\u201d. \u201cI am a heritage enthusiast. My hobby is reading about Calcutta and taking photographs. I have attended around 30-40 heritage walks in the last two years and have attended almost all the walks by Immersive Trails including the virtual ones too that they started during the lockdown. It is a good experience but is also a setback for people like us who love to go around exploring the city,\u201d says Priyodorshi Mustafi, a software professional and a regular participant of Immersive Trails. For Navpreet Arora of FunOnStreets, conducting these virtual walks is more of a \u201cbrand-building exercise\u201d. \u201cDuring these unprecedented times, we have to keep creating. I started a series called Treasure Trails. It was a creative buzz. So my friends suggested why not do a virtual walk. So, we did a trial walk in June with a few of my clients. From July onwards we planned walks every week with a maximum of 30 people. While conducting our physical walks we try to connect people to the history through pictures also while walking. We are conducting our pre-booked, paid virtual walks the same way,\u201d says Arora. Entrepreneur Vineeta Gupta, owner of the brand Earthwear and one of Arora\u2019s tour loyalists, says: \u201cI have been associated with her physical walks for a long time and  I had a wonderful experience. When she, however, started her virtual tours, I was in two minds. When I finally made up my mind to participate, I didn\u2019t realise where one-and-a-half hours had swept by. Her Park Street walk, North Calcutta and Kumartuli walk are some of my favourites. The pandemic has opened up new areas of exploration for all of us. I would have not gone for the virtual walk otherwise. The pandemic showed how we can do interesting things sitting at home also.\u201d The idea of doing virtual walks came to Ayon and Deep of Walk Calcutta Walk when their scheduled popular Finding Felu Tour on Satyajit Ray\u2019s birthday, May 2, got postponed due to the pandemic. \u201cWe thought we should not give up. We should improvise. Despite the technical difficulties that we faced initially, we had many people joining in from Europe and America. As we had so many people wanting to participate, we made it invite-only. More than 200-300 people joined. Srijit Mukherji and Biswajit Chatterjee joined us for a special live session too. We are conducting our virtual walks on Skype and Facebook. We narrate the story along with audio and pictures and videos. It is interactive. We are also trying to come up with new stories for our virtual walks,\u201d they say. Covid has brought about a sea change in the participation. It is no longer restricted to small groups of people, present in Calcutta, who can go around the city on foot. Taking it on virtual platforms made it accessible to people all around the globe from the comfort of their homes.                  Immersive Trails is usually approached by both locals and tourists for booking their walking tours. \u201cSeventy per cent of our participants are from Calcutta but the ratio changed significantly after we introduced virtual walks from June onwards. We are now getting a lot of global participation,\u201d says Neogi, who started the virtual walks after conducting a Facebook poll to understand the interest of people in such walks. Navpreet Arora conducts private tours as well as group tours and takes around 15 participants for her scheduled walks about which she posts on FB. \u201cFrom Pujas to winter, a lot of people come to our city. My clientele comprises tourists as well as local people. From students, corporate professionals, and various groups like Ladies Study Group, the participants belong to diverse backgrounds. But in the virtual walk, we are witnessing participation by a global audience. We are also adjusting the timing of our virtual walks in such a manner so that people belonging to different time zones can participate and we are mostly keeping it for the weekends so that people are free to join,\u201d says Arora.    Walk Calcutta Walk conducts walks throughout the year in groups of six-eight people and a maximum of 10. Their food walks, however, sometimes have over 25 participants. You can book a tour through Facebook, web portals, website, and WhatsApp. \u201cNinety per cent of our participants are from Calcutta. During winter, we have participants from foreign countries as well. While conducting our walks, we tell the stories in both English and Bengali. The participants in our virtual walks have increased. The best part is that aged people who couldn\u2019t go out, are getting a glimpse of the city through these virtual walks,\u201d say Ayon and Deep. Neogi agrees that the experience of virtual walks would never match that of physical walks. \u201cWhen you are out on the street, smelling, seeing things for yourself, is obviously more rewarding, but we have to think of ways of how we can deliver best during the pandemic. All our tickets for the virtual walk were sold out within 48 hours and it was purchased by people all over the world. We did not expect that. Covid is a problem in the travel industry but we have to innovate as much as we can. We took it as an opportunity,\u201d he says. For Arora, it is a challenge to recreate the interactive sessions of her physical walks for her guests on the virtual medium. \u201cWhen you walk around the city, you feel the pulse of the city. My foreign guests like to interact with people on the street. People can witness the rock-er adda, but in the virtual walk, all of these experiences can\u2019t be felt. Many new stories come up out of such interactions. The most crucial aspect is that people won\u2019t be able to feel the pulse of the city. In Calcutta, witnessing that warmth of the people is important. In the near future too it won\u2019t be possible to conduct physical walks. The stories and tales can be shared through virtual walks. So far the response has been great. We conducted FB live sessions too,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are few advantages of the virtual walk as it is open to a huge number of people. They can join by the click of a button. But it depends on how much is being offered to them. I am thinking about how to infuse both virtually \u2014 the facts and the experiences,\u201d says Soham Chakrabarty of Calcutta Capsule. For Ayon and Deep of Walk Calcutta Walk, technical dependence was a problem initially that they are gradually overcoming. \u201cAmphan affected the Internet connection. There are technical issues that we face at times. But even a physical walk has its challenges. People arrive late, places don\u2019t open on some days. So, now we are facing new kinds of challenges. Virtually people are not being able to feel things. The real fun is definitely on the road, but we don\u2019t know when we will be able to hit the roads again. Until then, this is the way forward for us,\u201d say the founders. Subhra Kanti Chatterjee, who is presently on a career break, said: \u201cI have often participated in WCW\u2019s walks with friends and colleagues. One of my friends from outside Calcutta came to visit the city and was very interested to know about it, but unfortunately because of the pandemic he couldn\u2019t go out. He  is very keen to go out whenever they host their next physical walk. I liked the group\u2019s virtual Felu live session very much.\u201d Kajori Ray, an IT consultant and a WCW tour loyalist, specially recalled the taste of an authentic Parsi lunch that was a part of one of the walks. \u201cWe interacted with the Parsi people too. I have not been able to attend any virtual walks till now, but I am looking forward to it.\u201d Virtual is surely the #newnormal, connecting people worldwide, allowing us to experience life differently and from the safety of the four walls of our rooms. It is perhaps only wise to take a shot rather than sit back and sulk, and keep seeing your travel bucket list get longer! : The walks on this page are on diverse subjects like road names, history, or a stroll along the seafront, and are all centred around the resort town of England\u2019s Great Yarmouth. : The historic township nestled in the valley of the Victorian Alps in Australia can be explored virtually on its community page. What is interesting is along with the tour guide, a dog named Tilly accompanies you on the virtual tour across the township. : On this page, you can participate in virtual walks of various Indian cities like Delhi and Varanasi.  This page gives access to historical walks around various places in England like Winchelsea, Rye, Hastings Castle. The page conducts different kinds of walks like castle walks, pub walks among many others.  From Japan to Paris, from Scottish highlands to the Amalfi coast of Italy, this FB page hosts and updates users on various virtual tours around the globe. Happy globetrotting sitting at home!",

        "Article Content": "This was originally one of Sir David Ezra\u2019s (a prominent member of the thriving Jewish community in the 19th century) properties. He had a huge expanse of those and his wife used to stay in this building until it changed hands,\u201d said Raju Bharat, as we sat down for a chat in his office, inside the beautiful heritage block of a property built in 1879 that now calls itself the Kenilworth Hotel. The purpose of our visit to the Little Russel Street address was to get to know more about the hotel that started as a humble inn, and trace its journey of 50 long years through anecdotes shared by the second-generation owner of the family-owned hotel business. It was Raju Bharat\u2019s father M.S. Bharat, who came to Calcutta with the hope of a new beginning after having served in Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose\u2019s Indian National Army (INA). \u201cIt was that period in history when there was the Partition. My late parents were living in Hyderabad, Sindh. When we were evicted from our land, he decided to come to Calcutta where his brother already was. The INA too, had disbanded. And at that time Calcutta was a thriving, flourishing city,\u201d said Bharat. M.S Bharat bought the property where Kenilworth stands today, from an Armenian couple, the Madaths, in 1969. The property had two buildings and one of the two \u2014 the heritage building \u2014 stands the way it did even today. \u201cBack in 1969, one had to bring their own towel and soaps. I remember seeing this when I was all of eight because that\u2019s when I started coming here. My earliest memory is that we had a lot of foreigners staying and a lot of long-stayers. The whole presentation was very limited. Limited breakfast, no room service, rooms were basic and tariffs were reasonable. A room would cost Rs 50 and would come with a bed, cupboard and fixed meals. There was only one dining room with no chefs but old-school cooks. After we shut our gates by 8.30 in the evening, I remember my father sitting with the guests. They would have a drink or play cards together. It was like a small family,\u201d added Bharat. The hotel went through a considerable number of changes in the 1970s when the market started expanding, bringing in more opportunities and traffic into the city. It was in 1984 that redevelopment reached completion and the result was a 100-room block. Bharat, who found his calling early on in life, would help his father at the hotel, be it in the kitchen or as the telephone operator after school. \u201cUltimately, when I went to the hotel school in Switzerland and worked in a five-star hotel in Zurich, I had had 10 years of hands-on, practical experience!\u201d smiled the MD of the Kenilworth Group of Hotels. With a clear idea of the hotel\u2019s positioning and using that knowledge to its strength, Kenilworth Hotel managed to create a whole new category as well as new verticals that focused on F&B. \u201cMy father used to say in his own way \u2014 four-star property but five-star value. We were a four-star hotel but the facilities we were providing were at par with the five-stars. That was our USP and that was something that took the market by storm. There were hardly any good quality hotels in our category so that was the market we captured. My father created F&B outlets and back then those were limited to certain areas. He started a very successful eatery called the Marble Room and a bar called the Mikado. These were success stories because it was like a new path that was being charted. We started changing rapidly because by then outsiders had started coming in and the footfalls had increased. The hotel was so popular that people like Jyoti Basu used to come in during the afternoons,\u201d said Bharat. Steeped in history and charm, the Kenilworth Hotel still stands on its 1.1acre plot. It is also the place that Bharat, his wife and children call home. While Bharat\u2019s wife Anjana is hands-on with the functioning of the hotel, third generation of the Bharat family too, seems to take an interest in the family business. \u201cI try to interact with at least 10 per cent of the guests every day. I remember there was this one guest who had given me a very interesting feedback. She had told me that when you shut the door in the room, it makes a sound which was a disturbing sound. There\u2019s a simple technology that we use in which you basically use a kind of a pad in the door, which acts like a buffer between the door and the frame and prevents any sound. It\u2019s a small thing but because that guest had complained about it, we implemented that immediately and the guest was so happy. It was implemented in all the rooms and that must have satisfied many other guests. It ultimately comes down to knowing the guest and personalising the entire experience,\u201d said Bharat, with a smile as he narrated the incident. While staying relevant after 50 years of operation might seem difficult, Bharat believes it\u2019s constant upgradation that takes care of that problem. \u201cWe continuously plough a lot of our profits back to renovating and that\u2019s why we are relevant too. In today\u2019s new age you constantly need to upgrade and we do it every year. We launched the Premier Club in the heritage wing\u2026,\u201d said Bharat. The Kenilworth brand might be looking at taking their beautiful property in Goa a notch higher besides venturing further in the west of the country and renovating The Big Ben, but one thing that remains constant on their agenda is their concept of hospitality with a personal, homely touch. \u201cMy father would always tell me that treat your guests just the way you would like to be treated and we follow exactly that,\u201d said Bharat as we all got up for a tour of the property. 1. The first F&B outlet in the hotel was a bar named Mikado, which was followed by Marble Room. Then came R.B\u2019s Cafeteria in the late 1980s. Marble Room was then recreated, while in place of Mikado, Alcove, a bigger bar,  came up. There was an open-air garden restaurant called Maikhana, a first of its kind in Calcutta. Subsequently, The Big Ben came up followed by Aromas, the coffee shop, and Mae Kong. This image is of the Marble Room from the \u201970s. 2. From a handful of 15, the staff strength today stands at 220. Most of the current staff or their family members have been a part of the hotel\u2019s 50-year journey. 3. A Premier Club room in the heritage wing of the hotel, which is over hundred years old. What used to be a 35-room hotel has a total of 101 rooms today, with seven suites. 4. Apparently, when M.F. Hussain stayed at the hotel for a month, no one was allowed to go inside his room. Even Satyajit Ray had a particular room where he would usually stay in. (In pic) M.F. Hussain\u2019s paintings at the hotel. 5. Lobster Thermidore, Fish Kenilworth and Baked Alaska are some of the old favourites available at the hotel, which still follow the original recipes.

        "Article Content": "The setting of this story is Lalbagh, a locality in Murshidabad, erstwhile capital of Subah Bengal or present-day Bangladesh, Bengal, Bihar and Odisha. According to the book   (1704-1904), \u201cBeing more conveniently situated than Dacca for the collection of revenue and the supervision of trade... Murshed Kuli Khan, the Great Dewan of Bengal, selected it as his headquarters and embellished it, giving it its present name after his own.\u201d This was in the early 1700s. Thirty kilometres away from Lalbagh is Plassey, and Calcutta is 200 kilometres away. The nawab\u2019s estate here has an enormous entrance; it was designed such that stately elephants could saunter through. To its left there is a two-storey stretch limo of a building punctured with countless square windows. \u201cIt is the house of the Bade Nawab and the Chhote Nawab,\u201d says local guide Swapan Chowdhury. Yes, the Government of India abolished the princely order in 1971, which means titles are not recognised; but the usage endures in various orbits of society to suggest legacy, status or power, oftentimes as veneer on a less grand present.   The two \u201cnawabs\u201d are among the living descendants \u2014 eighth generation to be specific \u2014 of Syed Mir Jafar Ali Khan Bahadur, commander of the Bengal army under Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah. He whom we today know as Mir Jafar, shorn of all gallantry, accomplishments and grandeur he might have been associated with once. The same who is synonymous with the betrayal he perpetrated on the young Siraj in Plassey in 1757.   And so you have \u2014 mir jafar (n) once man, now pejorative; most commonly used Indianism for traitor or turncoat. *** Syed Mohammad Reza Ali Meerza or Chhote Nawab greets me as he hurriedly picks a white kurta from the clothesline and slips it over his head. \u201cThis is the building that housed the sentries during Mir Jafar\u2019s time,\u201d says the 79-year-old. Reza Ali has worked as a state government employee all his life. \u201cMy tenure as a permanent employee fell short by a few days and that\u2019s why I do not get any pension, etc.,\u201d he lets slip a crib and thereafter quickly arranges some plastic chairs, and with a wave of his hand and a \u201c \u201d continues his narration. Pointing to the recently installed statue of Siraj ud-Daulah bang opposite his house he says, \u201cSiraj  \u2026 I love Siraj very much. People say Mir Jafar betrayed him.   that\u2019s wrong.\u201d And yet from what he says, it is clear this is one \u201cwrong\u201d he and his kin have trouble living down even today. Tourists, visitors, researchers, all continue to raise eyebrows when they learn about the family tree. What about locals? He replies, \u201cOh! People here love me. They say: \u2018We do not care about Mir Jafar. We know you are a good human being\u2019.\u201d He offers a quick tour of the andarmahal. There are pictures and memorabilia aplenty littered all over. Is any of this Mir Jafar\u2019s? No. Most of the belongings of the nawabs are kept in the museum inside Hazarduari Palace. That collection includes Mir Jafar\u2019s sword, shield and dagger, his footwear, the cutlery he used. The Hazarduari Palace, Wasif Manzil, and Begum Manzil are all part of the nawab\u2019s estate. Reza Ali offers to take us around. On our way out, we meet Syed Mohammed Abbas Ali Meerza, or Bade Nawab. Abbas Ali has a persona quite distinct from his younger brother\u2019s. He is of reserved bearing and stands on ceremony. He is quick to inform that, in 2013, he won \u201cthe case\u201d in the Supreme Court and since then he and his brother have been recognised as genuine claimants to the title of the Nawab of Murshidabad. Without the prodding, Abbas Ali starts talking about his ancestor. \u201cWho says Mir Jafar was a traitor? Mir Jafar hails from the Najafi dynasty. We are the direct descendants of Prophet Hazrat Mohammad.\u201d The Najafi dynasty was born when the Prophet\u2019s grandchildren Hasan and Husyain\u2019s children married. Abbas Ali explains, \u201cHasan\u2019s son Hassan e Mussanah and Husyain\u2019s daughter Hazrat Fatimah Sughra married. And then the Najafi dynasty was born. We are the descendants of Husyain Najafi. His son Ahmad Najafi was married to Zinnat-un-Nissa, daughter of Shah Jahan\u2019s son Dara Shikoh. Mir Jafar was their son.\u201d He adds, \u201cMir Jafar was much higher in status to Siraj ud-Daulah, both by bloodline and given that he was the son-in-law of Alivardi Khan, the nawab of Bengal and grandfather of Siraj.\u201d Says Abbas Ali, \u201cHad he wan-ted to kill Siraj, he wouldn\u2019t have had to go through all the drama of Plassey. He could have got the musnud (throne) from the Mughal emperor himself.\u201d Dr S.M. Reza Ali Khan is another descendant of Mir Jafar.   had interviewed him in January 2020; months later he died. Khan was a professor of history and had done a lot of research on the Battle of Plassey and Mir Jafar. He had said over phone from Hyderabad, \u201cThe ignominy attached to this name does not give us a good feeling.\u201d Dr Khan believed it is not quite right to judge Mir Jafar by cutting him away from the age he belonged to, the environment and those circumstances. He had said, \u201cIt was the 18th century and there was no concept of nationalism. And even if there was, let me tell you Siraj was not a great nationalist either. Besides, he had killed his own brother, his uncle and even the husband of Alivardi Khan\u2019s eldest daughter, Ghaseti Begum, to get the musnud.\u201d Through the lockdown Dr Khan would call many a time with this reference and that reference from history texts. He spoke about the Sheths of Murshidabad, a very powerful community in the 18th century. They did business with French and British traders. Jagat Sheth Mehtab Chand, one of the most prominent businessmen of Murshidabad, used to lend money to the British at a steep interest. Dr Khan had said, \u201cWhen Siraj declared the British as his enemy, Mehtab Chand could not have been very pleased. His business would have been hampered.\u201d It seems a fair number of Sheths had stood up against Siraj. Abbas Ali too spoke about Siraj\u2019s unpopularity. Siraj had planned to kidnap the daughter of Rani Bhabani, the queen of Nator. \u201cThis was not well received by the Hindu nobility... Siraj had insulted Mir Jafar once in the durbar by having his beard shaved off.\u201d Octogenarian Baquir Ali Meerza is yet another descendant; he too is based in Lalbagh, but in Kella Nizamat. He says, \u201cIt is true we have to suffer the ire of people because the history books say Mir Jafar did not fight in the Battle of Plassey. But these books do not say why he did not fight.\u201d In  , Partha Chatterjee cites from the Fort William Select Committee Proceedings of May 1, 1757. It reads, \u201cThe Committee then took into consideration, whether they could (consistently with the Peace made with the Nabob) concur in the measures proposed by Meer Jaffir of taking the Government from Souragud Dowla, and setting himself up...\u201d Sometime end-June, the British won Plassey. In the same book, Chatterjee writes, \u201cThe battle was over by the fall of dusk. The next day, Clive wrote to Mir Jafar: \u2018I congratulate you on the victory, which is yours not mine...\u2019\u201d Baquir Ali\u2019s version differs. He says, \u201cMir Jafar\u2019s tent was closest to the British forces. The British had come to fight the French, not Siraj ud-Daulah. Armed with only 2,000 soldiers, they came to Plassey and found that Siraj was waiting there with an army of 20,000. The French army stood in front of Siraj\u2019s camp. Mir Jafar\u2019s camp was far away.\u201d According to him, the British approached Mir Jafar and asked him to mediate with the nawab. Mir Jafar sent a messenger to Siraj but it would have taken a day to cover the distance. In the meantime, the French army opened fire. The British mistook it as Siraj\u2019s rejection of their proposal and retaliated. \u201cMir Jafar was confused and did not know what to do... What happened at the battlefield of Plassey is a case of misunderstanding and not betrayal,\u201d says Baquir Ali.  asked Abu Taher Khan, the Trinamul MP from Murshidabad, his views on Mir Jafar. A guarded Khan replied, \u201cIn this atmosphere it is best I don\u2019t comment on Mir Jafar... But it was because of Mir Jafar that our country lost its independence. Many people say, \u2018These people come from the land of Mir Jafar\u2019. Anyone can understand in what context it is being said.\u201d   *** On my way back from Murshidabad, I make two more stops \u2014 Mir Jafar\u2019s palace and his tomb. As it turns out, there is no trace of the palace, only remains of what used to be its gates. The place is still referred to as  or traitor\u2019s gate. The Jafarganj cemetery that houses the tomb is also closed that day. The auto-rickshaw driver who has driven me around says, \u201cEarlier it was always open, but then tourists would come and spit on it, kick it. That is when the local administration had it walled; a gate was installed.\u201d Locked too behind that gate are the graves of Heera and Panna, actors of the era\u2019s dubious games of estate and empire. Falcons both, Heera and Panna flew spying sorties for the house of Mir Jafar \u2014 to the Siraj camp or, some say, to the British battlements, who knows? They were both killed in the line of duty, shot out of the skies \u2014 some say by Siraj\u2019s marksmen, others that it was actually the British, who knows? Both were dear enough to be accorded resting places at the back of where Mir Jafar lies \u2014 to that there is sacrophagal evidence. The rest is contrary apocrypha, pick your version. That\u2019s often the case with history too, narratives compete, interpretations duel. I remembered what Abbas Ali had told me, \u201cThe British wrote our history. What I don\u2019t understand is why the nawabs after Mir Jafar did not take it upon themselves to put out their version. If only...,\u201d his voice had trailed off. Mir Jafar had three wives : Fatima Begum and Mir Miran Mir\u2019s son is Murtaza Khan Murtaza\u2019s son is Mustafa Khan Mustafa\u2019s son is Asadullah Khan Asadullah\u2019s son is Azam Ali Khan Azam\u2019s son is Faiyaz Ali Khan Faiyaz\u2019s son is Jafar Ali Khan Jafar\u2019s son is *Dr S.M.

        "Article Content": "Pre-pandemic. The heritage industry of Calcutta was booming. Yes, the heritage industry. A little more than 200 guided tours \u2014 walking tours, cultural tours, archaeological tours, food tours, photography tours \u2014 run by individuals, community groups, private companies and institutions. Hooghly\u2019s Flower Fest tour by Calcutta Photo Tours; Confluence of Cultures \u2014 Bow Barracks to Burrabazar walk by Calcutta Walks; Cruise into the Past: A Morning Heritage Cruise by the Heritage Walk Calcutta; Cycle the Kolkata Wetlands and Amazing Views by Shirish Poddar; Slum Walking Tour by Let\u2019s Meet Up Tours; Walking With Ghosts (a midnight tour) by Anthony Khatchaturian; a two-hour traditional Bengali meal in a private Calcutta home by Travelling Spoon; The Dying Ghats walk; South Park Street Cemetery walk; Ramzan food walk\u2026 Walks and tours are used interchangeably, but the thing to remember is that while all walks are tours, all tours are not walks. In any case, these things, mostly ticketed and ranging from Rs 150 to Rs 5,000, turned focus on 30-plus neighbourhoods. Chitpur, Strand Road, Kidderpore, Metiabruz, Tiretti Bazar, Shyambazar, Park Street, Dalhousie... They told the stories of at least 15 communities \u2014 Anglo-Indians, Jews, Parsis, Chinese, Marwaris, Armenians, Gujaratis, South Indians. Of vanishing textiles \u2014 muslin, khadi. Of traditional art forms such as   stitch,  ,  -making, terracotta, and a rich and mixed culinary heritage. Big, small and nondescript places with historical backstories stirred awake to find themselves buzzing with activity and attention. The 94-year-old Calcutta South India Club now has a coffee shop on its premises, the American online vacation rental company Airbnb acquired some old properties, Victoria Memorial came to host a lit fest, as did Tollygunge Club and St. John\u2019s Anglican Church, the old RBI building in Dalhousie Square turned into a currency museum, and the iconic Old Currency Building got a makeover and was reborn an exhibition hub. Then there were cultural projects, CSR funded-projects and intervention projects funded by cultural organisations. The clientele included tourists \u2014 foreign and domestic \u2014 and locals. The most footfalls were clocked between October and March. In an industry-lean geography, all of this created new job opportunities \u2014 photographers, researchers, bloggers, social media strategists, web designers, videographers, content creators \u2014 and lent relevance to ones that had long passed into the city\u2019s blind spot \u2014 the  , the  , the  . In the 2016 Bengali film Praktan, a Prosenjit-Rituparna starrer, the protagonist was someone who conducted heritage walks. In the 2018 thriller  , the hero was heritage. To borrow one more time from the movies, Calcutta\u2019s   now seemed to hinge on its  , or past. Calcutta had the highest growth in foreign tourist arrivals \u2014 13.5 per cent \u2014 among all the metro cities in India between April and December 2019. Entwined as it is with travel and tourism, post the pandemic, the heritage industry screeched to a halt. Says Ramanuj, one of the \u201cexplorers\u201d or guides of Calcutta Walks, \u201cBefore Covid-19 happened, we used to achieve a target of 1,000 walks annually. But  things have changed.\u201d Manjit Singh Hoonjan, who founded the Calcutta Photo Tours nearly a decade ago, predicts a longer pause than the other industries. He retorts, \u201cIf it were virtually possible, do you think people would travel for so many hours, endure multiple flights and layovers? Mohua Shome Lalvani was conducting walks in the city long before they were the \u201cit\u201d thing. Mohua\u2019s walks were peregrinations. She says, \u201cWe were doing it for ourselves. Just out of curiosity and to know our city better.\u201d There was no fee attached. But around the same time, Iftekhar Ahsan launched Calcutta Walks and it was quite the opposite. Iftekhar tells  , \u201cA decade ago, online travel portals did not have a category titled \u2018walks\u2019 for Calcutta. We were clubbed under hotels.\u201d He started with the Dalhousie Square walk. And today, the scroll-down menu of the Calcutta Walks site offers six modes, nine themes, and one heritage stay. Client testimonials are datelined Connecticut, Dubai, the UK, Netherlands, Chicago, Bangladesh, Paris, Berlin. \u201cThey want to see India outside Taj Mahal, Varanasi, Wagah Border,\u201d says Ramanuj. \u201cWhen they do a culinary walk they really want to see the making of the   kebab roll at Nizam\u2019s. They want to understand how Bengali food is served course by course. They really want to know stories about places, stories that are not available on Google. I take them to Nimtala Ghat near Bhoothnath to have   and  . They want to shop for   (traditional bangles and markers of a married woman in Bengal). Sometimes I have arranged sari-wearing sessions for them,\u201d he adds. \u201cFor us, international clients are important. It is the constant funding we need to survive,\u201d says Iftekhar. Speaking of survival, as the heritage industry continued to experiment and expand, green shoots raised their heads. Of course, not everything produced direct economic benefits. For instance, for the last 60 years on Sunday mornings the Chinese community of Tiretti Bazar in central Calcutta puts out a breakfast spread for anyone who cares to stop by. In 2016, The Community Art Project (TCAP) entered the scene and it highlighted the story of the Indian Chinese community. Says Swati Mishra of TCAP, \u201cPeople started taking ownership of their public spaces\u2026 We had people from the community coming up to conduct art workshops, food pop-ups and even a heritage walk.\u201d Atreyee Basak and Poulomee Auddy are founders of The Ganges Walk \u2013 Rediscovering Calcutta. Since 2018, they have been doing walks and one such is exploring the Dying Ghats Walk, a three-hour affair beginning at Armenian Ghat and ending at Nimtala. It focuses on the tales of ghats or riverfronts. Atreyee says many students of history and architecture are now keen to be a part of the heritage industry. Says Poulomee, \u201cThey approach us for internships\u2026 We are here to give back to the city the essence with which it was carved into being.\u201d Sumona Chakravarty, founder of Hamdasti, a community-based arts organisation, says, \u201cThere are lots of artists who are a part of this (heritage churn). They may not be directly employed, but given the lack of institutional spaces for supporting art, they have found these abandoned buildings and reinvented them as artist-run and pop-up spaces.\u201d Chelsea McGill and Tathagata Neogi founded the Heritage Walk Calcutta in 2017 \u2014 it has since been renamed Immersive Trails. Chelsea says, \u201cWe wanted our venture to be a self-sustaining social enterprise... This was why we chose to start as a for-profit enterprise. A non-profit model would have to depend on donations and external sources of funding often with riders... But as a private limited company we generate funds ourselves. We then invest the money back in researching and creating new experiences as well as building a robust team of experts and interns.\u201d \nJayanta Sengupta, secretary and curator of Victoria Memorial Hall (VMH), calls this phenomenon \u201ca fortuitous convergence of new interests and avenues related to heritage\u201d. Victoria Memorial was possibly never lacking in footfall and attention, but now, to use Sengupta\u2019s words, they tried to \u201creinvent VMH as a safe, inclusive, pluralist-in-spirit space for a wide range of conversations\u201d. He adds, \u201cIt\u2019s an advantage to have spaces that lend grandeur (front steps) as well as intimacy for smaller conversations or concerts (the colonnaded quadrangles on the sides).\u201d The events hosted at VMH showcased not just its own grandeur but the grandeur of Calcutta and by extension of Bengal. G.M. Kapur of Intach talks about how riding the heritage surge people from Krishnagar, Murshidabad started contacting him for advice on monetising heritage properties. It seems even tea estates had started to use a colonial bungalow or two for homestays. Says Swati, \u201cThis is the best thing to come out of it all. Heritage and culture are no longer limited to the elite galleries but are there in the public spaces for everyone to access. This is how it should be, beneficial both ways.\u201d Shalini Bansal is one of the co-founders of HopOn India, an app-based audio-guided tour. They had launched three Calcutta walks in 2018 \u2014 Pathuriaghata \u2013 Finding the Tagores, Calcutta Sports Walk \u2013 The Fabled Maidan and the Dalhousie or BBD Bag Walking Tour. Shalini admits, \u201cThe industry is suffering like never before.\u201d Sengupta of VMH says, \u201cWe, as a government institution, are insulated from layoffs and furloughs, but there are many heritage institutions that are struggling.\u201d Shalini, however, balances this with talk of the advantages of a \u201cdigital product\u201d. Indeed, most heritage outfits have started virtual walks, diversified into talks, 3D tours, exhibitions. HWC is one of them. It seems for the first 50 days of the lockdown, they did a daily trivia on their social media pages. They also conducted capacity building workshops \u2014 all paid \u2014 via video conferencing for \u201cnon-experts who want to learn how to record and understand heritage in their own surroundings\u201d. Shalini believes now people will want to travel to places nearer home much more. Manjit seconds that. Ramanuj says, \u201cWe have started doing some walks since September. We did five walks each in September, October and November. Locals are the audience now. We do walks early in the morning and there are less people and crowds.\u201d But Sengupta provides what is possibly the buzzword, the mantra to rescue the ghost of an industry and nudge it towards a brighter  . \u201cCollaboration,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need more collaboration, more joint programming, more concerted promotion of those aspects of our heritage that are facing a crisis. Our assets and skills are intact, but we need to save the people associated with them.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "Garad, the handwoven red-bordered white silk sari that is emblematic of the Bengali woman, especially if she is doing puja, and korial, garad\u2019s close cousin, come mostly from Murshidabad. They are made from tussar or mulberry silk, which is not dyed so that it retains its natural white/off white colour. White is associated with purity, and red is also an auspicious colour in Bengal, which makes garad or korial the appropriate sari for religious ceremonies, even weddings. A korial banarasi is a coveted wedding sari. On occasions of worship, often the edges of the garad or korial sari are not stitched or a fall is not attached to it, so that the sari remains pure in its original form.   during Durga Puja is not the same without a garad. And now, a lot of Bollywood, too. The Jiaganj-Azimganj area in Murshidabad is the centre of garad and korial sari weaving. The garad sari can come with an intricately woven border and paisleys, butis or floral motifs in the body and larger motifs in the anchal, usually in red or maroon, though other colours are not unheard of.  Korial, too, has a white body and red border, but is more dramatic. It may or may not have patterns in the body and its border is a far richer red. It is called \u201c \u201d, blood red. The number of korial weavers in Murshidabad is very few. Some of them weave a special border: it is equally red both on the outside and inside, \u201c \u201d and \u201c \u201d, as the weavers say. They also complain that weaving a korial is too much work and too little pay. The sari, they say, may not survive. Unless you buy them, and know the fake from the real. For example, what Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Madhuri Dixit were wearing in  , singing  , were just chiffon saris with red borders and shimmery sequins.",

        "Article Content": "At 8 o\u2019clock on a pre-Covid Sunday morning, I walked into the National Library in Alipore in Calcutta. The reading room of the 180-year-old building was open to members although it was a holiday. I walked in, determined to plunge straight into the pages of the books I had left on the rack the day before. Tip tap tip tap... I walked at a leisurely pace, enjoying the sound of my three-inch heels on the wooden floor. Once or twice I thought someone was walking right behind me. But when I turned back, there was no one. As I stood in the middle of the room clutching on to my ration \u2014 three books \u2014 the emptiness of the place seemed formidable. I thought I heard the flutter of wings. Was it a pigeon, I wondered. It was February, but I remember feeling a chill. An odd thought floated into my head \u2014 it was Mir Jaffar who had gifted the 400-bigha Belvedere Estate to Warren Hastings for his support in reinstating him to the musnud of Murshidabad. I pulled my shawl closer and started to read. I walked into the same Belvedere House exactly 20 years later. The hall that used to be the reading room had been turned into an exquisite exhibition space. The old-world bulbs were gone and now chandeliers poured light from above. As I strode on, I waited for the wood to sing out and upon hearing nothing, I looked down and saw the hollow wooden flooring had been replaced with fine tiles. In the background, a recorded voice narrated the heroic exploits of Syama Prasad Mookerjee. Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay, Tagore and Subhas Chandra Bose smiled down from the walls. The change was too much to process at once. My mind kept throwing up images of the reading room from the past. The old room had books everywhere \u2014 on the desk of the librarian, inside the countless cupboards, on the racks... There used to be a long teak table in the centre of the room. Hovering over it were orange lights hanging from thick iron chains that were fixed to the high ceiling. The ceiling was hardly ever visible in the dark, but if you tilted your head and looked up, you could spot the racks laden with books on the first floor of the reading room. Ancient fans slap-banged the air inside the room with their olden blades. On any given day, the reading room would have a dozen members. If I close my eyes, even today I can still see myself in one of the wooden chairs poring over Absalom and Achitophel. My friend is sitting right next to me but I can\u2019t see her in the dim light. I can only hear her pen dragging across paper. . Across the tabIe I can spy two hands arranging and rearranging a bunch of papers. Cluck, cluck, cluck, the hands punch together the pages. Each and every sound, from the turning of pages to the squeak of a chair, would be magnified in this room, making you doubly aware of its vastness. And if someone happened to drop a book, the thump would send the birds in the hidden nooks and corners hither thither, as if rudely awakened from their midday dream. I cannot remember any two people exchanging any two words in this space. And if anyone perchance did, a library staff would appear out of nowhere and bang onto the table a wooden signage which had inscribed on it a single word \u2014 SILENCE. Even the clerk who handled the requisitions was inimical to the spoken word. Always dressed in a white shirt and trousers, wearing thick glasses, he would respond to every query and request with a movement of his brows or hand or narrowing of eyes. A light shone right above his bald head and for some reason he gave me the shivers. The reading room had a spirit of its own. And that spirit was conducive to thought, deep thought. When it magnified innocuous sounds, it actually turned the focus on the ordinary. This was where I could listen away to the monotonous cooing of the cuckoo bird and not be bored. I would watch my mind wander aimlessly, turn to the duel between Hastings and his legal officer Philip Francis on these very grounds \u2014 some say it had to do with the Baroness Inhoff. I would watch mesmerised as complete strangers drowned in the written word. But the wealth of that scope is lost now. In its place stands a slick space, awash with lights and new markers of heritage. As I took my leave that day, I saw a pigeon change perch. Only, I missed the flutter.",

        "Article Content": "The iron safe has weathered but still stands in Shanti Nivas \u2011 a century-old building neatly tucked away in a laneway in Giridih district, Jharkhand, just like the pictures and manuscripts that adorn the walls of the cottage. Shanti Nivas, now christened the J.C. Bose Memorial and Science centre, is where the legendary biophysicist Jagdish Chandra Bose breathed his last in 1937. In the intervening 83 years, little has been done to preserve Bose\u2019s scientific legacy, except for a brief effort made by Bihar governor A. K. Kidwai in 1997 to convert Shanti Nivas into a J.C. Bose Memorial Science Centre. But gradually, it ceased to be functional. A little away from the memorial, there is a girls\u2019 high school named after the scientist, but it was never used to ignite and nurture scientific curiosity in young adults studying a stone's throw away from the centre. New York\u2019s Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers has called J C Bose \u2018Father of Radio Science\u2019 because of contribution in the field of radio technology. But Bose\u2019s contribution is not limited to this segment only. Bose donned many hats. He was not just a botanist, physicist, biologist or an inventor but an author too. He is best known for his interdisciplinary approach of using botany and physics to prove that plants are living beings. He is also credited for inventing the crescograph \u2013 an instrument that measures a plant\u2019s response to any stimuli. The scientist, who taught at the Presidency College, Calcutta and founded the Bose Institute, chose to spend later part of his life in Giridih, Jharkhand. For the uninitiated, the district back then used to be part of the Bengal Presidency. It was here that he died. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of immense pride that Sir J.C. Bose breathed his last in Giridih,\u201d said A.I. Khan, former principal of Giridih College and the president of the Society for Science in Jharkhand, a Jamshedpur-based voluntary organization that works towards promoting scientific communication. \u201cIt was here that he spent the latter part of his life researching. Even today, an iron safe of his lies unattended in the memorial. Former president A. P. J. Kalam was to unlock it. The news just got published, but nothing happened, beyond building up expectation,\u201d Khan said. \u201cIn the late Nineties when his residence was made into a memorial housing a museum, library, and his statue, we thought that it would serve as a place to inspire young minds. But gradually, scientific activities conducted there ceased. Officials of Sarva Siksha Aviyan(SSA), Giridih, use a portion of the memorial as their office. It continues to function from there. But as an educator, my heart weeps when it sees a scientific legacy die before my eyes.\u201d Seeing the historic building erode before their eyes drove civilians to spring into action once again. \u201cWe have sent letters to Jharkhand\u2019s Chief Minister Hemant Soren, deputy commissioner of Giridih, Bose Institute, Calcutta, and even the Prime Minister of India, trying to draw their attention to this legacy that has been lying in shambles,\u201d said D.N.S. Anand, secretary of the Society for Science. Their effort has yielded results. Speaking to  , Sudivya Kumar Sonu, MLA, Giridih said, \u201cSome of the civilians from Giridih have alerted me about the legacy of Sir J. C. Bose lying in shambles. We are in talks with the district administration and even the Bose Institute in Calcutta.\u201d Sonu also mentioned, \u201cCentral Coalfield Limited is volunteering to fund the development work of the science centre. They have dedicated Rs 1,000,000 (10 lakhs) under their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) work for the betterment of the memorial.\u201d However, when asked about SSA officials using the centre as its office, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s good that government officials are using the premise. It is a private building and could have been encroached and violated had the SSA not been using it. But yes, once a system is in place, we can work towards bettering the system.\u201d Meanwhile, Rahul Sinha, DC, Giridih, stated, \u201cWe had written to the Bose Institute, seeking their recommendation and help to make the memorial functional. Following which, we had even sent a team to meet the officials.\u201d Confirming the communication was Prof. Gaurab Gangopadhyay of the Bose Institute, Calcutta. He said, \u201cA team from Giridih had come to meet us. We discussed several things, like how the memorial can be bettered and used to develop the students' scientific interest.\u201d Prof. Gangopadhyay said, \u201cThey are seeking our guidance to develop the memorial into a functional science centre. We will guide their parent organization to better the centre. We will also help them with a blueprint on how the life of the legendary scientist can be put on display at the centre to inspire the young adults. We also open to the idea of conducting scientific events there.\u201d Ritesh Sarak, secretary of the Sir J.C. Bose Memorial Society, and one of the representatives who had traveled to Calcutta for the meeting, said that they are excited about working with the Institute to preserve Bose\u2019s legacy. \u201cWe have already shared the memorial\u2019s layout with the curators and officials of the Institute. They will prepare a blueprint for the restoration of the museum,\u201d he said. He added, \u201cThe institute will be sending some of their representatives to Giridih, sometime soon.\u201d Sarak also mentioned that during his meeting with the officials, he and the society has stressed specifically the preservation of Bose\u2019s iron safe. \u201cWhat it holds is still a mystery. The district administration might not have the power to open we can try to preserve the limited edition of iron safe manufactured during World War I,\u201d he said.",

The name, a bit of a misnomer, and poignantly so, reminds us of the deep connectedness between the two Bengals across the international border. Tangail saris go back to Tangail, a central district in Bangladesh, which is famous for its fine handwoven cotton saris. \u201cOriginally, Tangail was probably an extra warp-bordered, medium-count range (sari) that had a distinctive lata-pata, vine and flower pattern\u2026,\u201d says the Bihar and Bengal volume of the series  , edited by Martand Singh. The Tangail weavers \u2014 many of them have the surname Basak \u2014 were also experts at making Dhakai Jamdanis. After Partition, a large number of the weavers came to India and settled in and around Nadia district. But the craft that they brought with them retained its name, and the Tangail sari began to be made in this Bengal as well, famously. Soon it would outshine the original saris of south Bengal, the Shantipuri from Nadia and the Dhonekhali from Hooghly, in popularity and variety. Phulia in Shantipur is one of the major centres of Tangail sari production, the reason why Tangail and Phulia saris are used interchangeably.   Today, the Tangail is also the sari that is seeing a lot of experimentation, following the recent handloom boom, in terms of fabric design, patterns and colours. A surprising fact, says the   volume, is that the Tangail here did not replicate the Tangail from East Bengal, \u201cbut is a hybrid\u201d. \u201cAt some places it is a simplistic imitation of the Jamdani, with extra-weft patterning after every alternate pick. At others, this is combined with extra-warp border patterning perhaps derived from Tangail and Shantipur,\u201d the book adds. Sounds a bit like the complex patterns of Bengal\u2019s history, hybrid and full of borders.",

        "Article Content": "Once upon a time there was an urban legend about a  guarding our skies.   is the Bengali word for black and   means fairy. And that is how the finial atop the central dome of Calcutta\u2019s Victoria Memorial fluttered its way into my imagination all those years ago. Fantastic and female. I had no idea who created it and why, and I dare say I was most likely not in the minority. Truth is, in post-Independence India, the colonial context of the memorial had gotten blurred. For long years, before it turned platform to lit fests, talks and a much-talked about political soiree, the memorial\u2019s overwhelming identity was that it was a safe haven for the city\u2019s lovers. As for the , it is difficult to say what one and all made of it. What is certain is that the interest in this exotic weathervane and lightning conductor never waned. The media cottoned on to this, and every year or so there was a report on the mechanics of it \u2014 if only to say now it is turning, now it is not and now it is about to. I got curious about the   genesis some years ago but couldn\u2019t go beyond a name here, a detail there. Aiding my query, a friend forwarded me a note from the British scholar Rosie Llewellyn-Jones. It came with a photograph of the pori as a work in progress. There she was, mouth on a trumpet held up lightly but resolutely, a wreath in another hand, robes clinging to a full figure, mighty wings waiting for the right backdrop to come alive, a foot on a dome and a human figure bent over it. Llewellyn-Jones wrote, \u201c\u2026it doesn\u2019t give the name of the chap who\u2019s actually doing the work.\u201d My search would have moved no further, but then came the   centenary year and just like that the wind changed. When Queen Victoria died in 1901, Lord Curzon was the Viceroy of India. He announced his plan to build a memorial to his monarch. The man who hastily sliced and diced Bengal did not rush with his dream project. Between 1905 and 1909 no actual work of construction was done. Instead, William Emerson and his team of architects and draughtsmen perfected the plan. Victoria was the name of the British queen, it was also the name of the Roman goddess of victory. The figure of Victory was a common representation in Roman monuments and coins. In early Christian art, the winged angel replaced the winged Victory. The   was meant to represent the Angel of Victory. \u201cBritish imperialists imagined themselves to be Roman, hence the borrowed symbolism,\u201d said Jayanta Sengupta who is secretary and curator of Victoria Memorial Hall. Most people credited a sculptor from Cheltenham town in England\u2019s Gloucestershire with the creation of the angel. I got in touch with the Cheltenham Library and received two scanned news pages. The first was from   dated February 1921. The entry headlined \u201cCalcutta Queen Victoria Memorial\u201d read, \u201cCheltonians... will be interested to know the large part played by a local firm in the art work.\u201d The angel had been model-led and cast in bronze by H.H. Martyn and Co. Ltd. The second page, also from   but dated June 1926, carried an obituary of a Robert Lindsey Clark who had been head sculptor and art director at H.H. Martyn. It said on behalf of the firm that he had worked on portions of the Calcutta memorial. The Gloucestershire County Council shared with me an advertisement of H.H. Martyn from the 1920s; the 16-foot bronze angel was the lead visual and clearly its USP. But there was no mention of Clark on the flier; instead, it read \u2014 \u201cArchitect: Vincent J. Esch\u201d. I wrote to the Cheltenham Local History Society hoping to get more details about the brief to Clark, perhaps his jottings. Jill Waller replied saying, \u201cSadly almost all the records of H.H. Martyn & Co. were destroyed, firstly by a bomb in World War II, and then when the works closed in the 1970s.\u201d But I could refer to a book on the firm written by a great grandson of the founder. by John Whitaker confirmed that Clark had designed the angel, though his most famed work was not this but a bronze sculpture called The Broken Limber. An Italian, George Mancini, had apparently cast the angel into bronze. Clark had been a member of the Royal Society of British Sculptors. When I wrote to them, Elle Arscott replied saying she doubted if George Mancini had been involved in the angel\u2019s making as, according to the records, he did not set up his own foundry until the early 1930s. Later, Suzanne Lindsey Clark, daughter-in-law of Clark\u2019s grandson Michael, told me, \u201cIt was actually George\u2019s father Frederick Sr who created the bronze.\u201d H.H. Martyn engaged the Mancini family to work in the foundry \u201cbecause of their special skills in the lost wax process; making the mould in plaster with a thickness of wax between the mould and the core\u201d. In yet another email, Suzanne wrote, \u201cI have attached a portrait photo of Robert as well as photos of the designing and making of the angel...\u201d And there it was, the exact same puzzle piece photo with which I had embarked on this   chase. Other gaps filled up. Sengupta had shown me a photograph of the memorial dated July 5, 1921, and missing the pori. And yet it was very much there in the photographs from the inauguration in December 1921. But Arscott had said the angel was shipped from Cheltenham to Calcutta in 1920. This meant that though the angel was in the city, it assumed its perch sometime between July and December 1921.   I would have stopped here, except that I found this nugget in one of the archival gems shared by Waller. A page of the British weekly   dated November 1920. Report 1 titled \u201cSome Problems of the East\u201d was about how despite her problems, India had much to offer \u201cin the way of artistry\u201d. There was a reference to the (1920) by Lieutenant-Colonel F.B. Bradley-Brit, which Abanindranath Tagore had apparently illustrated \u201cwith most delicious charm\u201d. Report 2 was an update on Victoria Memorial. Not caring for editorial logic, the olden page designer had stuck a photograph of the Angel of Victory in the middle of Piece 1. On a whim \u2014 or was it a nudge? \u2014 I looked up the Bradley-Birt book and there it was, a wondrous illustration by Abanindranath. The full-page watercolour showed a charcoal horizon of the texture of dreams, soft with billowing clouds, a paper-white moon and side-profiles of two maidens dark of skin. It was captioned \u201cKala Paree and Nidra Paree (sic).\u201d Fairies have their ways, they work by suggestion.",

        "Article Content": "When a city grows, its denizens seldom have reason to cheer. Because cities seldom grow. Leaning on actual and amplified demand, cheered on by corporators, administrators and ambassadors, cities overvault into an ambitious space sans planning and checks. \u201cCalcutta grew by chance,\u201d says Nilangshu Bhusan Basu, who is a retired principal chief engineer of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). When the British took over governance of the city in the late 19th century, its population was 2,00,000 and its total area 50 square kilometres. More than 150 years on, the city has grown four times in size. It houses 44,96,694, according to the 2011 census and there are another six million who float in and out every day. Calcutta\u2019s population density is 24,000 per square kilometre. In developed countries there are no more than 4,000 people living in a square kilometre. It has not grown much in the north. Old Calcutta with its narrow alleys had developed around hosiery factories. \u201cThe alleys here were built by the British to resist hand-to-hand combat which was the norm those days. Two people could not walk side by side. To build anything new here or to widen roads, large sections have to be razed to the ground,\u201d says Pradip Chakraborty, who is a retired town planner of KEIIP (Kolkata Environmental Improvement Investment Programme). To the west flows River Hooghly, so no expansion is possible there either. The city has expanded eastwards \u2014 the wetlands there have been largely filled up. A portion of east Calcutta \u2014 Salt Lake \u2014 encroaches into the erstwhile Sunderbans. All of this means the major expansion has happened southwards.Says Basu, \u201cThree hundred years ago, south Calcutta had grown with the temple at Kalighat as the nucleus. Those days, what is now known as Rashbehari Avenue used to be considered the southern end of the city. But now, south Calcutta ends where Diamond Harbour Road begins, in the southwest.\u201d Joka and Behala are part of CMC. Greater Calcutta or Calcutta Metropolitan Area covers an even larger area, four municipal corporations and 37 municipality.The planned and organic growth of a city hinges on its network of roads and pipelines \u2014 drinking water as well as sewerage lines \u2014 which has to be in sync with the number of people who would be using these. The British had an idea that the city would grow rapidly in the years to come and had accordingly constructed 180 kilometres of sewerage line. To date, north Calcutta has the most well-planned road network. The number of vehicles has gone up 10 times since Independence but the roads can still handle the traffic load. Jaydeep Mukherjee, another senior architect and urban designer, talks about how the British had followed an axis while constructing roads. \u201cThey planned them like a spine with branches running left and right. This is why the roads can bear the increased load.\u201d Post-1947, there has been no major planned infrastructural development. \u201cNo new sewerage lines were laid except on ad hoc basis, and that too without proper documentation,\u201d says Basu. Waves of migration continued. Behala, where Partition refugees settled, did not have any sewerage lines to begin with. Ditto Garden Reach. Picnic Garden. Tiljala-Topsia. Jadavpur. Santoshpur. Mukundapur. Garia. Sonarpur. \u201cHere, too, people settled down but there was no infrastructure to support this influx. Makeshift houses with tin roofs came up indiscriminately,\u201d says Basu. All of the South 24-Parganas and parts of North 24-Parganas grew unplanned, unchecked, unsupervised. More people also means more consumption and more waste produced. During Basu\u2019s tenure at CMC, from 1981 to 2019, only 26.5 kilometres of man-entry sewer lines and 15 kilometres of non-man-entry lines had been cleaned and refurbished. \u201cThey were full of debris, construction waste and solid waste. There are telecom cables blocking the cross section of sewerage lines! There are electric cables too.\u201d Result? Impeded water flow. Impossible repair work. And at the end of it all, yearly waterlogging. As for drinking water, even now many pockets don\u2019t have piped water supply. More people also means more vehicles, more traffic. Successive governments did not hesitate to make new roads. More bridges were added; flyovers started to come up. Today, there are 20-plus bridges in the city, 10 rail overbridges and 16 flyovers. These bridges and flyovers have come to be the habitat of the city\u2019s labour force. They are the new slums. Says Chakraborty, \u201cI have even come across spaces rented out on a shift basis to migrant labourers.\u201d As the city spread, parts of it choked. \u201cThirty three per cent of the wetlands are gone,\u201d says Chakraborty. He adds, \u201cThe city has also lost its hogla vegetation, which was the natural water purifier.\u201d But the city has not stopped growing, not for anything. A lot of this growth is vertical. The tallest buildings have 65-75 floors. Laws have been tweaked to accommodate them. And, as Mukherjee says, tall buildings mean that much more depletion of groundwater. Speaking of water, the 2006 city road directory lists 61 roads named after ponds \u2014 Manoharpukur, Ahiripukur, Bosepukur, Padmapukur, Muraripukur, Beniapukur... College Square was previously known as Gol Dighi. Writers\u2019 Buildings overlooks Lal Dighi, which was once the only source of drinking water in all of Calcutta. A 2016 report shows that the city has lost 46 per cent of its water bodies to landfills.   Overweight and still putting on, how will the city breathe and live? Says Basu, \u201cLook at Dhapa, it is the largest dumping ground here. There are two others \u2014 one in Garden Reach and another in Noapara. All full to the brim and rising higher and higher.\u201d But there is no alternative ground to dump the waste onto. Chakraborty adds, \u201cHow can we say that Calcutta can be turned into London when there is indiscriminate landfilling, daily passengers flooding the city, labour force moving out of the city and the state in search of work, slums so full that rooms are rented being out, no new industry, no revamping of existing industries, lost heritage... Lights alone do not make a city shine.\u201d But while unveiling the party manifesto last month, the TMC\u2019s Partha Chatterjee said, \u201cMamata Banerjee promised to turn Calcutta into \u2018Tilottoma\u2019 and now we are promising to make it more \u2018Tilottoma\u2019.\u201d   ",

        "Article Content": "Only 260 years ago I was part of Gobindopur, a village interspersed with forested marshland by the Hooghly river . It was one of the three villages founded as Calcutta \u2014 the trading port of the East India Company \u2014 by a sahib called Job Charnock, in 1690. Gobindopur was the smallest \u2014 just 1,044 bighas, 13.5 cottahs \u2014 of the three, extending from Kolikata Khal (creek) in the north to Gobindopur Nullah (or Tolly Nullah) in the south. The creek originated from the salt lakes in the east and \u201cdebouched\u201d into the Hooghly at present-day Prinsep Ghat, flowing through Beliaghata, Sealdah, Chandni Chowk and Hastings Street. The jungle was thick and full of wild boars, jackals and tigers. Warren Hastings, then just an official (later governor general of the company), shot a tiger in the southeast corner where St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral now stands. When Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah visited Calcutta, he set up a hunting lodge in the area where the Victoria Memorial Hall was later built; for some years the Presidency Jail was here. There were patches of arable land growing tobacco, paddy and cotton.   Some historians claim I owe my origin to Siraj ud-Daulah. After all, it was his attack on Calcutta that forced the East India Company to build a new and stronger fort on my precincts. The other Fort William, further north by the river, had been captured by him in 1756. After the company defeated the nawab and recaptured Calcutta, Lord Clive, the governor of Bengal Presidency, decided to demolish the old fort and build a new one, with an unobstructed field for firing. In August 1757, permission was issued to fell all trees for a clear field. Clive commissioned Captain John Brohier as the chief engineer to build a strong fort capable of accommodating a garrison of 5,000. The estimated cost was Rs 19,11,569. Brohier started work towards the end of October 1757 but it got delayed. First, due to a dearth of labourers and erosion of the Hooghly. Then came the great famine of 1770. The fort was finally completed in 1773. The octagonal fort has five sides facing me and three facing the river, surrounded by a dry ditch that could be flooded by raising a sluice from the Hooghly. In the early days, there were drawbridges to cross the moat but they were abandoned later. The fort and the clearing that was yours truly displaced hundreds of natives \u2014 weavers, fishermen, farmers, artisans, traders. The British claimed they had compensated with \u201cmoney and grants of land\u201d. The entire colony with their deity Gobinda Jiu and its historic shrine migrated to the north of Calcutta. The sahibs loved my verdant greens that reminded them of Hyde Park back home in England. They planted trees, tended the grass, went for walks and spins in horse-drawn carriages. My open space started filling up with roads, monuments, gardens, parks, tanks, fountains and sports clubs. In 1819, in the southeast corner came up the Calcutta Race Course, managed by the Royal Calcutta Turf Club. In 1835, Emily and Fanny Eden, sisters of Lord Auckland, the governor general, laid out gardens named after them at my northern end. Part of the garden later formed the Ranji cricket stadium, now famous as Eden Gardens. To my extreme south corner, in \u201ca waste space\u201d, the colossal St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral was built and consecrated in 1847. Victoria Memorial, the most spectacular monument and park, was built between 1904 and 1935 in my southeast corner; and the jail was shifted to Alipore. In the early 19th century, British administrators started decking me up with statues. These were statues of sovereign, viceroys, governor generals and distinguished colonial officials. Exquisitely carved by the best sculptors in Britain, these equestrian and pedestrian statues adorned my green acres. Then there were monuments \u2014 most prominently the Ochterlony Monument (later renamed Shahid Minar) \u2014 memorials and cenotaphs raised as tributes to commanders and soldiers who laid their lives to build the British Empire. After Independence, many of these were shifted out and in their place came up statues of Indian freedom fighters and dignitaries. Post-1947, the Indian Army became my owner as the fort became their Eastern Command headquarters. After the 1950s, I turned into a football and cricket hub. Several clubs, tents and stadiums came up; every weekend thousands thronged. And when political parties chose me as their venue \u2014 especially the Brigade Parade Ground \u2014 hundreds of thousands flooded my lawns. There was a time when I hosted fairs. One such was the Calcutta Book Fair but, sometime in the late 1990s, there was a devastating fire and that was the end of it. From being a humble local patch of green, my fame and name has spread far and wide. Now they call me the \u201cLungs of Calcutta\u201d, I am compared with the central parks of New York, London, Paris and Moscow. In the just published book Fort William and Calcutta Maidan: The British Heritage of Calcutta, Dalia Ray and P.T. Nair have offered rich tributes to me. In one place old man Nair says, \u201cTo every Calcuttan, the lasting and best gift of the British is surely the Maidan.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "Alexander Cunningham was the first director-general of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and J.D.M. Beglar, his assistant. The two, along with A.C.L. Carlleyle, were the first office-bearers of the ASI. That the Briton and the Armenian shared an enduring relationship was common enough knowledge. Then, in 2005, Calcutta\u2019s Victoria Memorial Hall (VMH) acquired a bunch of letters, mostly from Cunningham to Beglar. \u201cThe letters (written between 1871 and 1886) revealed unknown facets of Cunningham\u2019s personal and professional life and offered fascinating glimpses of the world he lived in. They are an enormously rich new source for the history of Indian archaeology,\u201d says Upinder Singh. An ancient Indian history scholar, Singh has for long researched Cunningham and written about him and his work. When she came to know about the letters, she wrote to the VMH requesting permission to edit and publish them. That was in 2006.   was co-published by VMH and the Oxford University Press in October 2021. Cunningham usually spent the winters in the field and the letters were written while he was on the move or from camps on-site. \u201cSeveral letters were written from Fir Hill, Shimla. Some were written from Calcutta\u2026 Others were written in Roorkee where Cunningham\u2019s son Allan taught. The last few were written after he returned home to Cranley Mansion on Gloucester Road in South Kensington,\u201d writes Singh in the Introduction. The first letter, written on January 28, 1871, was a formal invitation to Beglar, who was then a PWD engineer, to join his team. Cunningham had heard of Beglar\u2019s interest in photography and he had asked for some of his photographs. \u201cThe letter had an urgency to it. He wanted Beglar to decide immediately if he wanted the job,\u201d adds Singh. The second letter is dated 1874. By that time, the two men were better acquainted. Cunningham\u2019s letters began with \u201cMy dear Beglar\u201d instead of \u201cDear Sir\u201d. The frequency varied and there were long spells of silence as well. In the 1870s and 1880s, the ASI was a three-man team with a couple of support staff. \u201cThis single fact makes their achievements all the more remarkable,\u201d says Singh. The two men planned their itineraries such that they could meet during fieldwork. Beglar sent drafts of his reports to Cunningham, who at times praised them and at times ruthlessly criticised them. But there was also personal warmth and humour.  The letters describe archaeological discoveries \u2014 several of major historical importance \u2014 as they were made in real time. In 1875,  Cunningham   reports : \u201c Carllyleh as found Kapilavastu at Bhuila Tal, a place described by Buchanan.\u201d That autumn he writes: \u201cI have got proof that Pataliputra was on the Son.\u201d From Mathura in 1882: \u201cI found only one sculpture of any value. This is however a really valuable one \u2014 a group of Herakles killing the Nemean Lion!\u201d The letters transport the readers into the hustle and bustle of archaeological expeditions. There are repeated references to the weather. Cunningham complains of the heat thus: \u201cI am now melting away very fast.\u201d There are references to Beglar\u2019s fever and headaches, and Cunningham regularly makes enquiries about his health. Cunningham, one gathers from the exchange, kept up the pressure on his assistants. He feared that if the Archaeological Survey reports were not published on time, he would face punitive action from the government. Though surface exploration was what the ASI focused on, Cunningham was eager to excavate at Mathura, Garhwa, Bhitari and Kosam. He was keen on opening stupas for relics. Excavations were conducted at Bodh Gaya and Vaishali. Ashokan inscriptions were an abiding passion for him. Remains of  the Bharhut Stupa were discovered by Cunningham in November 1873. He was also largely responsible for removing the Bharhut sculptures to the Indian Museum in Calcutta, which has a dedicated gallery to it. After Bharhut, it was the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya that both Cunningham and Beglar worked on. Both men were widowed relatively early in life. They wrote to each other seeking comfort. Beglar moved between Chakdah and Chinsurah.  Cunningham  was joined by his sons, daughters-in-law and grandchildren in Shimla. Cunningham\u2019s handwriting becomes smaller and untidy from the 1880s. In September 1884, he informs Beglar he will resign. He is ready to leave but the ship carrying his possessions sinks. He loses his wife\u2019s portrait, papers, photographs and books. Beglar replaces as many books and photographs as he could. Cunningham writes: \u201cI am afraid you will never be a rich man.\u201d In February 1886, he sets sail for England. The last letter in the collection reads thus: \u201cI shall always be very glad to hear from you, and of your work. Believe in me to be always your sincere friend. Alex Cunningham.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "At the crossing of Pretoria Street and Theatre Road is what used to be the Metropolitan Nursing Home. The original structure was built 90 years ago. Then, in the 1930s, some Bengali doctors including Kanak Chandra Sarbadhikari, who was at the time principal of Calcutta Medical College, acquired the building and started the nursing home. In the 1980s, they were pressured to sell the property to a developer. Currently, there is a notice on site that reads Archana Properties Pvt. Ltd. \u201cConstruction has been stopped by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) as the builders were slowly demolishing the original house,\u201d a source tells . KMC rules work like this. Grade I heritage structure. No external change; use of building to be compatible with the structure. Grade II. No external change but new construction allowed within premises. Grade II B. Horizontal and vertical addition and alteration compatible with the original structure allowed. Grade III. Can be demolished; keep a plaque to identify to posterity its historical worth. Architect Partha Ranjan Das says the only way to preserve the memories of heritage buildings is to keep the shell and let new structures and development happen from within. He talks about Hearst Tower in New York City, US. It rises nearly 600 feet above its landmark six-storey base, which is the International Magazine building built by William Randolph Hearst in 1928. Calcutta\u2019s 12 Pretoria Street, once home to the Japanese consulate, echoes that idea. So does Inchcape House. Conservation architect Manish Chakrabarti, who was the project consultant, says, \u201cYou cannot just cut up like butter a five-storey building that rises to five metres and has one foot thick walls. It will topple. We, therefore, embraced the old colonial facade with buttresses to provide a counter force.\u201d G.M. Kapur  of Intach, Calcutta, says, \u201cNot all development looks incongruous.\u201d He cites the examples of Srijan House at 36/1A Elgin Road and the DBS Bank building at the crossing of Little Russel Street and Harrington Street.  But can this philosophy be applied uniformly? When The Statesman House turns into a shopping mall-cum-cineplex, won\u2019t the character of the Chowringhee precincts change dramatically? Sanghamitra Basu, a member of KMC\u2019s Heritage Conservation Committee, believes that depending on the character of the structure and the street it is on, there should be restrictions on height. Inventories of the building should be made and, thereafter, what should be kept and how should be established. \u201cBut this is possible only if there is a local area planning,\u201d she says. Basu points out, \u201cRetaining heritage is economically viable in the long run. See how Delhi and Ahmedabad are all getting heritage city tags. Look how Pondicherry managed to keep its French town intact by just colour coding the buildings.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "With the centenary of the Chauri Chaura incident round the corner, here is a remarkable Bengali theatre production that goes deep into the incident and its aftereffects. Anya Theatre premiered  ( ) on February 5, 2021. Written and directed by Debasish Ray, the production was staged for the second time at Madhusudan Mancha on December 12. It\u2019s been a long time since Bengali theatre took an empathetic look at events that unfolded in the Hindi heartland. Ray structures his play around Dinanath whose father (Surajit Ghosh), a policeman at Chauri Chaura, was burnt to death on that fateful night. This childhood trauma takes its toll on his mind, and eventually shapes his life and relationships, especially with his grandmother (Krishna Dutta) and his wife (played in turn by Ditipriya Sen and Minakshi Pramanik). But one cannot put   in a nutshell. Ray keeps shifting the narrator, facilitating multiple perspectives. The language also shifts effortlessly between standard Bengali and rustic Bhojpuri. The director trifurcates the protagonist. The three guest actors (Aphrodite Ray, Bhaskar Mukherjee and Partha Sinha), playing different ages of Dinanath, match one another. Ray infuses a dynamism \u2014 both in terms of movements and choreography \u2014 that the Anya Theatre actors negotiate quite commendably.  also explores the community life in Gorakhpur where marriage is a ritual and communal hatred has different ramifications. It connects, albeit slightly, to other violent moments in India\u2019s freedom struggle, especially the one led by Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt. As the narrative moves back and forth, the flexible proscenium space designed by Ray, where moveable bamboo structures and suspended ropes play a crucial part, pulsates with the rhythms of percussion instruments rooted in rural life. Subhadeep Guha\u2019s music design matches the earthly impulse. Ray\u2019s versatility reaches a new high in his light design which smartly uses unconventional sources like laser torches to demarcate national boundaries. This 110-minute-long   is among the best Calcutta has produced in recent years \u2014 it is not to be missed.",

        "Article Content": "The Raja Rammohun Roy Memorial Hall in Radhanagar in Bengal\u2019s Hooghly district is clearly visible from the main road. Radhanagar is the birthplace of Rammohun Roy, polyglot, social reformer, educationist, founder of the Brahmo Samaj, the original Renaissance Man of Bengal. Off the main road is a lane with two large walled compounds on either side. Compound 1 is where Roy\u2019s father Ramkanta had built a house. Today, standing in its place is the Radhanagar Rammohun Memorial Hall. Compound 2 houses the Rammohun Library and a replica of Roy\u2019s tomb in Bristol; he died in the United Kingdom in 1833. Nityabrata Mukherjee lives in Radhanagar and is a retired state government employee. His ancestors are from the same family as Roy\u2019s. The 73-year-old keeps talking about how his family has done its best to preserve the memories of their illustrious forefather. May 22 marked the 250th birth anniversary of Roy. I visited the place a fortnight before that. \u201cIn Calcutta there is a statue of him in one corner of the Maidan. It was inaugurated by Gyani Zail Singh in 1983, when he was President of India,\u201d says Ananda Kundu of Radhanagar Palli Samiti, a 99-year-old organisation that has been working towards the preservation of the memories of Roy. Kundu continues, \u201cEvery other statue in Calcutta has an electric light glowing at the base, but not this one. We requested the mayor, Firad Hakim, to have it lit up before the anniversary.\u201d It is not too different a scenario in  Radhanagar, 70 kilometres away from Calcutta. According to Kundu, Indira Gandhi was the last dignitary to visit the place. Two postal stamps were released on the 100th and 150th birth anniversaries of Rammohun and that was that.  Mukherjee and I walk into Compound 1. He points to a structure at the entrance. He says, \u201cThat was the room where Tarini Devi gave birth to Roy in 1772.\u201d The memorial hall was constructed by the first members of the Palli Samiti \u2014 educationist Jatindranath Basu was the secretary, Nobel laureate Rabindranth Tagore was the president and poet Satyendranath Dutta was the treasurer. The foundation stone was laid by Haimanti Devi of Jorasanko Thakurbari and Tagore himself conceptualised the house \u2014 though the sketch by him was lost long ago. There is a temple to the left of the building; the arches are like those you see in mosques. There is a pentagonal altar on the rear side of the building. \u201cIt was supposed to represent Christianity but was not completed,\u201d explains Mukherjee. Work on the building started in 1916 from donations by the people of Calcutta and Radhanagar. The highest donation was as much as one paisa. Though completed in 1929, the memorial hall remained a blind spot. And then in 1977, Jyoti Basu, who was then the chief minister of West Bengal, decided to make a museum of it. He donated some sculptures. At some point in the 1990s, a clay bust of Roy was commissioned; now it stands purposeless in the middle of a passageway. In one corner of the hall there is a larger-thanlife oil painting of Roy by Sisir Pal. Someone, or more, has disfigured it. \u201cSome child perhaps,\u201d says Mukherjee. Possible, except that the portrait is taller than him. No one ever goes to the library in Compound 2 that was opened in 2001 by the Raja Rammohun Roy Library Foundation, Calcutta, not even researchers. \u201cThey could not even pay the librarian the Rs 500-a-month honorarium,\u201d says Mukherjee. The Raja Rammohun Roy Mahavidyalaya in the neighbourhood was founded in 1964. It offers undergraduate courses in arts, science and commerce. It is closed for the summer vacations, but the cook at the college canteen, Pradip Ghosh, tells me that I must visit the Aambagan or mango grove. \u201cRoy had planted a mango tree in the northeast corner,\u201d says Mukherjee.  Ghosh adds, \u201cBut it was Roy\u2019s father who planted the trees. The grove belonged to him.\u201d What is today famed as the mango grove used to be the site of a crematorium till the mid-19th century. There is a pond close by; this is where the widows bathed and were \u201ccleansed\u201d before being led up to join the dead husband on the burning pyre. \u201cIf they resisted, they were beaten up and their limbs broken so they could not escape,\u201d says Mukherjee, his voice nearly drowned by the cheerful chatter of the tourists around. He points to a marble altar inside an enclosure. It bears the following inscription in Bengali script \u2014  . Mukherjee continues, \u201cThis is where Alak Manjari Devi, the young widow of Roy\u2019s elder brother, was burnt alive. They forced her to drink bhang before they led her to the pyre.\u201d That was 1811, 176 years before Roop Kanwar, the last sati of India. Deep inside the grove are the remains of the house Roy had built for himself when his father disowned him following his public critique of Hinduism. Through the broken pillars and arches, I can see couples chatting, clicking selfies, playing hide and seek. A young woman laughs out loud making two crows start and fly away. No, Roy would not be entirely disappointed.",

        "Article Content": "When you travel 235km by car on a crisp, sunny winter morning along a national highway, get ferried across the River Bhagirathi on a boat, take a tonga ride through the bylanes of an old Mughal town dotted with mango trees, and hop into a toto, all over one weekend, you are definitely having a blast. Our trip to Murshidabad was planned with some very close friends keeping Covid restrictions in mind and history as the main attraction. Situated on both banks of the River Bhagirathi, Murshidabad was magical in its quaintness, grandeur and nawabi charm. The city is steeped in history and has some of the country\u2019s grandest architecture dating back centuries. The town has earned its fame globally not only for its history, but its mangoes and silk and, of course, the Battle of Plassey or Palashi, immortalised in history for the  defeat of the last Nawab of Bengal, Siraj-ud-Daulah, who owed his allegiance to the Mughals, by the East India Company that set the ball rolling for the colonisation of India by the British. I must admit that we Indians, no matter where we belong, are conditioned to plan our meals whenever and however we travel, whatever be the destination. And it gets even better when Bangalis travel in winter. So, armed with copious quantities of food and   we hit the road at seven in the morning on the last weekend of January. For readers who would like to make this trip, the best route is Kolkata \u2014 Santragachhi \u2014  Dankuni \u2014 Tribeni \u2014 Kalna \u2014  Nabadwip \u2014 Krishnanagar \u2014 Berhampur \u2014 Murshidabad. To our delight, we spotted a cute little Cafe Coffee Day tucked away inside an HPCL fuel station on Durgapur Expressway and, even better, it had a clean washroom. For all you Google Map users, please do not key in Murshidabad as destination at the outset like we did as Google managed to lead us into shortcuts which were hardly worth driving on. Finally, we reached our destination, Jolchhobi resort, around 2pm, pleasantly hungry yet again after polishing off most of the food during two chai breaks. There are a couple of decent places to stay in Murshidabad, but Jolchhobi and Cossimbazar Rajbari of the Roys are not only beautiful but the hospitality deserves special mention. We selected the former as it is located right on the riverbank. It is new, smart, minimalistic and looks very contemporary. The resort has its own boat, so we took a cruise across the river to experience the most picturesque sunset amidst flights of unknown flocks in the sky. There is something soulful about being in the midst of nowhere. The Bhagirathi is not very wide but extremely deep. The silence consumes you. And the sheer idea of being without a mask was so liberating. During the Mughal era around the time of Aurangzeb, this town was a seat of trade attracting the Portuguese, the British and the French. It is quite evident why the Mughals shifted the eastern capital from Dhaka to Murshidabad. History unfurled itself in the form of rippled watercolour as we glided over the gentle waves. Way back in 1717, Aurangzeb made Murshid Quli Khan the governor of Bengal and the town was later named after him. Trade flourished owing to its riverine location and, soon, traders from all over the country as well as the British, the French and the Portuguese started frequenting it and some settled there too. We will not delve too deep into history, but the family of Jagat Seth, the Singhs from present Uttar Pradesh, and the Dugars settled in Murshidabad. Jagat Seth\u2019s family was the state banker for generations. The nawabs of Bengal were given the right to rule over Bengal, Odisha and Bihar by the Mughal emperor and were backed by financiers like Seth. The development and growth of the town and its majestic architecture is directly connected to flourishing trade and the alluvial soil on which thrived dozens of varieties of mangoes. Interestingly, the villas at our resort were each named after a type of mango \u2014 Golapkhash, Dilkhush, Nawabpasand, Himsagar, Bira, and so on. So my next trip will surely be in summer and dedicated to the nawab of fruits. The day after we reached, the resort arranged for a tonga ride to relish the local flavour. It\u2019s not the most comfortable ride, but post-Covid we felt it was our duty to use the services of local people after the crushing economic slump. Our first destination was, obviously, the Hazarduari Palace. As the name suggests, the grand, stately piece of architecture, rectangular in shape, boasts of a thousand doors. Only a hundred of these are actual functional doors. The rest were built to misguide the bargis, or Maratha invaders and other miscreants. Built by Nawab Nazir Humayun Jah, it is a three-storied edifice, very European, with a huge flight of stairs. The Hazarduari shares its premises wih the Nizamat Imambara built by Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah in 1740, which is another artchitectural wonder. It is supposedly one of the largest imambaras in the world. The Hazarduari Palace has been converted into a museum, but due to the pandemic visitors are not allowed. The area is dotted with souvenir shops selling beautiful metal (kansha), wood and shola handicrafts. Murshidabad is adorned by several other palaces and rajbaris too. I personally found the Kathgola Palace to be the most picturesque. Built by Lakshmipath Singh Dugar, it is a four-storied structure with an impressive ornamental facade that is located in an enormous  or mango orchard. Our next destinations were Katra Masjid and Nasipur Palace via Jagat Seth\u2019s residence. An absolute contrast to the Hazarduari, the Katra Masjid, built on a sprawling area, displays mammoth Islamic architecture. It houses the tomb of Nawab Murshid Quli Khan. After an hour on the tonga, our fragile backs were as good as gone. So some of us hopped into a Toto (battery-powered small vehicles). Nasipur is a small village in Lalbagh. Built by Raja Kirti Chandra Singha Bahadur, and later taken over by Raja Debi Singha, the Nasipur Rajbari wears a somewhat forlorn look today. Like many of the settlers who amassed huge wealth owing to their loyalty to the East India Company, Debi Singha, too, hailed from Panipat. Debi Singha was a strict tax collector, one could also call him an extortionist. I personally found his story \u2014 a saga of extortion and debauchery \u2014 most fascinating. Debi Singha\u2019s court was illuminated by the famous courtesan Hirabai, who, according to folklore, would be paid 5,000 gold coins for each performance! If any of you have read or watched Tagore\u2019s  , this palace is a definite reminder of the tragic tale. Unfortunately, the upkeep is rundown but the courtyard,  and the temples and even the room for beheading tax defaulters inside the palace tell many tales. Our last destination was the house where Mir Jafar lived. Infamous till date for his betrayal, Mir Jafar was Siraj\u2019s general who, with the help of Jagat Seth, allied with Robert Clive of East India Company and betrayed Siraj to become the first nawab of Bengal who owed allegiance to the British. Till date the family is treated like social outcasts! Our lunch was pre-booked at the famous Cossimbazar Rajbari of the Roys. Fabulously maintained by the Roy family who have owned it for generations, the pristine white building is a perfect amalgam of the west and east. Run at present by Pallab Roy, a descendent of the family, the emerald green lawns are embellished by a riot of seasonal blooms. It is a regal retreat with plush living quarters and ornate furniture which will make you feel like royalty. The family crest is carved most fashionably above the pediment over the main gate. The \u2018royal lunch\u2019 or served at the Rajbari should not be missed. It is a seven-course sinfully opulent spread. We were lucky to be given a tour of the palace by Pallab Roy himself. Tucked away inside the Rajbari is a boutique with beautiful souvenirs , handicrafts like  , Krishnanagar dolls,   (bronze) and hand-painted silks. The last leg and another very interesting adventure awaited us \u2014 a trip to the   or weavers\u2019 neighbourhood. Our Toto driver served as our guide. This is a cluster of villages consisting of families who have been weaving some of the most beautiful Murshidabad silks. There are rows of homes of different scales, some with one loom, some with more. Unfortunately, these talented artisans have to keep at their craft under rather impoverished circumstances. They were most hospitable to tourists like us indulging in retail therapy. We feasted our eyes on some fabulous gheecha, tussore and Murshidabad silks, some of them hand-painted. That night, when we sat on our balcony wondering at the quiet river that fostered the old town and was witness to so much, I remembered the old lullaby:  The author is a PR professional turned social entrepreneur",

        "Article Content": "In our 20s and 30s, there can be immense pressure to measure up to the expectations of society, our families, our friends and even those we have for ourselves. Many people look back and feel disappointed that they hadn't taken the opportunity to travel more. Others might have envisioned that they would be further along in their careers or personal relationships. In reality, life is hard and we might face setbacks (big and small) that can shatter our dreams, leaving us with fragments we perceive as worthless. Feelings of failure can take a long-lasting mental toll but they don't have to stop you in your tracks. There are many teachings, practices and philosophies that can help you deal with disappointment, embrace imperfection and remain optimistic. One such practice is the Japanese art form of kintsugi, which means joining with gold. It has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years as both an art technique, a worldview and metaphor for how we can live life. Many forms of Japanese art have been influenced by Zen and Mahayana philosophies, which champion the concepts of acceptance and contemplation of imperfection, as well as the constant flux and impermanence of all things. Kintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery. If a bowl is broken, rather than discarding the pieces, the fragments are put back together with a glue-like tree sap and the cracks are adorned with gold. There are no attempts to hide the damage, instead, it is highlighted. The practice has come to represent the idea that beauty can be found in imperfection. The breakage is an opportunity and applying this kind of thinking to instances of failure in our own lives can be helpful. Kintsugi was fairly widespread in Japan around the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The origins of this aesthetic go back hundreds of years to the Muromachi period (approximately 1336 to 1573). The third ruling Shogun (leader) of that era, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358-1408), is said to have broken his favourite tea bowl. The bowl was unique and could not be replaced. So, instead of throwing it away, he sent it to China for a replacement or repair. The bowl returned repaired with its pieces held in place by metal staples. Staple repair was a common technique in China as well as in parts of Europe at the time for particularly valuable pieces. However, the Shogun considered it to be neither functional nor beautiful. Instead, the Shogun had his own artisans resolve the situation by finding a method to make something beautiful from the broken, damaged object, but without disguising the damage. And so, kintsugi came to be. Kintsugi makes something new from a broken pot, which is transformed to possess a different sort of beauty. The imperfection, the golden cracks, are what make the new object unique. They are there every time you look at it and they welcome contemplation of the object's past and of the moment of failure that it and its owner has overcome. The art of kintsugi is inextricably linked to the Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi: a worldview centred on the acceptance of transience, imperfection and the beauty found in simplicity. Wabi-sabi is also an appreciation of both natural objects and the forces of nature that remind us that nothing stays the same forever. Wabi-sabi can also be incorporated into contemplating something and seeing it grow more beautiful as time passes. As a craft and an art form, kintsugi challenges expectations. This is because the technique goes further than repairing an object but actually transforms and intentionally changes its appearance. In an age of mass production and conformity, learning to accept and celebrate imperfect things, as kintsugi demonstrates, can be powerful. Whether it's reeling from a breakup or being turned down for a promotion, the fragments of our disappointment can be transformed into something new. That new thing might not be perfect or be how you had envisioned it would be, but it is beautiful. Rather than try to disguise the flaws, the kintsugi technique highlights and draws attention to them. The philosophy of kintsugi, as an approach to life, can help encourage us when we face failure. We can try to pick up the pieces, and if we manage to do that we can put them back together. The result might not seem beautiful straight away but as wabi-sabi teaches, as time passes, we may be able to appreciate the beauty of those imperfections. The bowl may seem broken, the pieces scattered, but this is an opportunity to put it back together with seams of gold. It will be something new, unique and strong.",

I probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered to enrol\nmyself, but my elder sister did, so I went along for the ride. I did my schooling at\nThe Modern High School for Girls, and later moved to London College of Fashion\nand Central Saint Martins for my higher education. I was always inclined\ntowards art and design, but finally dropped out and moved to food, which was my\ntrue north, and studied cuisine and patisserie at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris in\n2010.  Kolkata is my roots,\nmy foundation and will forever be. Growing up in Kolkata \u2014 it felt safe. The\npeople of Bengal have touched my life and they influence me till date with\ntheir love, culture, emotions and especially food.  Bengali food like  ,  , and Gobindobhog rice is still my go-to\nmeal after a long day at work.   From what my mum tells\nme, I started cooking at the age of four or five. I remember standing on a\nstool with my mum by my side while I instructed how I wanted the vegetables to\nbe chopped, sauteed and flavoured. I think I always took cooking for granted,\nbut my family always encouraged it. Even whilst I was away in London studying\nfashion, I think I spent all my allowance on grocery shopping and feeding my\nfriends, flatmates and their friends. It is such a joy to be in the kitchen and\nfeed people! I realised cooking\nalways came naturally to me. I could cook anywhere, anytime \u2014 even when I lived\nin the Himalayas for a couple of years a decade ago. I intuitively cooked a\nwhole meal for the first time with a single clay stove in the higher Himalayas with\nwhatever was available, which wasn\u2019t a lot.  I started my company\nnamed Pepperstar in Kolkata, back in 2009. I did bespoke 7- to 14-course\nsit-down private dinners and events.

Hearth & I\nspecialises in sit-down 7- to 14-course menus, world cuisines and patisseries \u2014\nfocusing mostly on western cuisine. We also do some regional cuisines like\nBengali, Marwari, Garhwali and Goan. We have started catering as well. We have\ndone pop-ups and Indian workshops in places like the UK, French Alps, and\nIceland.   We have a core team of\n15 people currently and also collaborate with local chefs across the world for\nlarger events.  I think the greatest\nmilestone is that we barely do any marketing and that we\u2019ve been able to grow a\nwonderful clientele in Delhi NCR, which not being my home base is a big thing\nfor me. Eventually it\u2019s this clientele that literally forced us into catering\nand now that wing has grown beautifully and steadily across India and Europe as\nwell.

        "Article Content": "Until the discovery of the Indus Valley, the British had a poor opinion of India, its heritage and culture. The prevalent thought was that Indian civilisation dated back to 1200-1500 BCE. The \u201cAryans\u201d were believed to be proto-Europeans, ancestors of the British and other European colonialists who invaded India and apparently civilised a barbaric people. But the discovery pushed our history back to before 3000 BCE. It even gave a boost to the Swadeshi movement of the 1920s. See, the British were colonists who made their fortune from India. But they also introduced modern education, railways, post and telegraph services, and trained us so we could appreciate our own culture. Other colonists, such as the Spanish, destroyed temples, burnt historical texts and melted precious works of art of the ancient Aztec and Inca civilisations of South America. The British restored our temples and trained us to dig the ruins. Sir Alexander Cunningham, an army engineer, founded the ASI and excavated Buddhist sites such as Sanchi and Sarnath. Sir John Marshall, ASI\u2019s director-general, led the excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. Mortimer Wheeler did seminal work for the Indus Valley Civilisation and even opened a training school at Taxila to train young archaeologists such as Braj Basi Lal. James Prinsep, an antiquarian, deciphered the ancient Kharosthi and Brahmi scripts. Initially, Banerji had been one of the blue-eyed boys of Marshall. He was promoted to the position of the head of the western circle of the ASI \u2014 the largest circle extending from Sind to central India. He was deputed to excavate the site that turned out to be Mohenjo-daro. But Banerji was also a staunch nationalist, an erudite person and a strongly opinionated soul. He ruffled the feathers of Marshall and was forced to resign. Marshall, however, was never antiIndian. He nurtured archaeologists like Nani Gopal Majumdar, another Bengali genius, who was killed by robbers while on duty in Sindh. Majumdar went on to discover 62 sites of the preHarappan era that pushed back Indus Valley\u2019s antiquity beyond 4500 BCE. These people were quite egalitarian compared to those in Egypt or Mesopotamia. The excavated sites show that the rich and poor lived in similar houses. They didn\u2019t waste wealth amassed through the exploitation of common people, unlike the Egyptian pharaohs, on the dead. You\u2019ll hardly find any gold in the graves but rather exquisitely carved pottery or sculptures to honour the dead. Neither did they build colossal ziggurats like the Mesopotamians. They were truly educated people who believed in simple living and high thinking. They had impeccable aesthetic sense too. Yes. They faced acute drought due to decreasing rainfall and rapid desertification. Rivers dried up and they had to abandon such beautiful cities and disperse to small villages. Gradually, they migrated to greener areas in the east in Rakhigarhi (Haryana) and even towards the west in Dholavira (Gujarat). Climate change affected their material production and trade too. I led a team at Dholavira that discovered inscriptions on a stone slab in 1999. The inscription may have been longer, but the stone was found broken into pieces. The stone must have been used as a lintel of the doorway of an underground chamber so that people would notice it. It may have been the name of the house, its owner or an incantation. In 1991, we found 10 large stone inscriptions carved in Indus script. The signs were made of thoroughly baked gypsum for a shiny effect. This is the reason I emphasise that Harappan society was a highly literate society. We found seals, fish hooks, animal figurines, tablets, terracotta pottery, beads, bangles and copper tools with Indus signs everywhere in the citadel, the middle town, the lower town and the annexe of the Dholavira site. . During my tenure with the ASI, I marked a large number of unexcavated mounds in Rakhigarhi, Banawali and Dholavira as \u201cprotected monuments\u2019\u2019. Dholavira is now also a Unesco heritage site. Collecting artefacts or desecrating these monuments is a punishable offence. But the administration often can\u2019t act because some of the mounds are thickly populated, where you can neither carry out excavation, nor displace people. Unless young people \u2014 especially school students \u2014 learn to appreciate our rich ancient heritage, such criminal offences can\u2019t be stopped.",

        "Article Content": "Remember\nRoald Dahl\u2019s  ? In Hyderabad\u2019s Banjara\nHills, that fantastical vision has come to life. Chaitanya Muppala has brought\nthe imagination of an immersive chocolate factory to reality with Manam\nChocolate Karkhana, an Indian craft chocolate brand producing confections\ndirectly from cacao pods, in Hyderabad. Established in 2023, Manam Chocolates is celebrating\nits first anniversary with a prestigious feature in TIME\u2019s annual list of the\n\u2018World\u2019s Greatest Places 2024\u2019. To explore the world of Manam\u2019s chocolatey\nmagic,   spoke with founder Chaitanya Muppala.  Chaitanya Muppala\u2019s family has been delighting taste buds with\ntheir popular gourmet sweet and snack brand, Almond House, for the past 30\nyears. Chaitanya joined the family business at 24, infusing it with fresh\nideas. An alumnus of the Sauder School of Business, University of British\nColumbia, and a graduate of the Stanford Seed Program from Stanford\nUniversity\u2019s Graduate School of Business, Chaitanya had a passion for advancing the\nfood industry. \u201cIn 2018, I started studying the quality of Indian\nchocolate. I realised the difference between industrial and craft chocolate.\nThere were hardly any craft chocolate players in the market. Moreover, the\ncraft chocolates available in the market were mostly expensive. When talking\nabout good quality chocolates, people hardly speak about the Indian brands. It\nis often international chocolates that are popular. That\u2019s when I realised we\nneeded a business model for fine-flavoured Indian craft chocolate,\u201d recalled\nMuppala.  Following this, in 2021, he incorporated Distinct Origins Private\nLimited to establish the West Godavari region as a place of origin from where\npotential global craft chocolate makers could import best cacao beans. To\nachieve this, he recruited over 100 cacao farmers to cultivate 1,500 acres of\nland. Then, Muppala embarked on building India\u2019s largest fine-flavour cocoa\nfermentary in Tadikalapudi,  Andhra Pradesh. His vision was to\ncreate a transparent and equitably traded source of fine-flavour cocoa from\nIndia. \u201cDuring this time, I realised that our Indian cacao has great\npotential. The chocolates we make here can be of international standard like\nSwiss and Belgian chocolates,\u201d said Muppala.  At the fermentary,  top-notch scientific fermentation and\ndrying techniques are employed to extract the unique flavours of Indian cacao\nbeans. \u201cOur approach isn\u2019t bean-to-bar like many chocolate makers in the\ncountry. We start much earlier, focusing on cultivating cacao pods with the\ndesired characteristics,\u201d explained Muppala. Once processed, the beans are sent to Manam Chocolate Karkhana in\nHyderabad, where they are crafted into exquisite chocolate confections by the\nin-house team of chocolate makers and chocolatiers. \u201cOur chocolate makers push\nthe boundaries of Indian cacao,\u201d said Muppala, adding, \u201cManam Chocolate\nfeatures a diverse collection, including single-farm series, single origin\nseries, creative fermentation series, signature blends \u2014 and an array of\nexciting infusions and inclusions. We make chocolate for bakers and enthusiasts\nalike.\u201d Once the fermentary was set up, Muppala wanted to offer his\ncustomers a unique retail experience. \u201cWe did not want a regular retail outlet.\nWe wanted our customers to understand how their chocolate is made. We aimed to\neducate people about Indian cacao and its potential. That\u2019s why the Karkhana\nwas built as an immersive chocolate factory spread over 10,000 sq ft, where\nvisitors can come, learn, watch their chocolate being made, create their own\nflavours, and purchase,\u201d said the Level-3 certified chocolate taster. At the factory or  , visitors can witness the entire\nprocess of chocolate production at the live chocolate-making section. The\nchocolate makers craft a range of signature couvertures, where raw cacao beans\ngo through roasting, winnowing, grinding, refining, conching, tempering and\nmoulding to become smooth, luscious chocolate. Visitors can also see Manam\u2019s chocolatiers artfully creating a\nworld of unique confections, from indulgent bonbons, truffles to snackable\nbarks and clusters, as well as Manam\u2019s range of cakes and entremets. You can\ntaste these delish treats too. The chocolate lab at the  is a delightful place\nwhere visitors can use their creativity to create flavours and make their own\nchocolate tablets. Visitors can choose from a range of flowing origin\nchocolates on tap and add their favourite toppings. You can even take home your\ncreation. In the Manam classroom, knowledge is imparted on fine-flavoured\nIndian cacao and craft chocolate through short knowledge programmes and\nworkshops. Chocolate lovers can engage with other enthusiasts, experience\ntastings and enjoy more nuanced experiences with chocolate. Manam Cafe, also part of the factory, is an all-day casual dining\nspace where chocolate meets specialty coffees made with signature blends from\nIndian coffee beans! The cafe features cacao trees planted throughout to\nconnect people with the origin of their favourite chocolate. This immersive experience at the factory earned Manam Chocolate\nKarkhana a spot on TIME\u2019s annual list of the World\u2019s Greatest Places,\nhighlighting 100 extraordinary destinations to visit and stay. Recalling the day of the Karkhana\u2019s opening last year, the\nfounder said, \u201cWhen we opened, people came from all over the city. Soon there\nwas a traffic disruption in front of the road, and we had to close visitations\nand limit entry. It was such an overwhelming experience for us.\u201d Manam Chocolate offers more than 300 products across 50\ncategories. These categories include the Manam Signature Tablet Collection,\nwhich features 43 types of chocolate bars, the Chocolate Maker\u2019s Single Origin\nInternational Series, the Creative Fermentation Series, the Chocolate Maker\u2019s\nSingle Farm Series, and the Chocolate Maker\u2019s Single Origin India Series, among\nother curated bars. There are dairy-free and sugar-free options as well. The Chocolatier\u2019s Indulgence Collection includes Manam\u2019s signature\nitems, like bonbons, truffles, fudge, brownies and more \u2014 all crafted with\nsingle-origin chocolates. The Chocolatier\u2019s Snacking Collection offers treats\nlike macarons, cookies, barks, spreads and more. The Baker\u2019s Collection features baking cacao nibs, chocolate\nbaking tablets and pods, cacao butter baking tablets and pods, and baking cacao\npowder. There are also products for making drinking chocolate. Speaking about the diverse range of products, Muppala\nsaid, \u201cWe are not only providing craft chocolates to consumers, but we are also\nlooking forward to partnering with chefs to create unique confections. We have\nalready collaborated with several cafes. One of our recent collaborations is\nwith Burma Burma India, where we made chocolate bubble tea together.\u201d When quizzed what are the founder's favourite chocolates from his\nbrand, he said, \u201cThe 100 per cent dark single-origin chocolate from West Godavari,\nAlmond Praline Clusters and Pecan Caramel Entremet.\u201d \nIn Telugu,  means \u2018we\u2019 or \u2018us\u2019,\nand fittingly, Manam Chocolate is celebrating its one-year anniversary this\nAugust with a mission to revolutionise the Indian chocolate industry. Sharing\nplans for the brand, Chaitanya Muppala said, \u201cWe are planning to expand to\nother cities in India. While it won\u2019t be the full-fledged  , we\nwill have retail stores in cities like Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai. Kolkata is\nnot yet on the list, but we would love to start operations there too. We are\nalso looking forward to working with chefs to create more confections.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "In 2016, Aditi Dugar\nmade waves in Mumbai by introducing one of India\u2019s first tasting menus,\npioneering a new dining experience in a country where dining was typically\nlimited to \u2018a la carte\u2019 and \u2018buffet\u2019. Now, in 2024, the 41-year-old is all set\nto \u201copen the most sought-after bar in Mumbai\u201d. Dugar\u2019s impressive run also\nincludes becoming the first female restaurateur featured on   list and catering for the Ambani wedding. As her\nrestaurant Masque continues to earn accolades, recently earning a spot on   list, Dugar remains at the forefront of the industry.   caught up with the young and spirited restaurateur to discuss her\nremarkable journey in the culinary world and what\u2019s next for Urban Gourmet\nIndia, the parent company behind her ventures.  Edited exceprts follow. My experience with food and styling comes with  , my\nboutique catering company. Over the years, it has given me some wonderful\ninsights into what clients expect from their dining experiences. I also love\neating and discovering local food when I travel \u2014 it could be a taco off a food\ntruck in New York or a tasting menu in Vietnam and anything in between. All of\nmy experiences and experiments with food have helped in shaping me as a food\nentrepreneur.  Honestly, I believe\nthere\u2019s so much more to food than just \u2018great food\u2019; it\u2019s about the entire\nexperience that comes with the meal. As guests, we love it when a restaurant\nhas great, tasteful decor, excellent service and staff that treats you like\nyou\u2019re the only guest in the room! So, I wanted to create a space that leaves\nguests with a memory they\u2019re going to remember fondly for a long time to\ncome.  When I put all of\nthese learnings and observations together, I realised that there was definitely\na space for a modern Indian fine-dining restaurant \u2014 it seemed like the perfect\ntime to introduce a tasting menu. And well, that\u2019s how Masque came to be in 2016.  It\u2019s an incredible\nfeeling, honestly. The \u2018manifesting\u2019, as you say, happened through a lot of\nhard work by the team, head chef  \u2019s superb\nleadership and all the talent we have brought in over the years. We\u2019ve received\nso much love and recognition from fellow restaurateurs and guests. This kind of\naccolade tells us that we\u2019re doing the right thing and that we need to keep\nrefining what we do. It really keeps us going (forgive the clich\u00e9) and upping\nour own ambition.  Being on the The\nWorld\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants list has also introduced us to global forums and\nhelped foster meaningful connections. One of the most wholesome perks of being\non the list is finding community beyond borders and connecting with top\nrestaurateurs from around the world.  As I mentioned\nearlier, a restaurant is about so much more than just the food. In fact, I\u2019ll\ngo out on a limb and say creating stellar food is perhaps the easiest bit, all\nelse considered. As important as great food is, equally crucial is having a\nsolid culture, attracting the best talent, understanding operations, managing a\nteam, curating great music and decor, finding the best suppliers, positioning\nthe brand perfectly, getting the marketing right \u2014 and over everything, topping\nit off with the generosity of the heart. In this business, there\u2019s always\nsomething that can go wrong if it hasn\u2019t already.  My experience with\nrunning Sage & Saffron made me realise that truly memorable food\nexperiences were missing in India. All of this led me to start Masque, despite\nall the challenges that come with the territory. The food business is unlike\nany other commercial business. It\u2019s always on, and each day is full of new\nchallenges. But you learn to ride them and enjoy the highs, which make it all\nworthwhile. We\u2019ve signed NDAs and\ncannot disclose any details about the event.  TwentySeven Pizza\n& Bakes is the newest addition to the Urban Gourmet portfolio \u2014 an\nextension of TwentySeven Bakehouse, our much-loved, neighbourhood bakery in\nBandra, Mumbai. In addition to all the popular bakes from our menu, we\u2019ve\nintroduced authentic, hot and crispy New York-style pies at Pizza & Bakes.\nChef   \u2014 international pizza consultant and known to the world as the \u2018Pizza\nCzar\u2019 (accurately so!) \u2014 has consulted on the entire menu.  Why does it stand out?\nWell, because it serves really great pizza! Now, while pizza is quite a\nubiquitous offering in Mumbai, finding authentic NY-style pies wasn\u2019t really\neasy. My husband and business partner, Aditya [Dugar], felt that it was time to\nhave a pizza place and introduce guests to some NY classics.  Hindsight, as they\nsay, is always 20:20. But I don\u2019t think Masque would have been what it is if it\nweren\u2019t for all the learnings. Upping the guest experience, building a solid\nteam, having strong relationships with our wonderful farm partners and becoming\nknown for a stellar experience \u2014 these are never things anyone can get right on\nDay One. And while we are our best version today, we\u2019re going to be leaps ahead\ntomorrow, in 10 days and five years. This is an ongoing journey and we\u2019re\nalways a sum of our mistakes and imperfections. It\u2019s just about learning from\nthem and becoming the next best version of ourselves.  There\u2019s always so much\nto learn and to be inspired from. Meeting chefs and restaurant owners from\naround the globe is one of my favourite parts of being a food entrepreneur. The\nconstant give-and-take of ideas is a perpetual inspiration for me and my team.  Having stale and\nstagnant ideas is a death knell in our line of work. One very random exchange\nwith a chef from another country can spark a whole idea or a dish that ends up\non the menu. We also learn from each other\u2019s mistakes and challenges. It\u2019s also\noften eye-opening to realise how some difficulties of the food world are\nuniversal. Overall, it\u2019s a community of people who are always looking to learn\nfrom and support each other.  Goda Masala, Clams and Karandi Loncha; the Citrus Cacao dessert Vada Pav Danish, Basque Cheesecake, Chorizo 2.0  Anything from Masque\u2019s dessert menu, Thai food from the Sage & Saffron kitchen, and the Soft Serve and the Vada Pav Danish from TwentySeven Bakehouse  Open the most sought-after bar in Mumbai!",

        "Article Content": "Austria is a beautiful country in western Europe. The capital city of Vienna boasts of the country\u2019s legacy with palaces, art and grand structures built during the mighty Austrian Empire. While their accomplishments and laurels are many, it\u2019s their unwavering love and dedication to pastry that has left an indelible mark on the country. Vienna is home to several cafes, most of which have been around for centuries, and played favourite to several in the monarchy. While these cafes are popular with diners, they\u2019re most frequented for their delectable pastry. There is no denying Austrian cakes are exquisite. If you\u2019re planning a trip to any Austrian city, make sure you try some of these heavenly cakes. Arguably the most iconic pastry in Austria \u2014 thanks to tourist guides and a fair bit of marketing \u2014 the Sachertorte might also be the most well-known pastry in Vienna. Torte is the Austrian-German word for a dense cake or  . The Sachertorte is said to have been invented in 1832 by Franz Sacher who was a pastry chef for Prince Clemens Lothar Wensel Metternich, the then State Chancellor of Austria. The prince wanted a new cake and this chocolate sponge with a thin coating of apricot jam and a chocolate glaze was created. It is found at every caf\u00e9 and pastry shop across the country but tourists flock up at the Hotel Sacher in Vienna to try the original cake. Another iconic dessert you\u2019ll find all over the country is the Apfelstrudel or Apple Strudel. Austria loves its strudel \u2014 a baked pastry with a sweet filling usually made of fruit, layered between the dough \u2014 and who can blame them! This decadent dessert is made with thin layers of pastry dough filled with the sweetest, juiciest apples, raisins and nuts topped with bread crumbs and baked into a glorious pie, served with a generous dollop of ice cream or custard. Named after the Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, this cake is actually inspired by a famous Austrian chocolate called Mozartkugel. First known as a Mozart-Bonbon, and created in 1890 by Salzburg confectioner Paul F\u00fcrst, the small chocolate ball is filled with pistachio, marzipan and nougat. It\u2019s so popular that you\u2019ll find these packets at any souvenir shop across the country and make for lovely presents to take back home. The cake has similar ingredients and is a treat if you enjoy either pistachio or marzipan, or both. Often called the Emperor\u2019s Mess, this dessert is named after the emperor Kaiser Franz Joseph I, who loved this dish. It\u2019s actually fluffy, light, slightly caramelised pancakes that have been shredded or scrambled, and lavishly dusted with powdered sugar. It usually contains raisins or dried cranberries and if served with a helping of applesauce, or plum compote or cherry jam. Though named after the Kaiser, it\u2019s a simple dessert, yet wholesome and satisfying, and very different from all the cakes and tortes. This bright pink cube like pastry is a winter-time favourite often found at Austria\u2019s Christmas markets.  is a popular liquor that seems like mulled wine, but actually has a base of rum. This cubic sponge is soaked in the  and the cake usually has a layer of apricot jelly or nougat, all covered in pretty pink fondant and often garnished with a cherry on top. It\u2019s not a traditional cake due to its size but is a seriously underrated, and delicious offering. Any Kolkatan will immediately see how similar it looks to Flurys iconic Strawberry Cube! With the recipe mentioned in a cookbook dated nearly 300 years ago, many consider the Linzer Torte to be the oldest cake recipe in the world. While there\u2019s no real proof or truth to this claim, it\u2019s a wonderful story to think about while eating this cake that\u2019s more like a pie. The top lattice-like layer of pastry with red currant marmalade peeking through, and almonds and hazelnut lining the top \u2014 the pie named after the city of Liz is pretty as a picture. The trick is to shave the almonds into the dough for the top layer and it\u2019s the perfect mix between a cake and pie \u2014 the best of both worlds.",

He has collaborated with several brands, attended several events across the country and garnered much appreciation for his achievements. Yet, there was only one question his fans and well-wishers had \u2014 when will he have his own restaurant?  One year ago, when the newly crowned winner of the cooking reality show was in Kolkata for a workshop, he spoke to   about  . One of them was to open a restaurant of his own by 2025. This September 5, the 28-year-old boy from Tinsukia, Assam, has achieved his dream and is going to inaugurate his restaurant, Roohani, at the Central Mall on Guwahati-Shillong Road in the capital city of Assam. Ahead of the opening, the chef, and now restaurateur, in a quick chat, gave   a preview of his new venture. Edited excerpts from the conversation\u2026 Nayanjyoti Saikia: Thank you, so much! We are opening at GS Road (Guwahati-Shillong Road), in Block B of Central Mall. The inauguration is on September 5. On that day, we have invited some guests, including influencers and local celebrities from Assam. The press and media will also be there.

This will be available for prior booking. From September 7 onwards, we open it for the public.  The menu is progressive modern cuisine that will have an influence of the hyperlocal ingredients. It includes dishes that I like. For example, we have my favourite pastas and some of my favourite Thai dishes. Basically, the dishes I thought I had the scope to play around with my own innovations. We are focussing on elevating popular dishes like kebabs. We will be doing kebabs but with local twists where we use our local lime, different kinds of northeastern chillies and herbs. We are also focusing on desserts (he was popular for his desserts on MasterChef). There are many desserts with some innovative touches. We are planning on desserts like Kaji Nemu Tart Oasis, which brings together Assamese flavours and French patisserie techniques. We have used Kaji Nemu in it, which is our local Assamese lemon. We have something called Bumble Bee which is a rich wild honey frozen parfait with crumbly almond sable drizzled honey caramel. We have used our local roselle flower in the sorbets and syrups. The trials are still going on. We will have the final menu ready soon. Oh yes, quite a few. The curried crab starter I made for the finale is on the menu. The buffalo wings that were liked by the judges will be there. Many of the desserts too like the parfaits are on the menu.  On the first floor we have the restaurant which is an eighty-seater space. On the second floor we have the pub, which can accommodate another 70-80 people. So in total it is a 150-seater restaurant.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely! We are actually still working on the menu. But there will be one of my favourite cocktails. Which is a roselle flower syrup cocktail stirred with white rum or vodka and infused with kafir leaves. So it is sweet and sour with a lemony zest!  The ideation began in April 2023. I wanted to take some time to learn how to function in a restaurant kitchen, work with a team and understand the business. Finally this year, around February, I felt confident enough and approached an investor. They said, \u201cLet\u2019s do it. It\u2019s now or never.\u201d So, then we began with everything, right from setting up the place to curating the menu. We are still forming our team. While I head the kitchen, we have a chef from Uttarakhand who will be doing the kebabs. We have an Indian chef, an executive chef and more people will be joining us. You\u2019ll get to know the team soon.  It has helped me in many ways, of course. I learnt several techniques from the mentors and judges that are proving to be helpful to me now. Working in teams with other contestants taught me teamwork. Before MasterChef happened, I was an introvert. I would work in my own kitchen. But the show made me confident. I have invited the judges and my fellow contestants to the restaurant. Most of them are busy at the moment, but some of my MasterChef friends have promised to visit in October.  When we were thinking about the name, we had a fine-dining restaurant in mind. My favourite colour was purple, so we thought of giving a velvety, purple look to the restaurant, which exudes a classy vibe. There were many other names after that. But when we decided on progressive Indian cuisine, we knew we wanted an Indian look and feel and an Indian name! That's when we named it \u2018Roohani\u2019, which means soulful. And that's what we are going to do \u2014 serve soulful food that touches the soul of our diners. ",

        "Article Content": "Kolkata\u2019s street food scene is legendary \u2014 from    and chaat to rolls, kebabs and   \u2014 but have you ever tried the kebabs at this place in Kasba that also serves  pizza? Founded five years ago by brothers Akash and Binoy Mazumdar on Rajdanga Main Road,   brings a creative twist to street food. Their signature Kulhad Pizza \u2014 loaded with cream, cheese, chicken and veggies \u2014 is a must try. Speaking to  , 33-year-old co-owner Akash Mazumdar said, \u201cI used to work in the IT sector, including a stint at Wipro. However, I left that life for personal reasons and now find happiness serving good kebabs on the road.\u201d The brothers\u2019 food stall has extensive menu featuring half and full plate options. \u201cWe are aware of what others charge around here, and our prices are a bit higher, which is why we offer both half and full plates. But despite the higher cost, we know our quality is what draws the crowd,\u201d he added. Co-owner and younger brother Binoy, 24, explained their journey. They started the stall in 2019, \u201cafter watching a few YouTube videos on the success of street-food stalls in Kolkata. We used to work in the grocery delivery sector, but when online delivery apps began to rule the roost, we shifted to this business.\u201d It all started with biryani, but they soon realised that the growth potential with biryani was limited, and daily sales eventually plateaued. \u201cWhen we realised that biryani wouldn\u2019t bring in much profit, we conducted a six-month trial period with different kinds of kebabs. We gathered feedback from friends and family on what to improve before we finally started selling kebabs,\u201d said Akash. The COVID-19 period was another challenge for the Mazumdars, leaving them paranoid about the future. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much we could do during COVID; we kept opening and closing. Now, thankfully, we are at a stage where we are happy, with daily sales around Rs 16,000-17,000 until a month ago when, again, the hawker issue happened,\u201d Akash shared. The stall on Rajdanga Main Road attracts the most customers, but there are two other outlets as well \u2014 one opposite Howrah Bridge restaurant in Rajdanga, and another called Fry House opposite Ruby Phase 1. You can also order their kebabs online or over the phone. tried three items, starting with the  Fish\nFry priced at Rs 140. A large cut of fresh bekti, batter-fried instead\nof the classic crumb fry, was a refreshing change for us. It was served with  ,\na bit of mayo and onions. \u201cWe cut our own  , which is why we offer\ndifferent sizes of fries at varying prices. Since we don\u2019t buy pre-cut pieces,\nwe can price it according to our comfort,\u201d said Akash. Next up was the Achari Kebab, priced at Rs 150 for a full plate. This kebab with its tangy flavour is cooked in the tandoor to perfection. Akash explained, \u201cWe marinate all our chicken overnight. After much trial and error, we\u2019ve learnt exactly how long each kebab needs to stay in the tandoor, when to give it another coating of oil, and when it\u2019s ready to be served.\u201d When quizzed about the\nbestsellers and the brothers\u2019 personal favourites, Akash said, \u201cThe malai kebab\nand fish fry are our bestselling items and our favourites too.\u201d If you order anything\nfrom Apanjan Aro Beshi Kichu, be prepared to wait a bit, as everything is\nfreshly prepared. Kebabs going into the tandoor need at least 10 minutes to\nsoften, so allowing extra time ensures that you\u2019ll get well-cooked and tasty\nkebabs. Akash also shred their plans for the future of Apanjan Aro Beshi Kichu, and the next steps. \u201cRight now, our focus is on perfecting the kebabs and fries. We\u2019re grateful to our customers for their feedback because we believe in serving good quality items and are open to making changes. Our goal is to introduce a lunch menu soon and see how that goes.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "In our\ncontemporary, trend-driven restaurant landscape, where establishments mostly survive\na season or two, the success of Burma Burma, which is celebrating its 10 \nanniversary, is nothing short of a miracle. When childhood\nfriends Chirag Chhajer and Ankit Gupta \u2014 the latter with ties to Burma through\nhis mother who grew up there \u2014 decided to start a Burmese restaurant in India in\n2014, little could they have imagined that it would grow to be a pan-India\nchain of 13 outlets. It\u2019s heartening that they stuck to their guns and did not\nIndianise the flavours \u2014 and that the diners embraced the offerings with open\narms. But that\u2019s not even the craziest part. This is: Burma Burma is a\ncompletely vegetarian restaurant!  Cause\nenough to celebrate, and Burma Burma is doing it with \u2018The 10-Year Trail\u2019 special\nmenu. Featuring dishes from each of the seven regions of Burma, the menu is\nbursting with fresh flavours and healthy options. Think soups and salads,\nhearty mains, sumptuous desserts and refreshing coolers. The physical menu\nitself is like a little travelogue, with interesting bits of trivia about Burma\nand the featured dishes.  There\nare two soups to kick off the feast and, in the interests of investigative\njournalism, I ordered both. While the Tar La Baw is a broth of fermented\nand sun-dried bamboo, infused with pounded ginger and basil, red pumpkin,\nslow-roasted tomato and rice vermicelli noodles, and hails from the Karen\ntribal community, the Sarbuthi of the Chins is a soup made with a corn husk and\nshiitake broth as base, thickened with maize flour, with pickled mushrooms and topped\nwith a crispy corn fritter. While the former is light and aromatic, and\nbursting with umami, the latter is a heartier, more filling option. So take\nyour pick\u2014you won\u2019t be disappointed in either.   The Siman\nThoke salad, which comes from the Prom tribe in Burma\u2019s Shan\nregion, has to\nbe one of the star dishes on the menu. This is a salad made with shreds of\nchickpea tohu (a kind of Burmese tofu, and uncannily similar in texture to the Gujarati\nkhandvi) and raw papaya (making it a distant cousin of the Som Tam) tossed in a sour-and-spicy dressing \u2014 tangy and\nfilling at the same time.  \u201cA visit\nto my mom\u2019s hometown was how we stumbled upon this dish,\u201d says Ankit. \u201cIt was\non our way to the next destination (Shan), when we spotted huge queues of\npeople, waiting for their meal in front of an unassuming streetside hawker,\nwhich is how we discovered Siman Thoke; ever since then we\u2019ve been waiting for\na chance to feature it on our menus.\u201d In fact, each of the salads is stellar,\nincluding the Steamed Rice Tofu Salad, which has ribbons of rice\ntofu tossed with coriander and shallot oil, and topped with crispy garlic and fresh\nherbs, with just a smidgen of chilli to add some zing. Choosing\nsomething from the mains was tough, but I eventually settled for the intriguing\nHighway Meal Parcel. This comforting meal, typically wrapped in old Burmese\nnewspapers, is based around rice, and is a lunch staple in Burma. You will find\nit being sold at roadside stalls across Yangon. Burma Burma\u2019s version has\nsteamed rice topped with a lip-smacking mock meat and potato curry, with radish\npickle, cucumbers, mint and shallot salad, and mushroom chips for\naccompaniments. I\u2019m so glad one of my lunch companions ordered a Split Gill\nMushroom Fried Rice, which I was eyeing as well. The star ingredient in\nthe dish is the foraged split gill mushroom, which comes from the Kachin hills.\nA local delicacy, the mushroom resembles undulating waves of tightly packed\ncorals and is reputed to have medicinal qualities. Well, it\u2019s also delicious.  A word\non the drinks. They have some intriguing options, from the Durian Float (which\nI was too frightened to try, given the fruit\u2019s odious reputation) to the Chin\nGin Ley, a hibiscus tea and ginger-based drink inspired by the Rakhine region,\nwhich is arguably the best of the lot.  And then\nit was time for dessert. Some restaurants run out of steam by the time they get\nto this section, but not Burma Burma. The only conundrum is deciding which is\nbetter, the Burmese Milk Tea Cheesecake (Burmese tea-infused cheesecake, with a\nbrown butter streusel, stewed roasted apple confit, cinnamon ice cream, topped\nwith a cinnamon caramel and spiced tea tuile) or the Burmese Tropical Fruit\nPavlova (coconut chantilly with a tropical\nfruit salsa and mango gel, topped with a ginger coconut ice cream and mango\npassion caviar, encased in a crunchy coconut meringue, served with a mango\npassion fruit coulis). Or is it the Citrus Tea Leaf (tea leaf financier with a\nlemon fermented tea foam, kaffir lime curd with a honey chantilly, topped with\nhoney gel, almond streusel and citrus mango ice cream). Decisions, decisions\u2026\n(A word of warning, though: the dessert portions are quite large, so you might\nwant to share, however reluctantly.) According\nto Ankit, none of these dishes have been served in Burma Burma before. Burmese\ncuisine is the gift that keeps on giving, and I certainly hope some of them make\nit on to the regular menu. One of the best things about Burma Burma is that they\ndon\u2019t rest on their laurels. Instead, they invest in a lot of primary research\nwith periodic culinary forays into Burma. The 10-Year Trail menu is, therefore,\nalso a celebration of a decade of exploring Burma, and returning rich with\nexperiences and interesting new dishes for hungry diners who can never have\nenough.",

So, I decided that just putting together\nrecipes would not be the best thing and after talking to the publishers, we\nzoomed in on the idea of doing something on Onam, and the Onam  by\nitself is a very attractive meal. You have 20 - 26 items put on a banana leaf\nand there are a lot of traditions, science and Ayurveda behind the Onam  .\nThere were scattered books with recipes of the  , but nothing\nsubstantial on the festival or the  . So, about a year and a half\nago, I began the research into the festival, made a couple of trips to Kerala\nand spent all of Onam there last year. A lot of the\ninformation in the book was collected orally and I relied a lot on my own\nfamily, my own memories \u2014 scattered in bits and pieces here and there. Speaking\nto people like my aunt and other elders in the family, I was able to bring\nthese memories together and give a background to Onam and the  .  Every Onam was\ncelebrated together at our home in Bengaluru, until later when we shifted to\nDelhi, and a lot of my family had kind of dispersed. I was with my parents in\nDelhi, but we still made it a point to at least make the Onam  and\na  on Onam, and maybe get some new clothes. The tradition\ncontinued and when other siblings of the family were in Delhi, whenever\npossible we got together and did a  . So, the  was like\na constant. When I went to Bombay,\nI came back to Delhi a couple of times just for Onam. With friends in Bombay,\nwe would go eat somewhere that served  . But after that, whenever I\ngot a chance, I would cook a  , which I started doing for friends\nand family. I would do quite a few of the dishes and the family would\ncontribute a little bit and we would have a traditional  . So, Onam\nhas always been quite linked to this journey all through.  The  has certain\nbasic dishes. Accompaniments like chips, ginger curd relish, ginger tamarind\nrelish, and the pickle, are essentials in a  , along with a couple\nof  , and curries. So, I started from there.  I\u2019ve given options of\nmixing and matching to the readers so they can do a full  with\naround 20-plus dishes. You know, eventually a banana leaf has limited space.\nThere\u2019s no point in crowding it, with one dish touching the other and\neventually getting everything mixed up. So, you can pick and choose. I would\nsay a couple of the musts are  (mixed vegetables),  (mixed\nvegetables with coconut and curry leaves),   (vegetables cooked in\ncurd or buttermilk) (ash gourd curry) and  (pumpkin\nsabzi) and  (a rice and milk dessert similar to  ).  \n \nMy favourites are  and  , which is a  with jaggery with rice flakes.Then, in the chips, I guess, banana chips and\njackfruit chips. Also, for me,  (sweet-and-sour tamarind pickle)\nand (ginger relish) are again a must-try. I think there are a\ncouple of dishes which have ended up being not so traditional. This is\nespecially true in the use of vegetables. The  is the best example\nof farm-to-leaf (or plate). It was traditionally made with vegetables that were\navailable soon after the monsoon in Kerala like pumpkin, some root vegetables,\nand more. Fruits like banana and jackfruit are also available in abundance at\nthis time. When people start using vegetables like carrots and peas, and start\nadding stew to  , then it becomes a little bit of a mishmash. It\nwould be a  which means a feast, but it wouldn\u2019t be a typical Nair\nOnam  . Someone told me that they had gobi manchurian served to them\nat a  in Trivandram (Thiruvananthapuram), which is going a little\nbeyond.  What is the concept of\n ? People are introducing exotic vegetables like avocado and\nbroccoli, but these are not associated with Onam  . Seasonal and\nhyper-local ingredients are catchphrases we use today, but it is something that\nwe\u2019ve been doing for a very long time. It is in our tradition, but we have lost\nit somewhere. We\u2019re bringing it back to the centre table through this book. \nWhat the book does, apart from bringing Onam into focus, is give cultural and\nsocial backgrounds. The Onam   itself is not just a tradition, but a\nscience \u2014 it lies in the way the leaf is placed and the process in which the\nfood is served. When we start the  , we always insist that the\ntongue of the leaf has to be on the left of the person eating, and the sequence\nof the food served actually begins from this narrow side gradually expanding\ninto the broader side. So, we start with the salt at one end, and a sweet at\nthe other \u2014 just a teaspoon of each. Between this sweet and salty, we go\nthrough the five or six tastes that Ayurveda talks about. Each one of the\ndishes would give you an individual taste, and when you come to the middle of\nthe leaf, you get a mix of flavours. So, there is a science to it. \n\n",

To spread the joy of Onam,  got in\ntouch with chef Piyush Menon of the pop-up kitchen Coastal Macha in Jodhpur Park for some  recipes Born in Kota and brought up in\nBengaluru, Piyush Menon\u2019s family roots lie in Ernakulam in Kochi. He moved to\nKolkata in 2015 and began Coastal Macha, a restaurant at Gariahat. The  was one of the most popular dishes that attracted customers to the\nrestaurant during Onam. And even after the restaurant closed in 2020, Piyush\ncontinued with a pop-up/pop-out kitchen in Jodhpur Park under the same name and every Onam he\nmakes a traditional  \u201cThe  is a significant part of\nOnam celebrations. Last year I made mini   and it received an\noverwhelming response. At Coastal Macha, people used to ask for Onam  even\nwhen it wasn\u2019t Onam,\u201d said the chef. While the  had\nto be given a miss this year as the chef is busy with an upcoming  , he shared the recipes for Pineapple Pachadi and Kozhukkatta\n(jaggery stuffed rice balls) in sweet coconut milk that can be a part of your\nown Onam  at home. loosely translates to chutney in Malayalam.\nAccording to Piyush, while many people know of the different varieties of\ncoconut chutney, those are usually mostly served with breakfast dishes like\nidli, uttapam,  or dosa.\u201cThe Onam  is a lunch\naffair and the chutneys or  are made keeping in mind the other\nofferings. The pineapple  is a great accompaniment with rice as\nit\u2019s a perfect balance of sweet and tart, and has a kick from the  of\ncurry leaves and along with the flavour of pineapple.\u201d \n \nThis  -like sweet dish of rice and jaggery dumplings in sweet\ncondensed milk is a family recipe. \u201cIt is a traditional sweet served on Sundays\nby St. Thomas Christians or Syrian Catholics. This version, with the sweetened\ncoconut milk, is not traditionally served in Onam in a lot of places but I\npersonally love this  as it brings back fond memories of my\nchildhood days. It also resembles   from Bengal. My father is\nfrom Kerala and my mother is from Bengal and I always felt that this dessert is\na perfect marriage of two states!\u201d",

        "Article Content": "One of the most\nelaborate traditional vegetarian meals, the   (or  ) is\na mainstay of Onam celebrations. Traditionally served on a banana leaf, and\nwith the number of dishes ranging in double digits, it is also a unique\ncombination of flavours and textures.  In his debut book  (Bloomsbury, 2024) veteran chef Arun Kumar T.R. digs into the\nhistory, rituals and folklore around the Onam  With techniques and\nstories from a traditional Nair  kitchen \u2014 around which the chef\nspent his childhood \u2014 the book also has recipes for over 30  dishes. In the following\nexcerpt from  we look at the nuances behind serving and\narranging a  \u2014 which dishes are served from left to right, how to\ngo about eating a  meal, and more. Serving an Onam sadhya\nis quite a challenge, and one which goes beyond simply cooking the\ntwenty-four-plus dishes. If it is a family sadhya, confusion and chaos sets in\nfrom the moment you begin placing the leaves on which the meal will be served.\nShould the narrow tail end of the leaf be on the left or right? There is some\ndisagreement about this. The tail end should be on the left of the person who\nis eating. Sometimes you do not get leaves which have a tail and a head, they\nare almost rectangular pieces because they have been trimmed to remove the torn\nportions. In this case the leaf could be placed without bothering about left\nand right. This was just one of the problems I faced when I managed the first\nOnam sadhya at the restaurant I was heading. \u2026\u2026 There is science and a\nlittle bit of ayurveda involved. A sadhya is a balance of six tastes: sweet,\nsour, salty, bitter, pungent and astringent. They are all present, some\nsingularly and others in a mix. A sadhya is also a melody of textures, from\ncrisp to soft to watery. Here, putting together the science, ayurveda, textures\nand my observations from what I have seen and been told by the elders in the\nfamily, is a largely acceptable way to serve the Onam sadhya. Prior to inviting\npeople to sit for the meal, place the leaves with the tail to the left of the\nperson eating. The left corner is for all the accompaniments: a pinch of salt,\npickles, chips, a banana, ela ada/unniyappam and pappadum. Towards the right upper\nhalf put some pulli inji and inji thayir. Put a tablespoon full of payasam in\nthe lower, right-hand corner. Now, between these two\nends, running clockwise, comes the rest. After everyone is seated, begin with\nthe thorans, serving them in the upper part of the leaf, starting from where\nthe chips are placed. Below this put drier preparations like avial, erissery,\nkootu kari and kaalan. On the right-hand side serve the runny preparations like\ntheeyal, olan and pulissery. Leave the lower centre half for the rice. After the rice is\nserved, pour a few teaspoons of parippu followed by ghee. The meal begins with\nthat. Then comes the sambar. And the sadhya is on.  On the periphery of\nthe leaf, either above the centre or on the right, you could place buttermilk\nand rasam in tumblers or glasses. The payasam could also be placed in bowls\nnext to them. For the truly deft diners all this is served on the leaf.  What you have on the\nleaf is an array of tastes, flavours and textures, from the salty and pungent\nleft side to sweet and sour at the other end, with bitter and astringent in\nbetween. In fact, when you look\nat the narrow left corner, you would find it packed with all the tastes: salty\n(salt, pickles), sweet (banana\u2013jaggery chips, ela ada, (unniyappam), pungent\nand bitter (pickles), sour and astringent (pulli inji and inji thayir). In terms of texture,\nyou have the crisp pappadums and chips on the left, the firm but soft curries\nin the middle and the watery olan, pulissery and theeyal to the right. With all\nthis left corner, right corner, centre and the centre half, it sounds like a\nfootball match! Now everything is\nserved. But how does one eat a sadhya? Definitely with your hands, but in what\norder? Traditionally, as soon as you sit down to eat, the accompaniments would\nalready be on the leaf. Eat the chips, taste the pulli inji and inji thayir.\nPurists would check the payasam, a teaspoon of which would be placed along with\nthe accompaniments. There is a little controversy regarding the first course,\nwhich is the parippu with ghee. Crush a little pappadum into this. These days\nthe parippu is followed by sambar, but according to my aunt, Radha Thampuran,\nafter parippu you had the erissery, kaalan, avial, olan, pachadi and pulissery\nalong with the thorans. The last two courses before the payasams, according to\nher, were sambar followed by rasam. And after the payasams you had some rice\nwith the sambaram or buttermilk. Anything more on the leaf was eaten between\nthese dishes. These days, few people\nventure to have rasam or sambaram with rice as it is not an easy task to handle\nthese flowing liquids on the leaf. Remember to start with small quantities of\nrice. It is served continuously, as are the other items when required. There is\na way to indicate you do not want to be served more, by extending your hand,\npalms down, over the leaf. I have tried employing this constantly, especially\nwith liquid curries like olan, but I have been reprimanded by the person\nserving, asking me to remove my hand. The first serving of the dish cannot be\navoided. My idea was to have the chips on the left of the leaf, a little bit of\nrice served in the middle with parippu and sambar and get to the payasams. When the curries were\nserved at home, I would see my elders dipping a finger into them as they were\nserved and tasting them. Follow the elders and do as they do. It was exactly\nwhat we kids did when it came to consuming a sadhya. Step by step we followed\ntheir cues. If they took a bit of avial, we did the same. If they reached out\nto the olan, we did too. Purists would argue about the order of not just the\nserving of the sadhya but the order in which it is to be eaten: should the\navial come first or the erissery, should the theeyal be served or placed on the\nleaf; what about the pulissery? There is no end to the debate. Enjoy it the way you feel.",

        "Article Content": "Our\nfirst meal in Thimpu, the capital of the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, was a\nmemorable one at the luxurious Six Senses Thimpu, also known as the \u2018Palace in\nthe Sky\u2019. Situated high up on a mountain and surrounded by apple orchards and\npine forests, the hotel offers breathtaking views of the valley below through\nfloor-to-ceiling windows. The meal featured a special 48-hour sourdough bread\nwith knobbly Phobjikha potatoes in cheese, Hogay cucumber salad \u2014 slices of\ncucumber with local chillies and spices \u2014 a delightful red rice cold salad, and\nvegetable fried rice. Bhutan, the landlocked country in the Eastern Himalayas between\nIndia and Tibet, has different ethnic groups and its rich tapestry of food is\ninfluenced by the altitude, geography and local culture, as well as influences\nfrom its neighbouring countries like India, Nepal and Tibet.   Most Bhutanese dishes are eaten with red rice, called Gondomar, as\nwell as buckwheat or maize. Due to the cold weather, much of Bhutanese cuisine\nis comforting, featuring warm soups or stews known as Jaju, made with meat,\nvegetables, ferns, cheese, butter and lentils. Very often they have turnip\nleaves, which are harvested, sun-dried, and stored for use in winter. Fiddlehead ferns and foraged greens are a part of the diet, too. With many\ninhabitants of the region descending from Tibetans, this influence can also be\nseen in the food of the western regions. Tibetan noodles, such as thukpa, and\nsnacks such as momo dumplings can be found on local menus.  \u201cJust as Bhutan is dedicated to preserving traditional clothing\nlike the gho and kira, worn by men and women, it is also committed to\npreserving its culinary heritage,\u201d explained our local guide, Sithup. They pass\ndown ancestral knowledge and techniques from one generation to the next. \nTraditional cooking methods, such as using open fires and clay pots, are still\npractised in many households, especially in rural Bhutan. Southern Bhutan is home to the Bhutanese of Nepali descent. The\ntraditional food of this region is influenced by Indian and Nepali cuisine.\nRice and  are eaten with lentil stews, spicy curries and\npickles.  Zow Shungo, another one of the popular dishes of Bhutan, is\ntestimony to the sustainable approach of the Bhutanese. This is a dish usually\nmade from leftovers of vegetables and red rice with garlic, ginger and spices\nadded. \u201cLast night\u2019s dinner was converted into today\u2019s breakfast,\u201d said Sithup.\nNakey,  a popular street food that is made with puffed rice, peanut, and\nspices is found almost everywhere.  A staple of Bhutanese food is red rice, grown at high\naltitudes and known for its nutty flavour. Dairy is another cornerstone of\nBhutanese cuisine \u2014 butter and cheese are staples, made from cow, sheep or\nyak\u2019s milk. Cheese made from cow\u2019s milk is often used to make sauces. Hard\nyak\u2019s cheese, called Chhurpi, hangs in stalls like garlands, and chewing it is\na task in itself. Meat eaters have a lot on their plates, from yak meat to chicken,\nbeef, and pork, as well as a variety of dried meat dishes. Chillies are not\njust additions to a dish, very often, they are the main ingredients. Ema Datshi\nis the signature dish of the country \u2014 a traditional Bhutanese stew prepared\nusing hot chilli peppers and cheese (made from cow or yak milk), mixed with\ngarlic, water and oil. I taste variations of the dish, from creamy to\nbroth-like, including the use of green chilli, red chilli or organic sun-dried\nwhite chilli, with some people adding tomatoes, garlic onion, and spring onions\nor leeks as I travel from Thimpu to the east, to Gangtey, Trongsa, and finally\nBumthang and Paro. In the beautiful north-central valley of Bumthang, considered the\nspiritual heartland of the country, buckwheat is the star, as it grows easily\nhere. The region is also known for its dairy \u2014 Swiss cheese, started by a Swiss\ncheesemaker in the Sixties, butter and curd.  At Amankora, Bumthang, in the district capital of Jakar, at a\n16-suite lodge, chef Tshering Phuntsho, a fit cyclist and runner who comes from\nMongar in eastern Bhutan, said many of the dishes he served were inspired by\nthose made in his mother\u2019s kitchen. He served us a full rustic Bhutanese\ndinner, starting with a creamy roasted wheat flour soup with coriander,\nfollowed by Datshi Makhu \u2014 local farmer\u2019s cheese with ginger, garlic, sun-dried\nred chilli powder and Bumthang butter. A piquant mountain radish and local\npeppercorn curry with garlic and ginger followed. I found it interesting that\nwe were served a local rice mixed with polenta called Sharchop Kharang. I also\nloved his spicy version of Ema Datshi, made with whole sun-dried white chilies\nand yak cheese. Another staple, especially for vegetarians in Bhutan, is\nmushrooms. Gondo Datshi is a delicious local dish that combines mushrooms and\ncheese in a flavorful sauce. Jilli Namcho (wood ear mushrooms) is one of the\nmany mushroom dishes popular in rural areas. There are also chanterelles,\nmatsutake, and more, especially during mushroom season in late summer. We heard\nabout the annual Matsutake Mushroom Festival in Bumthang\u2019s Ura Valley, held in\nAugust, celebrating this highly sought-after mushroom, which is in demand in\ncountries like Japan and grows at altitudes above 9,800 feet. Over three days,\nvisitors taste, watch and participate in mushroom picking. Most meals are accompanied by strong and fiery Ara, a traditional\nBhutanese alcoholic drink, prepared by fermenting or distilling rice, wheat,\nmaize, millet, barley or buckwheat that is poured from beautiful wooden\ncontainers called Palang, adorned with brass decorations. Tea is the usual\nbeverage that locals like, especially the salty Suja \u2014 a churned tea made from\nyak butter and salt. Ngaja, a sweet milk tea similar to that found in India, is\nalso common. Another special home-cooked meal we enjoyed was at the rambling\nTamshing Farmhouse in Bumthang, where a mother-daughter duo cooked meals and guests\ncould interact with them and have a simple lunch. This not only empowers the\nwomen, but also gives visitors a chance to engage with local people. I watched\nthe matriarch stir a cheesy Ema Datshi in the large kitchen, with vessels\ndisplayed on shelves, while her daughter stirred local cow's cheese with\nchillies over the fire. We were served a hearty lunch that had red rice,\nbuckwheat pancakes, a creamy pumpkin curry, fried cheese, saut\u00e9ed green beans\nand Jambuley or Jangbuly flat noodles sprinkled with coriander leaves, onions,\nchilies and peppercorns \u2014 all accompanied by a shot of home-brewed Ara. Our best food experience in Bhutan was curated by Amankora Gangtey\nin the Phobjikha Valley, known for its potatoes and black-necked cranes that\nmigrate here from Tibet in winter. The meal took place in an old stone-built\npotato shed belonging to a local farmer, with 108 flickering candles arranged\non small stones along the walls and a musician playing the Bhutanese guitar in\nthe background. We were served a well-orchestrated, course-by-course bucolic\nBhutanese dinner paired with wine. The meal began with a delicious riverweed\nand egg soup called Jaju, followed by cabbage and cheese dumplings, Dolom Ngo\nNgo \u2014 saut\u00e9ed eggplant with onion and tomato, potato with glass noodle curry,\nand a delightful Shamu Ema Kam Datse featuring chanterelle mushrooms with dry\nred chilli and local farmer\u2019s cheese, along with local red rice. The fresh,\norganic flavours coupled with the ambiance made us feel transported to rustic\nBhutan, centuries ago. On my last day in Bhutan, I was delighted to find comfort food on\nthe menu at the Le M\u00e9ridien Paro, Riverfront, which offered beautiful views of\nthe river from its windows. From Kewa Datshi (potato with cheese and chilli)\nand buckwheat pancakes to a delicious Bhutanese fire-roasted pumpkin soup with\nchilli oil, I found happiness on my plate.",

        "Article Content": "The 1700s-built restored heritage hotel on the banks of Bhagirathi in Azimganj, Murshidabad, was our abode for two days when The Telegraph planned a special shoot for a vintage lookbook with the latest collection of traditional weaves from the Indian Silk House Agencies. Brother-sister duo Darshan Dudhoria and Lipika Dudhoria restored their ancestral palace and turned it into this opulent heritage hotel that specialises in treating guests to an experience of the Sheherwali culture by involving the local community. Our vintage occasionwear lookbook, ideated by taking inspiration from the women in the 18th and 19th century paintings of Raja Ravi Varma and Nandalal Bose, complemented the chosen backdrops of this 18th century heritage structure decorated with vintage artefacts. Incorporating traditional weaves like Benarasi, Kanjivaram and Patola, the looks styled in traditional Marathi and Bengali drapes twisted with inspiration from the paintings, created an overall elegant, vintage frame for each look with a dash of contemporary minimalism, creating a mood board of occasion-wear looks for modern women. 1. For this look in the balcony, the vibrant magenta and gold Rajkot Patola sari is worn with a traditional drape, teamed with a classic and elegant high, round-neck blouse with full sleeves, designed with hand-embroidered kundan lace border. The bun, bindi and neutral make-up complete the look. 2. Sana and Bitasta cut a glam frame depicting the looks of the bridesmaids. Bitasta channelled the glam with subtlety in a Kanchipuram sari with golden zari detailing from one corner to another. Sana complemented her look with a rose gold Kanchipuram sari designed with zari detailing. It is paired with a contrast yellow bridal Benarasi brocade blouse in a classic cut with embroidery highlights. It is draped in the Marathi style with a twist in the pleats. The pleats are kept broad in the front with a sweeping fall. Kohl eyes, nude lips, vermilion bindi and the hair left loose in waves complete the look. 3. White and gold as a combination embodies elegance and is trending as a preferred palette for occasion wear. Shot in the Gaddi Ghar, this shot has Meghna in a graceful frame in a milk-white Kanjivaram with broad zari border and zari work on the fall, worn in Marathi dhoti style with an uneven open fall. It is complemented with a golden blouse, glammed up with a bajubandh around the arms. Neutral make-up, with the hair worn loose in waves add to the simplicity of the look. 4.

The hair tied into a plaited bun, neutral makeup and small bindi complete the look. \u201cBari Kothi has always been patrons to the finest textiles, art and lifestyle.

Fresh make-up look on a nude palette, open curls and waves for the hair or gel bun and vermilion bindis were highlights of the looks for this shoot,\u201d said Abhijit Paul, make-up pro. \u201cThis shoot required a lot of background research. Keeping in mind the heritage and vintage look and feel of the property, we chose the colour palette for the saris. We chose saris that can be easily draped and draped it in Marathi dhoti style and traditional Bengali style. The drapes, hair and make-up were inspired by paintings of Raja Ravi Varma and Nandalal Bose. The accessories used were very different. We used traditional designs and a lot of thokai jewellery. We used tone-on-tone vintage and traditional style blouses complementing the saris. Excellent team work helped us to get this lookbook together,\u201d said Anupam Chatterjee, styling expert.

        "Article Content": "The last night of the year calls for gala celebrations. And, in equally joyful styles. Calcutta boy Surya Sarkar who breezed through town recently brought out a few of his edgy and statement styles for this special shoot at ITC Royal Bengal. We chose The Brass Room as our backdrop for a couple of shots, which \u2018pays tribute to Calcutta\u2019s heritage of jazz, blues and western music\u2019, a perfect complement to the red-carpet dressing that Surya showcased. The other photographs came alive against the lovely white facade of the EM Bypass address. Minimal yet striking was the mood with Surya playing around with the classic monochrome, a pop of a bright hue, only bits and pieces of accessories and a fresh look. Post-shoot, we caught up with Surya on homecoming and more.  It was an early morning flight and I spent 14 hours in the city. So this shoot was indeed very special for me. t2 is something I started my career with. Calcutta is just not home, it\u2019s a feeling for me. The rain-drenched Calcutta night is one of my most favourite memories of the city. I used to go for a drive from my home in Salt Lake to Park Street just to have ice cream. My childhood was spent in a very culturally rich environment, where this intricate art form called alpona caught my wholehearted attention from the beginning and today one of the most loved elements of the brand is inspired by alpona. My core sensibility itself is edgy and sexy, it always shines through my work. As a brand we are always evolving and upgrading with new techniques and technology. White\u2019s my most favourite colour. When it comes to dressing up in white or black, you can\u2019t go wrong. They are classic . As the festive season is here so we thought to showcase some classic looks with modern sensibilities. As for dressing up for this season, I always suggest \u2018you do you\u2019. No need to follow trends until you really love them. Wear anything with confidence. Pop colours are nice for this season. It lifts up the mood instantly. But make sure you go a little easy with your styling of any pop colour. An LBD for girls. Always. What can be better than some diamonds to style them with?! Corset. People are very health-conscious now and they work hard to maintain their bodies. And what\u2019s wrong if they want to flaunt it in some really cool corset?!",

        "Article Content": "If there are two people who understand how India eats, they are   and Sagar Daryani. While the former is a celebrity chef whose recipes have dazzled viewers in every Indian home, the latter has made momos a rage across the country with his brand, WOW! Momo. The Luxe Lifestyle Forum 2024 brought the duo together at Taj Bengal on September 4, for an interactive session on the ins and outs of the food industry.   brings you excerpts. Sagar started out by sharing that Domino\u2019s was his inspiration behind scaling to over 600 outlets in more than 50 cities. \u201cI thought that if they could convert a  -eating country into a pizza-eating one, and sell pizzas for Rs 300, why can\u2019t I charge Rs 100 for momos?\u201d he said, urging budding food entrepreneurs to dream big.   Ranveer also drew from his own past, advising people who wanted to enter the food industry to do it for passion. \u201cI decided to be a chef in 1992, not because it was amazing like medicine, engineering or the civil services. This is an industry driven by passion and belief, and you either go all in, or you don\u2019t,\u201d he said. Stressing the rates of spoilage and pilferage, he classified the F&B industry as a very high-risk space, with high chances of failure. \u201cI have closed more restaurants than I have opened. But if you believe that you\u2019re doing the right thing, you will succeed. Despite all the risks, you have to wake up each morning with the desire to do it all again.\u201d Sagar also urged food entrepreneurs to keep reinventing as they scale, given India\u2019s massively diverse demographic. According to Sagar, every city in India is like a country, and catering to multiple cities is only possible with constant learning. \u201cWhen we started, our fresh momos would spoil in four hours. Today, they last for three days without preservatives, only with the help of technology.\u201d For Sagar, the first step with a food business is to identify the cuisine gap in the market. With the \u2018WOW\u2019 brand, he began with a desire to restructure the unorganised \u2018  street food\u2019 market. The goal was to always give customers what they wanted. \u201cToday it\u2019s not difficult to understand the cuisine gap because of Zomato and Swiggy. Even now, whenever we open a new store in a new city, we speak at length to food delivery partners to understand the locality, what is the age group, the income level, and what kind of food is in demand. If you give what the customer wants, it will sell,\u201d he said.  Ranveer pointed out the other side of this, where people often get so obsessed with their product or dish that they start a business, without understanding whether there is a demand. \u201cThe product is only 20% of the game, while the rest is finding the product-market fit. You can have the best ingredients, presentation, or even taste, but if the customer doesn\u2019t want it, it won\u2019t turn into a business,\u201d he explained, emphasising on how the customer is king, and things need to be tweaked around their needs.  Ranveer also urged entrepreneurs to focus on creating value, rather than making money. \u201cThe food business is value-driven. We don\u2019t sell atta, dal or rice by the kilo. We create value with stories, connection, passion and emotion. Don\u2019t just prepare a dish, tell a story.\u201d Ranveer himself is known for telling the story behind popular Indian dishes on Instagram with reels that don\u2019t just add flavour, but emotion. He added, \u201cCooking, for me, is an expression, much like painting or writing poetry.\u201d  Sagar stated that his greatest achievement was the relationships he\u2019d built, while taking the company\u2019s strength to 6,000 employees. \u201cJob creation is the biggest impact for me. I want to take this number to 60,000 someday,\u201d he beamed. Ranveer concluded the session by saying, \u201c Even with nature, a seed is sown and it grows into a tree, to provide shade to others. The only joy of growing is to grow with others, and to give back.\u201d ",

        "Article Content": "Sienna Cafe sous chef\nAnkita Gupta Dujari was bitten by the travel bug very early in life. \u201cMy dad is\na hardcore traveller and he\u2019s taken us to almost every city and state in\nIndia,\u201d said the chef when talking to  about a recent trip to\n\u201cdream destination\u201d Ladakh. A self-proclaimed mountain lover \u2014 \u201cno one can\nconvince me otherwise,\u201d she said \u2014 Ankita made a pact with her husband Kaushal\nwhen they got married that they would have one trip to the mountains every year.\nAfter years in the making, the sought after Ladakh trip finally happened for\nthe couple in July this year, and it was all that she had hoped it would be,\nand more.  During the 14-day trip\nwith family, the chef ticked off many boxes on the travel wishlist, including a\nthree-day bike ride itinerary through the mountains and witnessing her first\nsnowfall. \u201cI\u2019ve travelled across India, seen all the mountains but never had\nthe chance to see snowfall. This time, I experienced my first ever snowfall at\nthe highest motorable pass in Ladakh \u2014 Umling La. I cried at the sight and\ndanced like a kid in Disneyland,\u201d she said. Of course, one of the\nhighlights of the trip apart from the scenic beauty was the food. Ankita really\nwanted to experience Ladakhi cuisine and spent two weeks sampling all that the\nregion had to offer.  Eating her way through\nthe local staples at Namza dining in on Zangsti road, in Leh, the chef\ndiscovered that the main food crop of Ladakh is barley, and it is often ground\nto make a flour known as  , which is used in a variety of dishes.\nThe barley also makes  \u2014 a beer-like fermented drink popular in\nthe region, while apples and apricots feature in abundance in the\nmarkets.  Padma Yangchan and her\npartner Disket, started Namza dining with the idea of reviving lost Ladakhi\nrecipes. As part of the trade routes connecting Tibet, Kashmir, Central Asia\nand Yarkhand, the region of Leh and Ladakh was a confluence of cultures and many\nof the dishes served at Namza can be traced back to the time of the ancient\nSilk Route.  Zathuk, a soup with nettle leaves, wild garlic\nand dry cheese; a savoury appetiser of steamed dough with a walnut-apricot\nsauce called Drapu; Kabra, tangy and nutty foraged capers that was served with\nthe flatbread Khambir; a hearty vegetable and meat soup with thumb-sized wheat\ndough balls called Skyu; Yarkhandi Pulao that was slow cooked for seven hours\nand served with a clear soup,  (momo), chutney and pieces of\nmutton. The Yarkhandi pulao\nwas one of the dishes that stood out for the chef. \u201cSucculent mutton pieces,\nperfectly cooked aromatic rice with the right amount of spices \u2014 I cannot\nforget that plate! My parents and I loved it! This pulao is considered the\n\u2018haute cuisine\u2019 of Ladakh which travelled through the ancient Silk Route along\nwith Yarkhandi traders who settled in Ladakh. And now it is one of the\ndelicacies to try when in this region.\u201d Chef Jagmeet Mingur\nwas a monk for about 20 years before he followed his love for cooking to become\na chef. \u201cHe started at Hemis Monastery, then lived at the Zhichen Bairo Ling\nMonastery in Nepal for several years before he went to a higher priest in Geshe\nla and then at the Diskit Monastery in Nubra Valley, he returned his vows and\nmoved on to follow his heart,\u201d said the chef. Mingur\u2019s journey with food took\nhim to Goa where he started as a dishwasher and then to Prana Cafe, until he\nwas brought back to Ladakh by the owner of Stone Hedge, a boutique property in\nNubra\u2019s Hunder Village. The monk-turned-chef\u2019s The Heritage Kitchen in Stone\nHedge, serves hearty meals with a mission to preserve the local herbs and\nculinary heritage of Ladakh. \u201cChef Mingur says he has to preserve it for the\nnext generation,\u201d said Ankita.  Ankita sampled their tasting menu which had\nTangthur, a buckwheat cracker, with yoghurt spiced with  or dried\nwild garlic chives; a barley flour soup called Nyamtuk; momos with a filling of\nturnip leaves, spinach, spiced with wild  and chives and served\nwith raw apricot chutney; Lettuce and Yak Cheese Salad with wild mint,\ndandelion leaves,  or liquid  cheese; Polda and Samik\nwhich had barley flour kneaded with yoghurt and served with hag saag; a pulao\ncalled Soshik made without the use of any masalas except  , along\nwith ghee and vegetables; a wild rose and wild goji berry tea called Shya that\nwas a palate cleanser; A root vegetable version of Skyu; Phaymar, steamed\nbarley dumpling with apricot jam and cream cheese; and on the side was some\nChamomile and Sea Buckthorn Kombucha. The standout dish here\nwas the dessert Phaymar, which was steamed barley dough balls that were\ncrumbled on apricot sauce and served with a side of cream cheese. \u201cUnlike the\nflour-based sweets that we make like halwa, which are sugary and made with\nghee, this had a unique texture and combined with the sweet-tart jammy sauce\ncreated an interesting flavour,\u201d said Ankita. The Turtuk region of\nLadakh has always been self-sufficient with a vast variety of food due to its\nagricultural community. \u201cFor the Balti community, summer is a celebration,\nthanks to their produce which is consumed in a nutritionally balanced cuisine\nwith grains like buckwheat, cheese, fruits and vegetables,\u201d said the Kolkata\nchef. The Balti Farm, started by Rashidullah Khan in 2020, aims to revive and\npreserve the culinary traditions and culture of Baltistan, which had become\nlimited to local homes.  The meal began with Chonmagramgrim, a crisp\ngarden salad with apple chunks and yak cheese. This was followed by Ba-leh, a\nsoulful soup with hand rolled noodles,  or tiger nut and dry\ncottage cheese; two kinds of buckwheat pancakes \u2014 Moskot, which was served with\na creamy walnut sauce, and Kisirnagrang-Thur, which were dipped in herby curd.\nThere was also Praku, a thumb-pinched pasta in a walnut sauce; Phading, which\nwere boiled and roasted apricots, apricot kernels flavoured with basil leaves\nand a side of Oosaa or mulberry\njuice. For pancake lover\nAnkita, the Moskot was her most favourite dish. \u201cI enjoy eating pancakes, and\nmake them often at home. But I have never made or tasted a walnut sauce before,\nand it has a nice nutty and caramel flavour which paired very well with the soft\npancakes,\u201d she said.   The first taste of\nLadakhi food has left the Kolkata chef impressed and she recommends everyone\ntry the cuisine. \u201cI just think everyone should at some point definitely try\nauthentic Ladakhi food. Chef Jagmeet told me that Ladakhi food is more like\nSattvic food, and has rich flavours but no heavy spices, which is why some\npeople tend to not enjoy it. But I think, it\u2019s a cuisine that\u2019s very light on\nyour stomach and if you are really into food you\u2019ll understand the depth of\nthis cuisine which is not much talked about,\u201d said Ankita. \u201cFrom hearty stews, to\nsucculent dumplings and mutton momos, and the aromatic Yarkhandi pulao, to a\nsoulful bowl of  \u2014 every dish was interesting and outstanding,\u201d she\nsaid. The variety of produce and the unfamiliar but rich flavour profile was\nsomething she \u201cabsolutely loved\u201d and wants to experience again and explore\nmore. ",

        "Article Content": "When the world around us celebrates this day with so much hype, it sometimes becomes almost impossible to turn a blind eye to all of it! So, for this V-Day, The Telegraph, through this special fashion shoot, gives ideas on how to soak up the celebration and make the most of it by spending the day doing things you love. From a pet lover lazing around with a pet in comfy co-ords and a bookworm\u2019s library date in a pair of smart flared pants with a fancy top to the foodie\u2019s evening out for a dessert date in a sassy dress and sealing the day with a pamper stop in the bathtub \u2014 it is all about making the day memorable with a splash of self-love. Actress Mumtaz Sorcar sports the looks in the internationally trending red to show the moods and talks to us about her story of self-love.  On Valentine\u2019s, we focus a lot on the partner and other things, but it is actually a celebration of love and love comes in various forms. It is not only about the partner and it shouldn\u2019t be about one particular day. Getting true love, unadulterated and unconditional is very rare. To get that eternal, true love one needs to be blessed and I am blessed to have people around me who unconditionally love me and that is the kind of love I want. For me, that love means family and I get so much of it that I don\u2019t think I miss anything from outside...\u201d \u201cAbove everything is loving yourself. We are always trying to impress someone else so much that we are losing ourselves in the process. We can\u2019t love others if we don\u2019t love ourselves. It is not easy. We need to learn how to do it. I think I am in a 50-50 state because there are times I have let myself down. But self-love is not being selfish, there is a fine line between being selfish and self-love. \u201cThe meaning of love hasn\u2019t changed for me over the years. Every person has their definition of love. For me, it should be unconditional and genuine. You don\u2019t have to try and love or force it. It has to happen naturally. The vibe is there. You don\u2019t need to try. But I see that the definition of love has changed all around. Times are changing, and now love is about swiping left or right!\u201d ( ) \u201cFor me, V-Day is going to be about self-love. We have to take care of ourselves. No matter who stays with us or doesn\u2019t, we have to stay with ourselves for eternity. The biggest teamwork is with yourself. I think I have cheated myself regarding self-love. But this year, I took a resolution  to not cheat on myself and it is going to be all about self-care and self-love.\u201d \u201cEating is definitely my expression of self-love (laughs). Being a complete foodie, that is definitely there. Me-time is all about food for me, not caring who thinks what or being conscious about how much I am eating. Listening to music, reading and being with my kids (pets)...but these are not just about one particular day, I do it every day. These are my batteries to charge myself. Life is all about the race now, it is very competitive and it is all about hard work, but at the end of the day it is always great to come back to people or situations that charge me up and make me feel good.\u201d \u201cI had a blast in the shoot. TheTelegraph did all the things that no boyfriend of mine did. So, I am very happy to feel pampered and taken care of. ( )\u201d",

        "Article Content": "Change, the only constant in the world, is not just a regular word but a force. And its Hindi translation Parivartan, headlining a sustainable event held at Daga Nikunj on February 11, aimed at re-establishing and reiterating the power of the word in bringing a substantial and much-required change to save the planet. This common objective of cooperative co-existence brought together Yogini Bapat, Shital Bhavishi, Janki Soni, Bhavika Popat and Somini Sen Dua to organise a landmark event that would start a new chapter in slow fashion. The daylong event in collaboration with Mrittika Earthy Talks and WICCI West Bengal saw a number of stalls selling products that follow the ethics of eco-friendly and organic with passion. The event was marked by talk shows on menstrual health, compost building, e-waste, organic vegetables and more that steered forward the dialogue of making result-oriented changes in daily life. A fashion show, Bohemia, by Dorji Shantiniketan, promoted slow and sustainable fashion. The concept of pre-loved fashion also joined the voice to cut down on fast fashion. The day was marked by a panel discussion that centred around the topic \u2018Is Sustainable Living the Answer to the Climate Crisis?\u2019 (R-L) Shruti Ghose of Garbage Free India, who is known for far-reaching initiatives of garbage segregation; Lata Bhatia, who has Calcutta\u2019s first zero-waste store and who also does workshops in composting; Ekta Jaju of SwitchOn Foundation; Nandan Mall of Hulladek Recycling; Somini Sen Dua, founder-director of Mrittika Earthy Talks Foundation; Surhid Chanda of Hari Mitti and Aveek Bhattacharya. Somini, who was moderating the panel discussion, talked about conscious living while Aveek focussed on sustainable fashion and natural dyes. The discourse also mentioned the importance of organic, chemical and pesticide-free food, creating urban kitchen gardens and more.   Somini Sen Dua said, \u201cParivartan is the change we are trying to include in our lifestyles. Climate change is a crisis now and we all agree on that. If we are still irresponsible we as a human race will not be able to survive. From the time we brush our teeth, to the packaged food we eat, and what we wear, we consume chemicals\u2026 we are the ones buying cancer and inviting it home! Statistics predict that fashion waste may increase to 148 million tonnes by 2030. It\u2019s time to live responsibly.\u201d One of the highlights of the day was the fashion show Bohemia by Dorji, Shantiniketan, which saw model Nick Rampal and owner of Bunaphile, Sonika Dey, walk the ramp among others. The brand is known for using natural dyes with products like seasonal flowers, indigo, leaves of trees and kattha (khoir). Stitched and designed by designer duo Sumon and Seyati, the designs are contemporary, trendy and chemical-free.  The daylong event exhibited a host of handmade and sustainable products from labels like Twirl, Ayurum Organics, Urvija, Paushtik Life, Rags to Riches, Bon Ap Pet It and more. It included attractive crocheted dolls, trendy and eco-friendly handbags that make a great alternative to leather ones, functional and multipurpose products made out of cane and bamboo, ceramic cutlery with beautiful prints and even eco-friendly jewellery made out of natural products.",

If I am dressed to go somewhere, I\u2019ll still wear something basic, but style it with accessories, like a nice bag. He (Mainak) is a perfectionist. He always has a picture in his mind. So does Diti. That is why the three of us work really well together. We are clear about the look in our heads. Diti\u2019s personal style is effortless.

Perfect holiday/ resort essentials: Summer mini and midi dresses, three- piece printed sets with bralettes, and oversized shirts, to name a few. : Kolkata has been one of our favourite markets from the start. The openness for experimentation in the local customers is really encouraging for an experimental brand like ours.

Perfect holiday/resort essentials: Co-ord sets are the trendiest and perfect holiday essentials at the moment.

We cater to both men and women. Perfect holiday/ resort essentials: For me personally, travel essentials would be a statement bomber, a fun co-ord set and a kaftan or day dress if it\u2019s a summer vacation. Coming to Calcutta: With KoAi\u2019s SS \u201923 collection called Coalescence. Coalescence means the joining or merging of elements to form one mass or whole. It is inspired by coppice, which means trees that are periodically cut back to ground level to stimulate growth. Unique prints have been designed by visualising coppice and integrating our classic printing techniques such as dabu, shibori and eco-printing. Perfect holiday/resort essentials: The perfect holiday essentials in terms of clothing depends on your destination, the weather and your personal style. There are, however, some general clothing items that are great for a holiday, like lightweight breathable clothing, a versatile dress, T-shirts and tank tops, comfortable shorts/pants, coverups/capes, comfortable walking shoes, sunglasses, swimwear, sun hat and light jacket or sweater. It\u2019s the sixth season of The Holiday Edit, and it\u2019s more experience-based than ever before. Every designer is telling a story, inspired by an emotion or a destination. The curation of designers is on par with global design language. Today, Indian designers are doing such fabulous work in westernwear that it\u2019s a pride to wear these designs on your travels. From embroideries to prints, to creating textures on eco-friendly fabrics, there\u2019s so much to offer. We have made sure that no matter where you plan to travel this year, there\u2019s something for you at this edit. From the \u201890s colour palette like bright neons, with the \u201880s silhouettes like mini skirts and flared jumpsuits, to Gen Z\u2019s aspiration for hype wear, we have tried covering all under the umbrella of this edit. I\u2019m particularly thrilled about fresh off-the-runway collections coming to Calcutta for the very first time, with us. And, that too with the designers themselves, it\u2019s the icing on the cake for all the holiday shoppers. I\u2019ve been trying to bring more labels that are following the sustainability norms of the industry, and most of these are. We also have a brand doing vintage jewellery that is pre-owned and thrifted from various luxury labels.  We have added micro experiences for people at this event. You can come and hang out at the gallery with women from the NGO under Humtree and make macrame products, sit and paint the walls, play crossword puzzles, and so on. In short, this season is more about feeling and less about retailing. And I hope the emotion of vacation and recreation will be reflected in the same \u2014 Chikky Goenka",

Traditions were at the core of their celebration as friends, family members and well-wishers gathered at the Ambani residence to bless the couple in their journey ahead. The engagement ceremony began with the traditional rituals of Gol Dhana and Chunari Vidhi that\u2019s followed down through the ages in the Gujarati Hindu families. Gol Dhana, literally meaning jaggery and coriander seeds, is a pre-wedding ceremony as per Gujarati traditions where these items are distributed at the groom\u2019s place. The bride\u2019s family visited the groom\u2019s residence with gifts and sweets, and the exchange of greetings and gifts was followed by the elders showering their blessing on the couple. The morning ceremonies concluded with a surprise performance by the Ambani family members led by Nita Ambani. The evening rituals started with members of the Ambani family led by Anant\u2019s sister Isha going to the Merchant residence to invite them. The Merchant family was received at the Ambani residence amidst aarti and chanting of mantras. The ceremony began with Anant and Radhika seeking Lord Krishna\u2019s blessings at the family temple followed by a Ganesh puja and the reading of traditional Lagan Patrika or the invitation to the upcoming wedding at the engagement venue. Isha Ambani announced the engagement ceremony creating a fun mood for everyone as the family pet dog carried the ring to the venue for the ring ceremony.

All the about 30 MLAs of the saffron party present walked out of the Assembly hall after Speaker Biman Bandyopadhyay disallowed a motion by them demanding that they be allowed to raise the issue of Mallick's suspension from the House in view of his arrest in a money laundering case linked to the ration distribution scam.   The motion was brought by BJP MLAs Shankar Ghosh and Agnimitra Paul among others two days after senior party leader Suvendu Adhikari was suspended for the entire winter session of the House after allegations that he made objectionable remarks against the speaker and created ruckus in the House.   In response to BJP leaders demands Bandyopadhyay said the issue cannot be discussed in the House.   Mallick was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a PMLA case linked to the ration scam on October 27.  \"The arrest of a people's representative and a member of the state cabinet in connection with a money laundering case has lowered the dignity of the House. We demand that unless the minister is proved innocent by the investigating agency and in the court, he should not be allowed to continue as a legislator,\" Ghosh said.  \"As no such step has been taken by the speaker and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee against Mallick even a month after his arrest, we demand the issue figure in the assembly,\" the BJP leader said.  Asked about the next move by BJP to press for the demand, Ghosh said \"We will step up our protests in different forms inside the House\" but did not elaborate. ",

        "Article Content": "He was hemmed in by the other four inside a Limousine with the glass separating them and the driver turned up. It was all too smoky inside. They were smoking. What? Never mind. Suddenly, while waiting at a New York traffic light, there was honking. Looking out the windows didn\u2019t help. The haze. So, one of the four turned down the glass to see who it was. Where are you going, asked a voice from a car nearby. We\u2019re going to Dylan\u2019s hotel. Want to come? I would have if I didn\u2019t have this recording session. Oh. Call us if you need a good rhythm section. The light turned green and off went the Limousine with all those on board, namely, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr and their guest for the day, Richard Alderson. Who is Richard? At that time in 1966, he was touring with Bob Dylan and The Band as a recording/sound engineer. That day, he had spent hours with the Beatles at Abbey Road studios watching them record a song from Rubber Soul. So, they all decided to drop him back at the hotel where Dylan was staying. The guy in the other car who didn\u2019t join them was Mick Jagger. And the one signing off with the rhythm section offer? Why, John of course. Close to 55 years later, when a pandemic has brought the world closer, Richard Alderson is on my Zoom screen, narrating this story that will be a part of his forthcoming memoir, which he plans to launch next year with an album he\u2019ll record with friends. Some of the songs in Backbone will be his own, reflecting on the material he has recorded from behind the console for over a lifetime. His recording credits, easily over a thousand albums, include legendary performers ranging from Nina Simone, Bob Dylan and Harry Belafonte to Grover Washington Jr, The Fugs, Pearls Before Swine and Roberta Flack. Seriously? Yes. \u201cNina was an incredible talent. She had a whole genre to herself. And she is unique. Nobody else is like her,\u201d sums up Alderson. \u201cAnd Harry, I loved the musicians in his band. And I loved what he stood for.\u201d As for Dylan, the soundman is crystal clear. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest songwriter ever.\u201d Jaimin Rajani, a Dylan die-hard who scripted the documentary, If Not For You, on Calcutta\u2019s oneness with Bob Dylan, joins our screen session, egging on Alderson to revisit the day at New York\u2019s Gaslight caf\u00e9 when the singer-songwriter performed Hard Rain for the first time. That day, was he in sync with music\u2019s seminal moment? \u201cI always felt it was a very important moment. But the world didn\u2019t see it that way as far as I could see. I didn\u2019t know whether Dylan was going to change the world, but I knew it was wonderful. And it did change the world,\u201d avers Alderson. Yet, what about the tours with The Band, the booing, the seeming anger at Dylan going electric? \u201cI could never understand why they booed. Bob and The Band would do a magnificent performance of a song and the audience booed after that. I could never understand that because it sounded wonderful,\u201d Alderson says, sounding as befuddled as the members of The Band did at the time. Robbie Robertson provides another insight in his book, Testimony.  After all, he was there on stage with Dylan. \u201cIndividually they didn\u2019t seem offended by the music; it was more of a mob mentality _ \u2018When Bob Dylan goes electric, you boo.\u2019 I saw it, and I got it. From that moment the cheers and the jeers no longer affected me,\u201d he writes, later describing how after the shows Dylan would tell them they were great and that they would play even louder the next time. Deep down, Alderson reveals that he had always thought of Dylan as a rock n\u2019 roll man. Hence, Dylan moving to electric, to him, was not surprising in the least. \u201cIt was a perfectly natural progression for me that he should move on to an electric band. And he started off as a rock n\u2019 roller. He had a band in Wisconsin while growing up that was a rock n\u2019 roll band, and that\u2019s where his enthusiasms were. But at the time when he began, which was in the early \u201960s, folk music was the only structure that was there where he could express the kind of things that he expressed. And he quickly turned to rock n\u2019 roll which is where his love is\u2026 and classic three-chord rock n\u2019 roll remains his basic thing.\u201d Which brings us to his latest, Rough and Rowdy Ways. \u201cI think (it) is magnificent\u2026 a really wonderful record. It doesn\u2019t have much exploratory music on it. It\u2019s very simple music, but complex emotionally. And I know the band leader, the bass player, Tony Garnier, who has been with Bob for almost eight years, longer than any other musician ever.\u201d Alderson\u2019s dreamy eyes light up while talking about the music of George Harrison, especially his use of Indian musical motifs, and Nina Simone, the classical piano virtuoso, who took to singing and playing like no other. \u201cI love Harrison\u2019s interaction with the music of your country. And I love Ravi Shankar who was a synthesis player anyway\u2026  I love those songs of Harrison where he\u2019s greatly influenced by Indian music,\u201d he says. With Nina Simone the connection is personal, having recorded several of her albums. In Nina At The Village Gate, released in January 1962, you can hear Alderson, who was then the live sound man at the Greenwich (New York) nightclub, announce her arrival on stage. He did not record that album but went on to engineer many others with her. They shared an excellent rapport, something many find difficult to believe, given that Nina was known to be a difficult person, an impression that seems to have been partially reinforced in the documentary, What Happened Miss Simone? The Netflix presentation, for which Alderson was a consultant, also showcases some of her most electrifying performances along with her involvement with the civil rights movement. \u201cThe point of view of the documentary which I differed from was how difficult she was and how unstable she was as a human being. And I didn\u2019t figure into the picture. Al Schackman (guitar), who remains my good friend, was the talking head in that and he was with Nina all of his life,\u201d he says emphasising that both he and Al shared an excellent relationship with her. \u201cI never wanted to start a fight with anybody, least of all Nina Simone. I had too much respect for her and I knew she was a very erratic personality and a very unpredictable person. But her talent overruled everything.\u201d As a record producer and engineer, Alderson is surprisingly candid, and accommodative, on the question of sound quality in the era of Spotify and iTunes. \u201cThe best quality is represented by vinyl recordings unquestionably,\u201d he declares, as if to get that universal truth out of the equation. \u201cSo, given everything, if you have superb equipment and a great vinyl record, it will sound the best.\u201d  Yet, even as he declares his total commitment to good quality sound, Alderson admits that compressed audio, the kind available on streaming services, are wonderfully convenient. Also, considerable improvements have been made in compression technology and the algorithms. \u201cI mostly listen to compressed music, which by the way is better than ever. They have found many ways to improve it. At first it sounded really a shadow of the original. But now it sounds very much like the original.\u201d Well, there you have it, audiophiles, take a deep breath. Relax. That was from someone who knows. The pandemic has tricked many into believing that there may be more than 24 hours in a day. Alderson agrees it has given him more time to finish his book and then get working on the album. His tryst with the Beatles at Abbey Road, where he saw Paul McCartney play the drums but can\u2019t remember to which song, is yet to figure. \u201cI am only up to 1962 and this happened in 1966,\u201d he says. Alderson has an impressive line-up in mind for the recording of Backbone, which will be helmed primarily by Al Schackman. \u201cI have written a few songs\u2026 The songs represent, in part, what I recorded. Everyone will be part of it, including Dylan\u2019s bass player Tony Garnier, keyboard player Rob Mounsey and a drummer who appeared on more pop recordings than any other drummer that you\u2019ve ever heard of. And I also intend to bring in Bill Eaton, who was Belafonte\u2019s and Aretha Franklin\u2019s musical director. He\u2019s an old friend.\u201d  Alderson doesn\u2019t want to delay any further. \u201cI am 83. The youngest in the band is in his 60s.\u201d  Ready? Take One. Let the music play.",

        "Article Content": "He was there when Bob Dylan stunned the music world and played electric guitar at the hallowed precincts of the Newport Folk Festival. He was tour manager for The Band and helped build a studio for Messrs Robbie Robertson and Co. at Woodstock at a funky house called Big Pink. It was at his home that George Harrison ideated the historic Concert for Bangladesh. Then he got into movies and started off by producing one of Martin Scorsese\u2019s early gems,  . He went on to executive produce  , the seminal concert film that marked the closure of The Band\u2019s touring days. A Princeton alumnus, he has also studied Big Tech in detail, having had an early brush with the world wide web when he launched the Internet\u2019s first video-on-demand service in the 90s. He has been professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism from 2013 to 2016. He is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and currently sits on the boards of the Authors Guild, the Americana Music Association, and Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti\u2019s Technology and innovation Council. He is now director emeritus of the USC Annenberg Innovation Lab. Meet Jonathan Taplin, a technology watcher _ \u201cMove Fast and Break Things\u201d, his first book _ music and film buff, who was in his early years delightfully na\u00efve, and hence didn\u2019t think twice about putting his own money in the movie business. He is all heart when it comes to making life choices. At the moment he is on a virtual roll, talking about his new book that chronicles his life, marked by luck, good timing and impeccable instincts. \u201cThe Magic Years, Scenes from a Rock-and-Roll Life\u201d, published by Heyday Books, is described as both a \u201crock memoir\u201d _ he rubbed shoulders with the likes of Jerry Garcia, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and many other icons _ and a cultural critique underlining key moments that tries to explain the modern world\u2019s tumultuous trajectory. Music, movies and Big Tech. I caught up with Taplin, a \u201cthree-in-one\u201d walking, talking encyclopaedia and keen observer of popular culture, over Zoom and ferreted out priceless nuggets about George Harrison, Bob Dylan and his time with The Band, Martin Scorsese, and above all, try and get a sense of art\u2019s power to jolt us out of \u201cpassionless detachment\u201d and resurrect our innate \u201chumanism\u201d. George Harrison had come to New York to make the record (late 1968), All Things Must Pass. And he was making it with Phil Spector. On weekends sometimes, he would come up to Woodstock to visit Bob Dylan, Robbie Robertson and The Band. And sometimes, he would stay at my house and sometimes he would stay at Bob\u2019s house. ? Yes. Later, I met George in 1969 when we had gone to do the Isle of Wight (music festival, Newport, England) and he had invited me to his house. And I had stayed with him and Patty (Boyd) for a couple of days after that. One night in the spring of 1971, he said, \u2018Ravi Shankar says that there is a complete crisis going on in East Pakistan. And nobody is aware, what\u2019s going on\u2019. And Ravi said, \u2018We have to help these people. We have to get money in there \u2019cause people _ and a lot of children _ are literally dying everyday of starvation\u2019. So, George being George said, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s do it.\u2019 He said, \u2018How do we do this?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it in the biggest place we can get\u2019, which is Madison Square Garden. Because we have to make as much money as we can. And I said we could probably do two shows in one day, and you could fill all 17,000 seats twice. And at a decent ticket price, you could make some real money. The next day, we all went down to Allen Klein\u2019s office, who was the Beatles manager at the time, and booked Madison Square Garden for two nights; the last day of July we would use to set up the stage, sound system and do a sound check; and then Sunday, the first day of August, would be the two shows. George just got on the phone and started calling people. And not a single person he called turned him down. We got Ringo (Starr) and Klaus Voorman (bass player and Beatles\u2019 friend from Germany), Jim Keltner to be a second drummer, Leon Russel to play piano and Billy Preston to play organ. So that was the basic band. And Eric Clapton was going to be the lead guitar player. So, that came together fairly quickly. And then he got Bob Dylan. And then it just became something very real. It was remarkably fast in the way that it came together. I think we announced that it was going to happen in late June. And the concert happened in August. Yeah. It accomplished two things, one of which was that it did actually raise awareness. Nobody (in the western world) had ever heard of Bangladesh before that concert. And afterwards, everybody, including politicians knew about Bangladesh. It raised at the beginning, maybe half a million dollars. Then, there was the question of how we could get that money to the people. And eventually, it was decided that we would just give it to Unicef. Once the record came out and then the DVD, the video of the movie and the video of the making of the movie, I think it probably raised 20 or 30 million dollars for Unicef over the years. So, it accomplished two things: it raised a lot of money and raised awareness. And raising awareness was at the time even more important than raising the money. Yes. The Newport Folk Festival was a kind of hallowed ground for folk music which was this \u201csacred\u201d thing. And there were lots of people like Pete Seeger and Alan Lomax whose job was to protect this tradition and try and make this music available to a lot of people. Somehow Grossman got a band called the Paul Butterfield Blues Band invited to the festival. Grossman was managing Paul Butterfield too. And Butterfield played a workshop in the afternoon at the same time that Lomax was doing a country-blues workshop. And Lomax really objected to the whole thing and tried to literally unplug the electricity. And Grossman got into a fight with him (Butterfield). I was with a guy named Geoff Muldaur who was a singer in the Jim Kweskin Jug Band who was also managed by Grossman. We went back to the artistes\u2019 tent and Muldaur told everybody the story of this fight between the old guard Alan Lomax and the new wave Paul Butterfield, and Dylan listened to it. And I am just speculating now that Dylan told himself, \u2018Screw it. If that\u2019s going to be their attitude, well, I am going to play rock and roll too. He already had a record on the radio at that time, Like A Rolling Stone, and so, it wasn\u2019t that he had never played rock before. He had played it for a while, but he had never played it on stage. So they kind of very quickly assembled a band with Mike Bloomfield who\u2019d played on Like A Rolling Stone and The Butterfield Blues Band rhythm section and Al Cooper who was an organ player. They just put it together very quickly, and it was pretty rough. But that\u2019s how it came to be. But people booed and rejected it outright. Bob did a tour of England in the spring of 1964. Bob was staying at the Savoy Hotel in London and he and John Lennon used to hang out every night. I think Dylan was introducing John to smoking hashish and also took other intoxicants. They were exchanging songs. And if you think about that, the distance from say,  and to   on Revolver, is only about 16 months. But I would argue that Lennon being exposed to Dylan\u2019s work changed him a lot. And in the same way, it also changed Dylan to see the fun that the Beatles were having playing rock. He wanted some of that fun too. I mean, everything had been so serious (till then). Right, exactly (laughs) Yeah, I think so. I think maybe John Lennon could have had a solo career as a musician, and certainly Paul McCartney, and may be even George (Harrison). It\u2019s probably hard to imagine that any one of The Band members could have had a solo career by themselves. But when they all got together, something magical happened. It really worked. And also makes me think about the very nature of being in a band. It\u2019s very hard, right? I mean one of the themes of my book is that it\u2019s hard to keep a band together. The Beatles survived for a certain number of years, but then it came apart because of personalities. And certainly, the Eagles had the same problem. But it happened to The Band as well. At some point it began to wear everybody out. I\u2019ve grown up in a kind of liberal background in America and I had been involved in the civil rights movement from 1963. In that sense, the notion of the White southerner was very much to me a problematic character in American history. And then, I came back from college and headed out to California where we set up this recording studio for The Band to make their second album. And they brought me down to this studio and played me  . And it was a very emotional feeling. In other words, I was kind of overwhelmed by it. And for the very first time in my life, I had a sense of the wounded pride of that character in that song. In other words, it was able to make me rethink what I was thinking about the role of the poor White person in the South. I thought it was a really powerful experience. I was crying at the end of the song. I mean it moved me very deeply. And it made me able to rethink things. It certainly helped me understand Levon a lot better who was from Arkansas from the deep South. I got a sense of his people. His father was a dirt farmer, very poor. All of The Band had kind of struggled out of rural parts. Rick Danko\u2019s father chopped wood for a living. So, I mean, the song was about Levon in a sense, but it was all about any kind of poor working class person and the struggles they go through. The Band and Bob Dylan had a period, which we now call the Basement Tapes, in which they were completely out of the spotlight. Bob was recovering from a motorcycle accident. The Band was just kind of up there in Woodstock. They were still known as The Hawks and they just started experimenting with music. It started out as a way for Bob to put down some new songs that he\u2019d written so his music publisher could send out a tape to other musicians who might want to record those songs. It wasn\u2019t really meant for anything except as like a demo tape. So out of that time, which was months and months, using a little two-track recorder that Garth (Hudson) had set up in the basement of this little funky house called Big Pink, they began to create a different kind of music. Now, we call it Americana. It\u2019s actually a genre. But the idea of Americana didn\u2019t exist then. For Bob, it was the return to some kind of folk roots that he had left behind. For The Band it was like an education in a kind of old-time music of America that came out of folk and bluegrass and these other traditions that they hadn\u2019t really been aware of. They were really a rock and roll band, right? And they were very aware of Elvis and Carl Perkins and Muddy Waters and Sonny Boy Williamson. But they weren\u2019t really aware of that other kind of Carter Family, Johnny Cash kind of world. So that was a very interesting thing. And out of that songs like   came. And then Robbie kind of took some of that internally and he wrote   which is very much in that same tradition. So, I think the combination of The Band and Bob was really amazing. Yes, in the earlier times you speak of, they provided Bob a kind of spirited way of playing rock and roll music and marrying it with the poetry that he had always written. It was quite remarkable. Yes, they got booed around the world, but a few years later in 1969, when Bob and The Band came back to the Isle of Wight to play, they played the very same music that they\u2019d played in 1966 and got booed at, and everybody loved it. Time had healed the wounds. I don\u2019t know what had happened, but it was totally changed. And then in 1974 they played it, did a tour all over the United States and it was the same thing, people just loved it. Yeah, I did. When I saw Bob go electric at Newport, I realised that it was amazing. I was convinced that that was an extraordinary moment. But I didn\u2019t understand the import of it in the larger scheme of things _ which is that something major had happened to break between rock and roll and folk music. I didn\u2019t know how important it was. But I knew it was big. I knew it was kind of an earthquake. It could be that in India people experience a sight of 350,000 people in one place for some festival. But in the United States, we never saw that. So, when we came over this hill in this helicopter and you saw this gigantic crowd it felt like a Cecil B. DeMille movie. It was pretty dramatic. I had never seen anything like that and I haven\u2019t seen anything like that since. Look, Levon later on kind of got angry about the fact Robbie was doing better than he was financially. And that is strictly a factor of Robbie having written a lot of the songs. In fact, he wrote a majority of the songs that The Band performed. And after 2000, when Napster came out, the value of the actual master recordings, i.e., what the musicians would get from selling records, went way down. But songwriters continued to get paid because they had these collective performing rights organisations, BMI and ASCAP, which ensured that if a store is playing music in the store it has to pay some money to the songwriter. If a bar is playing music in that bar, it has to pay money to the songwriters\u2019 organisation. So, songwriters kept getting/collecting money, and the musicians who played on the record didn\u2019t get anything. This got Levon very pissed off. But, I mean, the honest truth was that Levon didn\u2019t write any song. And so, he then kind of took a view that the whole thing,  , was only there to make Robbie look good, and that Robbie and Marty (Scorsese) were in a kind of conspiracy to push Robbie forward. I don\u2019t think it was true. And by the way, those interview segments in which Levon talks about the South and everything actually got Levon acting gigs in   and   and all sorts of things. I mean, he benefitted as well. But you know, 2020 hindsight, it\u2019s hard and sad. I am sad that Levon was angry. But I think   holds up. I looked at it recently, and it\u2019s very good. And almost every single musician who played on it, played at the top of their game in that film. I mean Van Morrison is just amazing. Muddy Waters is amazing. By late 1972, I was just kind of tired of the whole thing. I had done   and that had been successful. Then we\u2019d done  which was a very successful live recording for The Band. And so, I went out to California. And Jay Cox, who had written a cover story on The Band for Time, told me, \u2018When you get there, look up a kid named Martin Scorsese. He edited Woodstock and he\u2019s a total rock and roll fan. And you guys will like each other as you have a lot in common\u2019. So, I got to LA and got in touch with him, and he came over to visit me at my house in Laurel Canyon. He brought a script with him called, \u2018Season of the Witch\u2019, that he\u2019d been trying to get made for three or four years unsuccessfully. And I was so na\u00efve, I didn\u2019t know you weren\u2019t supposed to put your own money into movies! In Hollywood they have a phrase, \u2018OPM\u2019 or \u2018other people\u2019s money\u2019. But I didn\u2019t know that phrase. I went to see Marty\u2019s student films. And I really liked them. So, I just took a chance. I got a friend who had some money and we each put $250,000 which was basically all the money I had in the world. And we took a chance. Again, it was a complete na\u00efve, and probably stupid, move. But fortunately, Marty made a great movie. And we were able to sell it to Warner Brothers and we got our money back.   Brave or stupid? Yes. I always follow my heart. Sometimes the heart takes you to places that you realise are not so great. And sometimes, you\u2019re in places that are just amazing and wonderful. But the main thing is not being afraid of change. It took me about a year once I started working on it seriously. I have a very good memory (laughs). In fact, I remember more from the 60s and 70s than I do from 5 weeks ago (laughs). Bursts out laughing. Thank you. It was lovely talking to you.",

        "Article Content": "So what\u2019s he up to, this Bob Dylan? Days ago he was spotted, apparently shopping for Christ\u2019s sake, running errands in Los Angeles, where he has been cooped up ever since his scheduled concerts for the never ending tour got cancelled because of a damn virus. The May sighting, weeks before his May 24 birthday, was the first since 2011, and naturally they were all excited, speculating about his gait, his combat boots, his navy short-sleeved shirt and a piece of jewellery that looked like a wedding ring. Something\u2019s happening here and you don\u2019t know what it is, do you, Mister Jones? Well, there are three new books out to commemorate his 80 years in the business of writing and singing songs, switching instruments, altering voices, painting America in all its daylight splendour, sporting varying hats, a pencil thin moustache to boot, and, along the way, sell some whiskey. Heaven\u2019s Door he likes to call it. Then they gave him the Nobel. Good lord, he said, and dodged the committee for days; he didn\u2019t join the august ceremony _ poor Patti Smith choked while singing  for him. And close to deadline, he finally accepted the $900,000 prize money and on June 4, 2017 recorded his Nobel lecture, reflecting on the influence of literature on his songs, referencing some of his favourite books and dwelling on, at length, on Moby Dick, All Quiet on the Western Front and The Odyssey. Many say he side-glanced at the CliffsNotes study guides while preparing his speech. Knowing him, and the great fibber that he is, he just may have. Last year, he sold the rights to his back catalogue to Universal Music for an estimated $300m. Meaning, he doesn\u2019t own  anymore. Earlier, an American philanthropist billionaire helped establish the Bob Dylan Archive in Tulsa, spending a neat $20million to buy his junk, essentially old master tapes, photographs, drawings, hand-written or typed set-lists and at least one leather jacket, reportedly the one he wore at the 1965 Newport Festival when he went \u201celectric\u201d to scandalise the folk establishment and light a match under the seats of an unprepared music world. They\u2019ve also lined up a series of events, as many as seventeen, with Italian scholars, American academics and biographers to untangle the Dylan mystique with brain-numbing intellectual heft. Good luck to them. It\u2019s fitting though that the Dylan Archive sits beside one dedicated to Woody Guthrie, set up by the same foundation, in loving respect for one of folk music\u2019s earliest heroes and Dylan\u2019s major influence. He started off singing about the road, asking questions, answering them. He wrote paeans about love, desire, loss, about colour and conscience, about history, religion and memory; and had fun playing the harmonica. In between, he sung for the Pope, hawked his songs for commercials, and sang about Noah\u2019s Ark while dishing out dire warnings like, \u2018You\u2019ve Gotta Serve Somebody\u2019, but inexplicably and agonisingly dropped sparkling gems like  ,   and   from their intended showcases. He covered the Great American Songbook _ of Cole Porters and Sinatras _ talked about them in a fascinating series of radio shows and ended up with a 17-minute story poem on the Kennedy assassination. Something\u2019s happening here and you don\u2019t know what it is, do you, Mister Jones? Funny thing is he\u2019s laughing all the way. Good for him. He has difficulty playing guitar these days. Arthritis. But piano it is. Bless him. We still sing  , all the while believing that even though he\u2019s strumming about himself, it is you and me he\u2019s talking of. Perhaps   harbours the only truth there is. Mr Jones did find out. There are no back pages for Bob Dylan. The pages keep turning, fluttering in the breeze at dawn, through every passing day and at night.",

        "Article Content": "When Bob Dylan won the Nobel prize for Literature in 2016, he was the first recipient ever to win on a day he was scheduled to play a gig _ Las Vegas. The Swedish Academy announcement said he won \u201cfor having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\u201d. Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, added Dylan had been chosen because he was \u201ca great poet in the English-speaking tradition\u201d and that he can be read and should be read. \u201cFor 54 years now he's been at it reinventing himself, constantly creating a new identity,\" she told reporters in Stockholm.   Dylan, who had kept the academy guessing about his acceptance for quite a while after the announcement of his winning was made, ended up recording his Nobel Lecture on June 4, 2017 in which he explored the nature of relationship between his songs and literature. He mentions three books in particular _ Moby Dick, All Quiet on the Western Front and The Odyssey _ the ones, he said, stuck with him since grammar school. His conclusion is telling in the way he expresses his deep attachment to The Song. \u201cOur songs are alive in the land of the living. But songs are unlike literature. They\u2019re meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeare\u2019s plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, \u201cSing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "You hear hints of her playing just before the foot-tapping urgency and beat-bouncy feel of  kick in. What is a soft incantation at intro of the first track of Bob Dylan\u2019s album Desire morphs into an emphatically searing solo in the politically charged song about the incarceration of boxer Rubin \u2018Hurricane\u2019 Carter, who went on to becoming a telling symbol of the civil rights movement in America. She comes in with equal finesse in the next song,  , but this time gently playing over his harmonica. What\u2019s going on? But hey, it works. Wonderful. Listen on. There she is again in  , coming ever so strongly soon after in  . The mix is heady. The flavour intimate. She is all over the song. Teasing, loving, then suddenly distant; only to sweep down like a bird of prey and then soar into the skies again. By the time we are at  , love is a palette of colour. Stark brush strokes, she is now playing over his harmonica. Loud. Clear. She has pierced your soul. In a nice way. Nobody knew Scarlet Rivera up until then. \u201cI believe I opened the door for many other violin/string players who hear and do things differently,\u201d she says about her unlikely foray into rock stardom four decades earlier. A shy, rebellious girl, who thought nothing of being thrown out of an orchestra for playing a prank on her conductor, she used to be a deeply private person only willing to give herself to music. It\u2019s a miracle her path crossed, literally, with that of Bob Dylan. Today, 45 years after the bestselling Desire was recorded, Scarlet confirms what is now part rock legend, albeit with some crucial amendments _ Dylan did not smile, talk or do anything to indicate approval the first time she played for him, that came hours later on that eventful day when he took her to a Muddy Waters concert; prior to her ultimately joining the band, recording for Desire had already begun; the band that was helping Dylan cut the album, which included a guitar superstar, was asked to leave after her place was sealed; and that she was the first to use paint on her forehead during the Rolling Thunder tour that Dylan launched soon after wrapping up  recording Desire, and, therefore, may have been the catalyst that got him to smear white paint on his face with dark eyeliners during the show _ she doesn\u2019t even mention the Kiss concert which she purportedly took Dylan to from which  he is said to have got the idea. \u201cIt was written in the stars that we should meet,\u201d she tells   in an exclusive and expansive conversation over Zoom from her apartment in Los Angeles over a fortnight ago. \u201cI think it would take a whole chapter to really describe it, because, what happened in my life and what made me who I was at the time is the reason why that date with destiny happened.\u201d Hence, first things first. We know she, then in her mid-20s, was on way to rehearsal in East Village, New York City, with violin case in hand when the miracle unfolded.  \u201cAs I was walking down the street towards that apartment, I sensed a car was trailing me. And then, at some point, I was about to cross the street, it cut me off, and he insisted that we talk. He wanted to know about my playing, and if I could play. I said, \u2018well, you know, I have a rehearsal I have to go\u2019. And he said, \u2018forget that rehearsal\u2019. But he engaged me in more conversation, and finally talked me into getting into the car,\u201d recalls Scarlet, noting that the depth of the conversation made her realise the man in the car wasn\u2019t a Bob Dylan lookalike. \u201cThis was the real thing,\u201d she laughs. Then, in that apartment full of musical instruments, Dylan used the piano and guitar to play for her \u201cobscure songs\u201d and asked her to play along. No chart, no key, nothing. And Scarlet played along, realising only much later that it was a \u201csink or swim situation\u201d. He was kind of deadpan, playing song after song as she wielded her bow. Then, suddenly, he asked her if she would accompany him to a Muddy Waters show about to happen in the neighbourhood. Oh, to be in New York City. Scarlet tagged along. No brainer. Dylan sat her down on a bar stool with a drink and went off, only to appear on stage alongside Muddy. \u201cThe place went absolutely bananas. Then he went to the microphone, and to the shock of my life, said, \u2018now I want my violinist to come up and play\u2019,\u201d she says with relish about the moment she realised for the first time that she was the chosen one. \u201cThen I got the chance to play with the Muddy Waters Band, and I got a solo from Muddy Waters\u2026 then the whole band stared at me, and little by little, each one smiled. I got a thumbs up from Bob Dylan and Muddy Waters on the same day.\u201d Then about a week later, Scarlet got a call from Dylan, asking her to show up at CBS studios, where upon arrival she saw a host of musicians, but didn\u2019t really get to interact with them as she had to play from an isolation booth to prevent sound leakage. Days later she realised that most of the band members were gone, leaving her and a trio of musicians including bassist Rob Stoner and drummer Howard Wyeth. She was then completely oblivious of the fact that they would, in fact, be re-recording/overdubbing what was to be released a year later in 1976 as the album Desire even though some of it had already been recorded by Dylan using top sessions musicians of New York and Eric Clapton and his band. \u201cThe reality of it didn\u2019t sink in actually for years. It happened really quickly. But it was a very long day. When the red light wasn\u2019t on and we weren\u2019t recording but rehearsing the next song with everybody, I got to see  Clapton in the room and play at the same time. Then, I get a little bit of feedback from Bob. At one point I was playing his song, and he started to play harmonica, and I stopped playing. He stopped the song and said, \u2018I actually want you to play over my harmonica and see what happens\u2019.\u201d They all went home at dawn after a tiring day of recording. But when Scarlet returned to the studio, she saw that Clapton and his band had gone. All the sessions players were gone. \u201cIt was like the \u2018Showdown at the OK Corral\u2019. I was the one that was left standing in the room,\u201d she says. We hear Scarlet in full flow in the album of course, but more so in the concerts played during Dylan\u2019s Rolling Thunder tour, footage of which has been patched together delightfully _ annoyingly, some might add _ by Martin Scorsese as a montage of fictional interludes to the carnivalesque excesses of the performances in the Netflix rockumentary, Rolling Thunder Revue. Her face adorned with line drawings, she stands tall to the right of Dylan, playing alongside and over his incessant vocals, frenetic guitar and incisive harmonica. Quite an accomplishment, a marquee moment no doubt within the evolving aesthetics of rock music of the mid-70s. \u201cI also found out later that many people have tried to play over his harmonica but that didn\u2019t work. I guess, I am one of the few people that has successfully played while he\u2019s playing at the same time,\u201d she concurs. The Rolling Thunder tour had an eclectic star cast of musicians, poets, and playwrights. From Roger McGuinn, Joan Baez and Joni Mitchell to poet Allen Ginsberg and Sam Shepard, in addition to Dylan\u2019s band that included T Bone Burnett. It was fun, but a musical highpoint of monumental proportions. \u201cWhen somebody\u2019s wearing a mask, he\u2019s going to tell the truth. When he\u2019s not wearing a mask, it\u2019s highly unlikely,\u201d Dylan says in the film when he\u2019s not wearing one. The songs they played during the tour were rehearsed, as Scarlet recalls, while commenting on a picture of Dylan and her sitting together like \u201cBonny and Clyde\u201d. But the performances were wrapped in the brilliance of spontaneity. The versions varied, changing tempo and mood from energetic to contemplative night after night. Compare   of Desire to the live version and the magic is evident. \u201cI was on stage with Roger McGuinn and Joni Mitchell. The level of musicianship around me was mind blowing,\u201d is how Scarlet describes the tour of 31 concerts spanning 40 days across 23 cities. \u201cIt was a magical experience on stage and off. And Bob\u2019s level of performance and singing at that period was just on fire.\u201d The atmosphere was nothing like Scarlet had ever experienced. Dylan, she explains, wanted to do this for the sake of music and for the spirit of camaraderie it generates when like-minded artistes play together. \u201cI feel that Bob Dylan could have easily been playing at larger venues of, say, 10,000-seat capacity. He could have done this to make money. But he really wanted to do this for the audience. He chose smaller places. The business guys were tearing out their hair\u2026 He brought many more people on. And on days off he would create opportunities for us to do unusual things together sometimes.\u201d  In the Scorsese film, Scarlet explains the atmosphere of the tour as the \u201cTambourine Man\u201d allowing them the \u201cfreedom to be who we want to be.\u201d No wonder she felt compelled to give flight to her inner voice at the time. \u201cI was guided by, I believe, a muse. I was the first person on Day One to do face paint,\u201d she says. \u201cI had, I think, a diamond with a little sword and a little snake, and something on my chest as well. But it wasn\u2019t about me trying to come up with a gimmick. Nor did I do it every day. It was just when I felt called to do it. But any band member that did it (and many of them did) subsequent to him doing the white face was just copycatting.\u201d Scarlet remembers a band meeting at the end of the tour with Dylan asking each one of them about their future plans. \u201cI think nobody really wanted it to end. And this was such a unique combination of people at that time. It was sad, a kind of depressing period,\u201d she says, calling it her Cinderella moment of having to move back home. \u201cI went back to New York City and then people started calling me for recording sessions. One of the first ones that came was from the leader of the New York Dolls, David Johansson. Then all kinds of recording sessions came in and I got back to violin lessons.\u201d Decades later, it is clear to her how because of that miraculous meeting with Dylan, and her subsequent playing with him, she has been able to do with the violin what she had always hoped to. Classically trained via private lessons from the time she was six or seven, Scarlet spent a year in orchestra and then moved to Mannes conservatory (The New School Mannes) in New York. But as a teenager, she had displayed a rebellious streak and got expelled from an orchestra for purposely spreading confusion about a piece they were to perform. \u201cWhen the conductor was out of the room, I told everybody to ask for the Beethoven (piece) when we were going to play the Mozart. And he was so mad that he broke his baton over my stand and told me to get out. From that point on, I was determined to integrate the violin into contemporary music and not just the music of hundreds of years ago,\u201d she says. Scarlet wanted to find a living voice for the violin, and not just as a \u201csweetener\u201d, the way Sinatra or Roy Orbison and Johnny Mathis used it. There was no such thing as a rock violin soloist. But after Rolling Thunder, she had established herself as one. If the improvisation of the kind she did with Dylan seems natural, it\u2019s because of her varied taste in music. \u201cSince high school and college, I was listening a lot even though I was in an orchestra and reading music and taking lessons. On the side, I was listening deeply to the Doors, John Mayall and the Blues Breakers, John Lee Hooker, Janis Joplin, Tangerine Dreams, King Crimson\u2026 They were just exciting to me.\u201d That seems to have worked. Her collaborations with the likes of Mercer Ellington (the Duke\u2019s son), Eric Anderson and Tracy Chapman speak for themselves. Last April, she launched an album, her 12th. All of Me is an EP of six songs in which she is singing, for the first time, about democracy, bad money and the agonising lack of common sense.   best exemplifies her \u201cdeep-seeded smouldering vocals\u201d notes American Highways, an independent web magazine of American music.  is a tribute to her friend Joni Mitchell. Today, says Scarlet, it\u2019s not just the violin that has gone mainstream. \u201cIt\u2019s spread to all the strings like, say, cello. Also, synth strings have replaced violin a lot in other things as well _ of course you can\u2019t really replace the real sound though you can imitate it. But I believe I opened the door for many other violin/string players who hear and do things differently,\u201d she says, adding how a critic spoke of her playing as the \u201cemotional counterpoint to Jean Luc Ponty\u201d when I bring up the French violinist\u2019s pioneering endeavours in jazz rock.   Yet, Scarlet has never allowed herself to move away from the core. \u201cI stayed with classical music too,\u201d she notes, going on to talk about future projects that include an album of her Celtic compositions and another compilation of her jazz-rock pieces. Additionally, she is part of an ambitious world music project that is intended, as audio and video, to highlight scientific statistics on the perils of climate change and biodiversity. \u201cThe music will live on,\u201d she says, her beloved muse continuing to guide her the way it did decades ago when she was crossing that road in the East Village of NYC. A moment earlier, or later, who knows? Bob Dylan\u2019s car would have missed her, never to find her again. Scarlet listens to Desire often. \u201cI still really like listening to   and  . I wish  was included in place of  . And I still listen to some live tracks as well, you know, from our live shows,\u201d she says affectionately. The memories are treasured; most of all about how protective Dylan was of her during the tour. \u201cHe knew that I was just as green as an apple. I\u2019d never been on a stage before that day, and I had never been around so many people. I was extremely shy. There were a lot of people around us with the band guys doing drugs and what not. You know, people can be mean, and there were jealous women around\u2026 he just knew that I was going to be the target of a lot of things that I was innocent about. And so, he just kept an eye out,\u201d she says, convinced that her very nature of being \u201can anti-social activist and intense musician\u201d was the precursor of why she and him would have been a good fit. She hasn\u2019t met Dylan in the last few years but has seen him often on and off stage in New York and Minneapolis, his hometown. Just after Rolling Thunder she went to a concert of his sometime in the \u201980s with a common friend from Minneapolis who was visiting. It was a very small place and it was sold out. They were called in and invited to the dressing room. And just before the band was going on stage, and before Scarlet and the friend could walk out to their seats, she heard Dylan telling his musical director, \u2018please add   to the set\u2019. ",

        "Article Content": "It was July 25, 1965. Bob Dylan took the stage at the Newport Folk Festival sporting black jeans, black boots, a black leather jacket and, very importantly, carrying a Fender Stratocaster instead of an acoustic guitar. He plugged in his guitar and the crowd pulverised him for going electric. It\u2019s said that Pete Seeger went to the extent of trying to cut the sound cables with an axe. Maybe the last bit involves adding some colour to the black-and-white wardrobe of Dylan. Nonetheless, he did go electric and his music changed. Beyond that, the bard of our times, who turned 80 on Monday, shares an indifferent-dislike-hate relationship with technology. The person who almost won Dylan over was the late Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. Jobs had immense respect for Dylan\u2019s music to which he was introduced at the age of 13 or 14 by his friend Steve Wozniak. \u201cHe was a very clear thinker, and he was a poet. I think he wrote about what he saw and thought. The early stuff is very precise. But, as he matured, you know, you had to unravel it a little bit. But once you did, it was just as clear as a bell,\u201d Jobs said in a 2003 interview with  . Jobs managed to meet his childhood hero when the singer was playing near Palo Alto in October 2004. \u201cWe sat on the patio outside his room and talked for two hours. I was really nervous, because he was one of my heroes. And I was also afraid that he wouldn\u2019t be really smart anymore, that he\u2019d be a caricature of himself, like happens to a lot of people. But I was delighted. He was as sharp as a tack. He was everything I\u2019d hoped,\u201d the tech guru is quoted in Walter Isaacson\u2019s biography of Steve Jobs. Dylan ended up in an iPod advertisement, strumming Someday Baby, while a silhouetted dancer, sporting her iPod, danced across the screen. Unlike previous iPod ads, this one had shades of black and white. And he has even come close to considering writing a song \u201cwith\u201d a computer. In 2015, he featured in an IBM commercial for the company\u2019s artificial intelligence software, Watson. \u201cI can read 800 million pages per second. My analysis shows your major themes are time passes and love fades,\u201d Watson tells Dylan. Overall, the singer doesn\u2019t have any love for phones. His aversion for it is well-known and at a show in Vienna in 2019, he stopped playing after he noticed a fan taking pictures. It\u2019s a no-photos policy at his gig. Only a verse into Blowin\u2019 in the Wind, he had paused to say: \u201cTake pictures or don\u2019t take pictures. We can either play or we can pose. Okay?\u201d Yet, he knows that not everyone hates smartphones. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lot more anxiety and nervousness around now than there used to be\u2026. We have a tendency to live in the past, but that\u2019s only us. Youngsters don\u2019t have that tendency. They have no past, so all they know is what they see and hear, and they\u2019ll believe anything. In 20 or 30 years from now, they\u2019ll be at the forefront. When you see somebody that is 10 years old, he\u2019s going to be in control in 20 or 30 years, and he won\u2019t have a clue about the world we knew... Telecommunications and advanced technology is the world they were born into. Our world is already obsolete,\u201d he told   in a rare interview in 2019. By the way, he also hates CDs. \u201cEven these songs probably sounded 10 times better in the studio when we recorded \u2019em. CDs are small. There\u2019s no stature to it,\u201d he had told   in 2006. Going by his train of thoughts, he doesn\u2019t use a smartphone. You can well imagine the man speaking into a rotary-dial telephone while having a glass of whisky.",

        "Article Content": "Let me preface my interpretation of this classic song by saying exactly what it is - my interpretation! This is a vivid masterpiece of innuendo and insinuation of a man struggling to come to terms with his obvious feelings for a \u201cworking\u201d woman, feelings that are perhaps not reciprocated. The lyrics paint a powerful mystique of a woman, who the singer obviously desires but struggles with his emotions knowing that his outreach is in vain. The object of his desires toys with him, whilst continuing with her \u201cwork\u201d ( The singer is torn between the seemingly correct choice of letting her go and at the same time being unable to deal with her rejection (H . He secretly hopes she might return ( The chord progression is so apt in its simple descending bass line with the major to minor transition being particularly poignant in depicting the heart-numbing loneliness felt by the singer (\u2019 \u2019). The last verse sums it up beautifully in the realization that fate has indeed dealt him a cruel hand\u2026Their worlds can never meet...( ).  I hope you enjoy my rendition in simple tribute to the Man on his 80th. ( Dylan's songs, to me, are like jazz standards with words. They are tailor made for improvisation and yet each song retains its flavour no matter what ingredients you add to it. The late great Monojt Datta \u2014 Kochu da to all us music lovers of Calcutta, whom I had the privilege of knowing closely and playing with in his band Orient Express when it was a Latin-jazz outfit \u2014 used to say that a composition, to be a composition, must have a stout trunk; the leaves and branches add to its beauty but the trunk determines how tall or how big a tree is. Dylan's songs' trunks are so stout that they withstand all assaults of time and space. I found myself singing and recording   last year after losing my father and my job in quick succession. The song has been interpreted by many, many musicians and many, many great guitar players including Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, John Mayer. But it never loses its uniqueness no matter who is playing it.   Funnily enough, the first time I heard this song was when Guns \u2018n Roses did that explosive cover. And for quite some time, I didn\u2019t even know it was a Bob Dylan song; just like, say, Cocaine, which I only got to learn later was a JJ Cale song. So, here\u2019s my version of what is yet another timeless song by Bob Dylan. I hope you like it. ( Among the many phases of Dylan\u2019s legendary career, I especially love the folk period of the mid-60s.   is a signpost song from that period. Performed by Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival in 1964, it was released as a single the following year. Few songs have had such a powerful combination of melodic and lyrical beauty. The song is like an artist\u2019s canvas interspersed by his many colours. The surreal imagery used is haunting. The song is a testament to the brilliant poet Dylan is. The use of words and phrases in the song creates a beautiful chime in the ear. As a musician, I have always loved performing it. The melodic richness can make it sound beautiful when played acoustic as well as with a heavy sounding folk-rock arrangement. A timeless classic.  ( ) I chose this song because it's one of the greatest songs ever written. It's bitterly hopeful, just like the man. His lyrical imagery is unparalleled, snide overtones, backhanded compliments, et al. It's all very fragile if you can see it. A lot of people think he is not a great singer. I beg to differ. He is what every singer would like to be, instantly recognizable, permanently memorable and according to me, highly likeable too. Even his rhythm playing is off the charts. It is complex and detailed contrary to what the simpleton jingle-jangle brigade think it is. I chose this one because it began my Dylan journey, maybe 27-28 years ago when I was very young. Of course, being in Jadavpur University later on in life made it easy to be around his music. Someone or the other was always playing it on a guitar. His influence on me is profound. I do not know a world without his work. His humour has shaped mine. His observant nature has seeped into my psychology. It's impossible to not have that kind of presence felt on a daily basis. As a musician, it's also very difficult for me to carve a voice of my own that is not influenced by Dylan in some way or the other. But that's also the beauty of it! This iconic song was written by Bob Dylan in 1962 and is representative of his mystical approach to life, often asking questions which never had definite answers! For us in JelliBellies, this is a protest song that raises rhetorical questions about peace, war and freedom. Dylan says that the answer is blowing in the wind because nobody knows the answer. Everybody tries to get it, but it slips away from our hold. And that's life's eternal parody. The New World Singers were the first to record  Dylan\u2019s manager, Albert Grossman, gave a demo of the song to another act he managed, a trio named Peter, Paul & Mary. The song -- Dylan claimed he wrote it in 10 minutes -- is so relevant in these trying times, especially in the Indian context with our shaded political system accruing from the centre, where freedom is being questioned and the fundamentals of liberal existence are at stake.   ( ) Salute to the living legend as he embarks his 81st trip around the sun. Bob Dylan has been a huge inspiration as a singer, songwriter, music composer and poet. His music is magical and powerful. This song is very close to me. I think two lines of this song can sum up all the feelings of resentment felt by anyone and everyone who has had a hard time with relationships. It perfectly depicts how everyone goes through hardship but eventually emerges victorious. Life moves on and to sum it all up:  . This is also an online collaboration with a friend, Michelangelo Bologna, playing the harmonica all the way from Marksville, Louisiana.   We chose this song because we feel it has more depth than what is apparent at first hearing. When you get into the mind of the lyrical genius that is Bob Dylan, you see the song in a different light. A joker, who is vexed with society and its ways, wishes to find an escape hatch. It\u2019s in the first line of the song when he tells the thief  In ways can\u2019t we all relate to the joker\u2019s emotions in today\u2019s modern world? We find ways and means to get away, or as the joker tells the thief,   from this reality. But just as we get flustered when we feel the weight on our shoulders, the thief tells the joker there is  , in a way asking him to take a breath and gather his emotions just like any of our near and dear ones would. Pick us up when we\u2019re done and get us back on the horse to continue the rest of the ride.  Happy birthday, Bob Dylan. Thank you for the music. ",

        "Article Content": "Of the many gut-wrenching events of the pandemic, particularly poignant was a doctor\u2019s account of how Soham sang to his mother Sanghamitra over the phone upon knowing that she wouldn\u2019t make it. He broke down in the middle but was able to finish what he wanted to say:  . Dr Dipshikha Ghosh and her nursing compatriots stood by. A raging pandemic is no time for celebration. Hence, we will not. We will live through the time as only humans can. Try. Help each other. And if a song or poem helps us on the way. So be it. Not that you needed Bob Dylan to mark his 80th milestone to recall his songs, but it sure helps. Many of his songs seem written for now, and for the people we were, the people we have become. There is a song for everyone _ for all those who helped us try, those that stayed true to the Hippocratic Oath they signed up to, those that stayed true to the logic of science; for the gurdwara that set up an oxygen langar and the autorickshaw driver who fitted his three-wheeler with an oxygen cylinder; for that lone   seller at the crematorium who parched thirsty souls by offering free coconut water to the bereaved; for the elderly man who moved from town to town distributing \u201camity leaflets\u201d among bus and rail passengers, urging them to read the appeal he had penned about shunning hatred, divisiveness and bigotry; for all those who were left in the lurch, burnt the soles of their feet during a long, treacherous, lonesome walk back home; the delivery boys on two-wheelers that keep our home fires burning; for our children, those blessed with the luxury of online classes and those who are not; for all those who stood helpless as they watched their loved ones being taken away from them; for the powers that be who celebrated too early, prescribed dark chocolates and abdicated all responsibility, the decision-makers who did not decide, and their cheerleaders with blinkers in their eyes. There\u2019s one for us too, we who have failed our country by not learning from the past and by not choosing responsibly; we who have failed our children by not asking the right questions, and demanding answers. And now, the only thing we have bequeathed to them is a long and arduous battle that we should have fought. SHELTER FROM THE STORM has a deceptive foot-tapping feel-good touch to it with the bass playing a counter melody. Yet it is meant to be an ode to a love affair that has run its course. The song faithfully, and affectionately, recalls the good times, but never shies away from dwelling on the reasons behind the relationship falling apart. Evidently, Dylan loved the way it turned out. For it was one of the tracks from the New York recording sessions he retained in the final album and did not replace, like he had done with five other tracks, with re-recordings done with a local band in Minnesota while visiting his brother. The endearing tone about the song is the manner in which the protagonist takes responsibility for the good times and the bad, thereby acknowledging his own shortcomings that led to the collapse of ties. Discerning chroniclers of life say that is the first step towards any kind of resolution. FOREVER YOUNG is one of Dylan\u2019s most popular songs. It is a song he wrote for his children, and said he\u2019d never wanted it to be \u201csentimental\u201d. Yet, it may seem so although if you read between the lines it is more than a mere wish-list that everything turns out good for our children, a sentiment all parents readily embrace. The song is in the nature of a preparatory sermon. In simple words it holds aloft an ideal to pursue in a lifetime. The version I like best is the one with The Band of the 70s, it is not quite the rough-edged improvisational magic he and the boys created back in Woodstock in the late 60s. It\u2019s neater. The mandolin and accordion/organ embed in it the soul of truth, the need to first recognise it to be able to give it due respect; then standing up for it with nothing less than a joyous heart. RING THEM BELLS is regarded as the most profound of all songs in Dylan\u2019s album, Oh Mercy, cut in 1989 when he was going through a creativity crisis. It\u2019s a beautiful hymn, described varyingly as a \u201cpost-apocalyptic gospel prayer\u201d embedded with \u201cstately piano\u201d, Biblical richness and elegance\u201d. It seems to all come together in the last line when the poet talks of breaking down the distance between right and wrong. \u201cThere are good deeds and bad deeds. A good person can do a bad thing and a bad person can do a good thing,\u201d he writes in Chronicles while discussing the song and goes on to praise producer Daniel Lanois for putting the \u201cmagic into its heartbeat and pulse.\u201d THINGS HAVE CHANGED is a song that doesn\u2019t \u201cpussyfoot around nor turn a blind eye to human nature,\u201d said Dylan after it won an Oscar for Best Original Song for the film,  (Curtis Hanson). Recorded in 1999, it\u2019s a bluesy jaunt of a track that unspools the predicament of a man clearly out of sync with today\u2019s world. He\u2019s waiting for the last train, finds himself running after folks he doesn\u2019t care about, all the while watching time hurtling past as he travels 40 miles of bad road. Poignantly enamouring is the opening line about this \u201cworried man with a worried mind\u201d who is coming to this dreadful conclusion that indeed his time is up. Or is it? ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER has been performed by Dylan more than any other of his songs. And a lot many more musicians have played it _ thanks to the genius of one Jimi Hendrix, whose riveting guitar interpretation of the track stunned the world for its dexterous outpouring of emotions hidden between the lines, as if dragging us by our throats to feel the force of what is an ode to societal conflict. We are on edge, waiting for lift-off. But it never quite happens. There\u2019s an underlying tension throughout this conversation between a joker and a thief as images come floating by, of plowmen and businessmen, of princes watching out from distant towers. The wind is howling as the two riders hurtle towards each other. No one knows what is to come of it. IF NOT FOR YOU is a love song that celebrates the simple pleasures of domesticity, a yearning that at times seems utopian in the very nature of its appreciation. It is among the more familiar songs of its parent album (New Morning) probably because of George Harrison\u2019s meditative version in his seminal album, All Things Must Pass. Interestingly, the Beatle uses an array of guitars for low-key background embellishment, his own slide, a Dobro and some acoustic additives, courtesy Peter Frampton. There is also, somewhere in the music, according to George Harrison, The Apple Years 1968-75, a harmonium too. The two friends performed it together at the Concert for Bangladesh (1971), the full performance of which was only included much later in a DVD re-issue of the concert film.   is a timeless song of sincerity, of elegant verse and heartfelt gratitude. HARD RAIN IS GONNA FALL, says Dylan, is a \u201cdesperate kind of song.\u201d  Written when he was 22, at the time of the 1962 Cuba Missile crisis, there has been much speculation about where its real origins lay. But this song is a \u201csmall epic\u201d, too vast to be confined to specific timeframes of history. \u201cEvery line in it,\" says Dylan in the album\u2019s liner notes (The Freewheeling Bob Dylan, 1963), \"is actually the start of a whole song. But when I wrote it, I thought I wouldn't have enough time alive to write all those songs so I put all I could into this one.\" Every verse is an account of events and people observed keenly, and lessons learnt. From the astounding opening line, \u201cOh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son? And where have you been, my darling young one?\u201d to the last verse, Dylan lays it out as it is. His observations, in black and white, ring true even today. Dylan wrote I SHALL BE RELEASED during his time with The Band in 1967. His own version did not make it to the Basement Tapes album of 1975, but The Band put up theirs in the exceptional debut album Music From Big Pink. It\u2019s Richard Manuel all the way. He takes the song, a paean to the departed, to places in our hearts and minds we never knew existed. His unparalleled emotional investment captures the hymn-like qualities of this ultimate tribute to life. Many also like to hark back to the star-studded version of the song in The Last Waltz, The Band\u2019s farewell concert in 1976, for the manner in which the lyrics evoke both reverence and inspiration. In today\u2019s world, this is one song that can be played over and over again. MASTERS OF WAR, as Dylan has said, was never intended as an anti-war song. It was, instead, meant to go hammer and tongs against the industry of war, deride those who profit from war and, therefore, push national leaders towards the path of confrontation. The song\u2019s bluntness and stridency, betrays a purposeful abandonment of subtlety and nuance that is the hallmark of Dylan the songwriter. It opens with a line that attacks his target head-on. \u201cCome you masters of war,\u201d he says as the guitar strums emphatically. And from then on, he unleashes lyrics of unbridled power and rage. NOT DARK YET is an astonishing song about a man on his last legs. It is not so much about the physicality of death as it is about something worse. It is the squashing of the internal self, that innate sense of belief that leads to understanding, contentment and happiness. Things are so bad that death would be a saviour. Yet, that\u2019s not to be. Musically, the song is impactful in its slow, funereal pace; a stoic acceptance of a state of being that is a painful surrender. This is a sad song; a very sad song, whose import is startlingly real in the world we inhabit.",

        "Article Content": "Perhaps one of the boldest tribute albums of all times is the one curated by French producer Alain Weber in which he has musicians from across the globe sing their own versions of Bob Dylan songs. Released by Buda Musique sometime in early 2014, From Around the World has a few of our own. Purna Das Baul, who as we all know played with Dylan for the John Wesley Harding album of 1968 and is also featured on its cover, teams up with his son to take a shot at  , as does Gazi Khan Barna of Rajasthan who performs a version of  with Anwar Khan Manganiyar that, save the title, is all new! There is a reworking of   by Eliades Ochoa, the guitar wiz from Bueno Vista Social Club who makes a Cuban standard out of it, and many other musicians who innovate audaciously _ make a Romanian lament out of  , infuse Sufi lyrics to   and put out a wailing  The central idea of the project was that Dylan\u2019s work reached well beyond America, explains Weber. \u201cI wanted people who were like Dylan. People with the same spirit, poets in their own culture,\u201d he told American Songwriter. \u201cSome knew his music, others didn\u2019t. We translated lyrics. It was vital they could identify with the words, to feel the image and meanings.\u201d Filmmaker singer-songwriter Jaimin Rajani has his own story how he and friend cinematographer/editor Vineet Arora _ the duo behind \u201cIf Not For You\u201d, a documentary that celebrates Calcutta\u2019s emotional connect with Bob Dylan _ discovered the album accidentally and then reached out to Alain and Gazi Khan and made a short film in which the international star of the Rajasthani folk world narrates his experience of performing a Dylan song in his native tongue. \u201cThe artists have made these songs their own by reinventing them for their native style,\u201d says Jaimin in a conversation with  . Excerpts While listening to Purna Das Baul\u2019s   in Alain's Dylan tribute album soon after its release, I spotted Divana, credited against the song  . Divana sounded Indian but I had never heard of the name before. So out of curiosity, that's the next song I played and was amazed to hear a beautiful Rajasthani rendition of my favourite song from Infidels. Initially, I was under the impression that Divana was the stage name of one man. For a year I searched for Divana's real identity with no luck. Then in 2018, during a visit to Jaipur, I made acquaintance with volunteers of Rajasthan Studio and Jaipur Virasat Foundation, two initiatives that aim to promote Rajasthani folk music  Someone from the foundation was kind enough to put me in touch with Gazi Khan and that's when I learnt Divana was the name of his entourage. Khan then introduced me to Alain, who I bonded with over our mutual admiration for Dylan. Earlier this year, Gazi Khan happened to be in Calcutta for a concert and invited me over to the guest house he was putting up in. That's when I recorded him.   Yes, that was indeed the initial plan. However, that never worked out because we had very little time on our hands. While Vineet and I were working in Calcutta, Gazi Khan was touring with his group across Rajasthan, and our schedules didn't permit us to travel. While Calcutta's and Shillong's affinity for Dylan is widely known, the Rajasthan connection would have added a unique flavour to the documentary and perhaps been a revelation for many. That's what makes the album so interesting and creative. The artists have made these songs their own by reinventing them in their native style. They aren\u2019t mere covers. Each interpretation is unique and original. In fact, this is what even Dylan is doing with his own songs - changing their melodies and tempo in order to suit his present vocal texture and limitations, not making it sound anything like the studio versions we're familiar with. Yes, Anwar has an amazing voice, natural and limitless. In fact, I would like to share with you a performance of the song,   recorded by him and his troupe.",

        "Article Content": "Today, she plays some of the exact same notes she played 45 years ago while performing alongside Bob Dylan on  , the first song of his 1975 album Desire. Yet, Scarlet Rivera manages to somehow surpass the electrifying energy of the past while accompanying Los Angeles band Nine Mile Station for an igniting rerun of the track to commemorate 80 years of the singer-songwriter.  She calls it a \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201cstunning\u201d version, but the 2021 take of this song about racial injustice has turned out even better than that. \u201cI have performed  many times live but have never recorded it with anyone else since the Original with Bob Dylan, till now,\u201d she says in a Facebook post tagged to a preview of the track. The song as we all know is about Rubin \u201cHurricane\u201d Carter, a champion boxer in prison convicted of a 1966 triple murder in New Jersey. He proclaimed his innocence, but his subsequent conviction seemed to be racially motivated, based as it was on \u201cfalse evidence\u201d. But Rubin\u2019s conviction was finally overturned in 1998 after he had been found guilty once again in a second trial in 1976. This new version, with Scarlet and her violin collaborating with Will Hawkins and Fernando Perdomo of Nine Mile Station, is at once reverential to the original yet unbounded in its musical prowess and outreach. As if surmounting the insurmountable, the band flies above clouds that are too high in the sky for us to even see. \u201cThis electric intensity she summons with an acoustic violin merges ancient strains of klezmer and gypsy street music, forever wedding darkness and light, the deep sorrow of the ages against the new promise of joy in every sunrise and birdsong,\u201d writes Paul Zollo in American Songwriter. Couldn\u2019t agree more. The evidence of that rare magic is in the playing and singing; the tantalisingly brief guitar-violin interplay towards the end _ brilliant _ and the manner in which Hawkins\u2019s ragged but free-flowing vocals add emphatic texture to the lyrics ensures that every word pierces the heart and mind. All over again. I am reminded of what Scarlet told me months ago on her recording experience with Dylan, particularly about playing alongside, and over, his harmonica. \u201cAt one point I was playing his song, and he started to play harmonica, and I stopped playing. And he stopped the song and said, \u2018I actually want you to play over my harmonica and see what happens\u2019. I also found out later that many people have tried to play over his harmonica but that didn\u2019t work. I guess, I am one of the few people that has successfully played while he\u2019s playing at the same time,\u201d she said. This year is the first time ever Scarlet has recorded the song since the original with Dylan. \u201cThe story of   and its message of racial injustice and police corruption sadly continues to be as relevant today as it was in 1975. As always, art conveys truth and opens minds and hearts,\u201d she notes. Yet another song of our times. Sing it. Sing it out loud.",

        "Article Content": "All the world\u2019s a stage. Indeed. Days from now, life\u2019s many prosceniums will morph into one. And Bob Dylan will be on it, in our living rooms. July 18 (July 19 for India) promises to be an exciting moment for music fans no doubt, but this first ever broadcast show from the Tambourine Man after his 1995 MTV Unplugged is dizzyingly delightful for Dylan fans across the world, especially for those living outside the privileged circle of venues his Never Ending Tour of live gigs has pit-stopped so far. Or maybe not. With Dylan you never really know. Will it be a live stream or pre-recorded? What songs will he sing? Will he talk in-between, acknowledge the disembodied presence of millions of those eagerly waiting, logged in with their smart gadgets in the hope of seeing heaven\u2019s doors open. Never mind. Let\u2019s stay fixated on what we know. The past year has been the longest hiatus Dylan has ever taken from live performances since the beginning of his Never Ending Tour in 1998. He did not appear for a single show last year. The internet broadcast, therefore, is a fresh start. A reboot, accessible to all across the pandemic-hit world for the princely sum of $25 a ticket. Hence, that lonesome Bengali boy who was taught to sing Blowing in the Wind in Class III just has the very real possibility of attending a Zimmerman concert. Aside from all the myriad meanings this performance, enigmatically titled Shadow Kingdom, holds for all of us struggling to emerge from this time of multiple insecurities, the fact that the most iconic singer-songwriter of the time has chosen to embrace the virtual to bring home to us the very real experience of a live concert is staggering in import. The octogenarian rockstar_ his last birthday was two months ago _ who never stops reinventing himself has now opted for the most preferred mode of reaching out, his endorsement of a streaming service a much-needed encouragement for grounded performers the world over. The times they are a-changin\u2019, he said. And he\u2019s been there all through the way. A 30-second trailer gives us a peep into what we might expect from Shadow Kingdom. Shared across his social media handles, the black and white video shows him performing his 1971 bluesy foot-tapper,  , at an undisclosed venue with a band, all of them wearing mandatory masks, and a scattered bunch of people as audience. \u201cEarly songs of Bob Dylan\u201d is captioned early on in the trailer. Is it that he\u2019s going to do those and not selections from his most recent 2020 album, Rough and Rowdy Ways, which he hasn\u2019t played in a live setting? \u201cAll I know about it is what everyone else knows: that he's putting together a show,\u201d says Joel Madden, the 42-year-old co-founder of livestreaming platform Veeps that is hosting the show but clarifies there\u2019ll be renditions of songs from 2020\u2019s Rough and Rowdy Ways too. That settles it. A Dylan song, no matter when you hear it, speaks to us in the moment. Leon Russel, bless his soul, was on piano in the original. It was only in the late seventies that  started to feature intermittently in his live shows. It reappeared again about a decade later while he was playing with the Grateful Dead. The last time he\u2019s performed it live, notes Rolling Stone magazine, was on July 15, 2014 in Gothenburg, Sweden. \u201cThe song is like a painting, you can\u2019t see it all at once if you\u2019re standing too close,\u201d he told New York Times last year which is perhaps just the thing to do while approaching the tunes in Rough And Rowdy Ways. A no-holds-barred paean to life, RARW is a sweeping panorama of history and culture, philosophy and its many contradictions, love and hate, an assortment of body parts thrown in for good measure. It is Dylan\u2019s Ulysses on Instagram in slow motion. You see pictures and paintings in your mind\u2019s eye, you hear ruminations of death amid the slow burn of slide guitars and muted drums. Yet, just as Jacques circumnavigates the seven stages of life in his monologue on \u201cThe Stage\u201d and we feel he has made sense of it all, Dylan confesses:  . There was a time when it was  , even when the depths of despair seemed like an infinite abyss. Now, it is about devotion to ideas and ideals; to truth distilled of all lies and falsehoods; to love amid the looming shadow of death. To each his own, though. As You Like It. I presume these thoughts, all woven to tunes sung/spoken in the backdrop of tempered piano tones (Fiona Apple, among others), exquisite guitar triads (Charlie Sexton) and accordion flourishes bound by some low-end percussive understatements, will be articulated in a manner quite different from the parent album. Dylan is known to harbour multiple versions of his songs _ he contains multitudes, remember?  Think of the many ways he has celebrated \u201cthem charcoal gypsy maidens\u201d known to \u201cstrut their feathers well\u201d. Or the slow train that suddenly takes on a laid-back sense of urgency when Jerry Garcia and Co. were backing him up. And that \u201ccup of coffee\u201d that never seems to turn cold in the many ways he chooses to brew its ingredients? Art is the only way to run away without leaving home. Dancer choreographer Twyla Thorpe\u2019s timeless observation acquires multitudinous dimensions in the present-day context. The coming Dylan concert cements that thought, more so with his own admission. I sing songs of experience, he says, borrowing from William Blake. And experience is all we have with death as culmination. Having watched the river flow for so long, Dylan hints he\u2019s arrived at a conclusion, some sort of a closure may be. Our hearts are like a river, he says, sometimes it takes a while to realise things. But we keep trying. All the world\u2019s a stage. Indeed. And Bob Dylan is on it.",

They are huddled together at the rear, forming a protective arc around the man. Bob Dylan is singing. He is sounding good. Very good. He\u2019s at a smoky caf\u00e9 with men and women; it\u2019s all black and white, but not quite. Light and shade. Grey, steel grey, a burst of a blinding spotlight. It\u2019s gone!

The seductive staccato charm of the original was reworked _very low-key with subdued harmonica, a haunting refrain of the guitar adding to its mystic charm. Its many posers summed up the mood. None of us was sure what Shadow Kingdom was all about. We thought about it, harboured expectations, all along not quite sure of anything. All we knew was that the man would be there and would sing for us. He did. So, \u201cwhat was it you wanted\u201d, he asked, fists held tight, bringing his arms down gently but definitively to the beat of the music.   its sprightly and avant-garde intonations intact, was another highlight, the guitar\u2019s mischievous twang leading the way and coming back to tease.  His new band was pitch-perfect, always careful not to over-play and stay true to the Rough and Rowdy Ways template wherein all the songs are sung like story poems in the backdrop of brooding instrumentation. Shadow Kingdom was as intimate as it gets with Dylan and the band captured in tight frames by an unobtrusive camera that seemed to be quite in awe of the music and musicians, at times even hesitating to get too close. Shadows play their part, naturally, as the audience does its bit drinking and smoking with gay abandon. Someone walks across, just as you would in a crowded bar, blocking the stars momentarily; at times, the lead guitarist is upfront in our face and doing his thing, as though a crooner serenading a beautiful woman at the table. The sound was excellent; crisp, sans frills. If streaming is this good, it\u2019s bound to have a future. Shadow Kingdom did not rock. It took us places gently, from the comfort of our homes.

        "Article Content": "If there was a list of famously unknown stars in the galaxy of rock music, he would surely be on it, shining bright. You can hear him singing harmony in  , play bass in the Bob Dylan exotica album Desire and see him sing alongside Dylan in the Rolling Thunder Revue, a Martin Scorsese film that is a mischievous pastiche of archival footage and wild fiction capturing the spirit of 1975 America with electrifying performances by Mr Zimmerman and such eminences as Joan Baez, Joni Mitchel and Allan Ginsberg along with a flurry of troubadours that were part of the travelling variety show. Rob (Rothstein) Stoner is a natural. A brilliant musician whom Dylan, known for his uncanny ability to zero in on real talent, chose as his band leader/musical director for the tour right after he had recorded Desire with a spartan collective of musicians that also included Scarlet Rivera on violin and Howie Wyeth on drums. \u201cIt was an amazing accomplishment and we did it with just a few days of rehearsals,\u201d Stoner tells me over Zoom from New York in an extensive conversation spanning his \u2026decade-long career as a top-draw, but low-key session musician. He has played for and with them all, from Don McLean and Joni Mitchel to Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr a host of folk singers of the 60s and 70s like Phil Oaks, Joan Baez and Pete Seeger.  \u201cI was well-known in those circles,\u201d he says in a matter of fact tone. \u201cI was in New York backing up singer-songwriters. I had already played and sang on the record, American Pie. I was the bass player and harmony singer on that record. And so, everybody knew me from that because that was a very successful record.\u201d No wonder then Bob Dylan picked him up. \u201cI met Bob Dylan several years before I started working with him. We got along well, and we agreed that we would do something in the future,\u201d he reminisces but reveals, with tongue firmly in cheek, that he didn\u2019t think much of that promise at the time _ \u201cSure, I'll believe that when I see it\u201d. Yet, it happened and Bob Dylan did call Stoner. The Desire album was his first project with him in the summer of 1975. Dylan was looking for a new group and as it so happened, he had summoned a whole bunch of musicians including the likes of Eric Clapton to work with him, but he wasn\u2019t getting anywhere with the recording even though he had worked out all the songs. Ultimately, it fell on Stoner, who had been called in as an independent observer, to do the straight talking.  \u201cWell, I could see right away when I showed up at the recording studio that everything was disorganized. And Bob Dylan was so focused on his music, he didn't see all the confusion around him. I, however, saw this as an objective observer and asked Bob to send all these people home. \u2018You're wasting your time. You're never gonna get results\u2019, I told him.\u201d Finally, at Stoner\u2019s suggestion, Dylan agreed to a simple line-up of guitar, bass, violin and drums, a combination he was so intrigued by he agreed instantly _ \u2018Oh, what the hell? I\u2019ll try it\u2019. Stoner knew that Dylan liked spontaneity. He was not for doing take after take. He\u2019d rather do a run through of the song once or twice and if it\u2019s good enough, stick with it. \u201cSo sort of on a dare, he took up my offer. But I could hear the sound we wanted for the album in my mind before the band ever assembled. I knew how my drummer (Howard \u2018\u2019Howie\u2019 Wyeth) worked. I knew Scarlet Rivera (violin) sounded good. She has sort of a raw quality which complements Bob's raw quality. And that I could just fit in between all these cracks and make the thing sound good. I was the glue that held it all together.\u201d The net result was Desire, one of Dylan\u2019s most distinctive albums about outlaws, a heavyweight champion wrongly accused of murder and tomes on marriage and failing relationships, a tribute to his soon to be ex-wife Sara. It also had Emmylou Harris and Ronee Blakley on additional vocals. \u201cWe instantly started getting results. We did about 10 songs. The first night we did the entire album plus some outtakes that they used later such as  \u201d Stoner recalls and describes the omission of   from the album as a \u201csin\u201d _ \u201cIt was so silly because Joey is like a long, boring song about an outlaw.\u201d He is also miffed, although he is old enough (75) now to be able to laugh about it, that the album credits did not mention him as a harmony singer. In fact, when they recorded  , Emmylou Harris had gone and it was Stoner who had to do backing vocal duty too. His natural prowess as a singer, lead as well as backing, has been documented by no less than the late American author, actor, playwright Sam Shepard, who while reviewing a Rolling Thunder performance wrote, \u201cRob Stoner grafted harmonies onto Dylan like a Siamese twin.\u201d Pleased as he is about that, Stoner, however, bemoans that harmony is a \u201clost art now\u201d and goes on to narrate a lovely story that reinforces his musical abilities. Not many know that the Everly Brothers did a version of Abandoned Love, and they fashioned it on the original. \u201cWe were trying to be like the Everly Brothers and when they recorded the song and used the exact harmonies that Bob and I had sung, I was happy about it.\u201d So how does he do it? Does it help that Stoner also plays the bass? \u201cIt's all about listening to the lead singer at all times and watching his face. You watch when the mouth starts to change shape to make the next syllable so you can anticipate what's coming. It's really about being alert and sensitive,\u201d he says and goes on to stress that just because someone is a good singer, it doesn\u2019t mean he/she will also be able to sing harmonies. \u201cI am lucky I can sing both. In the movie, you can see me on the same mic singing with Bob sometimes.\u201d Many would agree that singing while playing the bass is difficult, but is made to look easy by the pros. Consider Paul McCartney, Jack Bruce to name a few. Now, add Rob Stoner to that little list. His felicity with the instrument is nothing short of phenomenal. Listen to One More Cup of Coffee, the live version, to get the drift, and be amazed. \u201cIt just comes naturally to me. I can play the bass in my sleep. It\u2019s so easy to me,\u201d he says, not boasting, but telling it like it is. \u201cI\u2019m also a piano player and a guitar player. (But) the bass to me is like a toy. I just do it autonomously, and that gives me the freedom to think about the singing.\u201d       The Rolling Thunder shows were musical milestones, the array of guest stars (Roger McGuinn, Ronnie Hawkins, Ringo Starr and many more) adding zing to the stellar performances. And Stoner reveals how meticulously these were mapped, courtesy Jacques Levy, Dylan\u2019s co-writer on the Desire album songs, and an accomplished Broadway producer. \u201cWe did it with just a few days of rehearsal. It's because Jacques Levy was so smart about theatre. He and I would stay up all night, thinking about how to plan this, like, this guy is got to be off the stage, and this guy is gonna come on. We had planned out every song. Like a stage play. This was like 30 rock concerts in a two or three-hour period.\u201d  The shows were a sonic and visual treat, what with Dylan\u2019s face-painting which the others quickly picked up on. Stoner remembers it all, at times right down to the songs. His narration is dramatic and detailed, mirroring the energy of the shows. \u201cBefore Bob came on stage, there were already five acts. To open, all the members of the band did our own songs. I did one, Mick Ronson did a song, T Bone Burnett did a song, Receiving Souls. Then we had Ronnie Blakely, who was very well known because of her part in the movie Nashville, come out and do a song. Then Jack Elliott, who was a big influence on Bob Dylan and Woody Guthrie, came out. Then Roger McGuinn would come out and do all his great hits from the Byrds and we\u2019d back him up. And then Joan Baez would come out and she'd do some songs. We\u2019d leave Joan alone without the band. And she would introduce Bob. Bob would come out and they would do a couple of duets. After they finished their duet section, Joan would leave. And this left Bob alone on stage, and he would do something by himself. Then, we'd bring the musicians back and do like a half-hour of electric music with Bob and that would really rock it\u2026 and in the middle of the electric music, most of the musicians would leave the stage and it would just be the Desire band, which is Scarlett, me and the drummer. And we had a percussionist too. Then we'd do a big, loud finale when we do Isis. (You can see) Bob and I are on the same mic screaming away... So, now there's an intermission for a half-hour, and we come back and we do basically the same thing except with different personnel.\u201d Yes, 30 rock concerts in three hours. To Stoner, Dylan counts most for his poetry, for which, he believes, he plays music, using it as a frame to help people listen to this statements. \u201cI mean, he's a good singer. He knows enough on his guitar and piano to just play his songs. The guy's not a virtuoso player. That's not his thing. His thing is the words and the statements, and so everything else he does is just to serve those particular ideas of what he has to say.\u201d But unlike Dylan, whose voice is now \u201cso tiny compared to how it used to be\u201d, Stoner\u2019s managed to keep his singing voice going, a nice \u2018n easy mix of Elvis and Jim Morrison, an assessment he seems to approve of. \u201cI always thought Jim Morrison took a lot from Elvis. I thought he sounded like a kind of a lounge singer Elvis Presley. And so, thanks man.\u201d Aside of Dylan, of all the musicians he\u2019s worked with, and among the few we are able to discuss, Stoner is perhaps most affectionately respectful about Joni Mitchell with Levon Helm and Richard Manuel of The Band coming in very close. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody remotely like Joni Mitchell, just like there's nobody like Bob,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are certain people whose art has lasted for decades and decades. These people are different. And when you talk to them, you get a sense that these people are endowed with such superior intelligence\u2026 In fact, most superstars I've met are like that.\u201d Levon of course was a close friend, the two hung out in the studio he and Robbie Robertson had set up in Santa Monica, called Shangri La. \u201cOur wives were also good friends. Levon would come to my shows and sit in and play drums. And his singing was amazing too,\u201d as was Manuel\u2019s. \u201cYeah, such a tragic life. The guy was such a sad guy. But he had an amazing gift.  And you know what's amazing to me is that in The Last Waltz _ everybody talks about what a great movie it is _ how come you can never see Richard Manuel,\u201d he jabs in, airing what rock aficionados have always maintained was an unforgivable lapse on the part of the great Scorsese to not devote enough footage to Manuel in the film that chronicles The Band\u2019s start-studded farewell concert on November 25, 1975, at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. In summation of Rob Stoner as a professional musician and singer it is his innate oneness with music that stands out more than anything else. Even more than his cavalier attitude towards fame. He knew as a child that when somebody sang a melody to him, he could go to the piano and play it right away. He was also smart enough to nurture that natural ability.  \u201c\u2026if you get formal training, then you can develop that ability to a higher art and be able to just mimic anything you hear, and maybe add your own little taste to it. So, that was the skill which I utilised,\u201d he concludes. So New Yorker Stoner could well be part of the Nashville, Tennessee, musical talent pool, the ones who studios use to conduct \u201chead sessions\u201d where the multi instrumentalists get to hear a new song _ in their head without a written score _ and figure out how to play it, hours before recording it with the star. As a session musician, Stoner is the guy they call up to play with no rehearsal. \u201cYou just show up. American Pie? I never heard the song in my life. I showed up. He (Don Mclean) played us the songs. We sat down and played it right away.\u201d Bob Dylan? The same. That\u2019s the reward, not that Stoner is seeking any. These days Stoner is doing music videos of his own, jazz, blues country, and posting them on YouTube _ his Facebook is full up and cannot accept any more friends. At other times, he\u2019s taking master classes on Zoom. \u201cIt\u2019s not inexpensive, which keeps the numbers down, but is a good way to have some money coming in.\u201d That\u2019s because he\u2019s still not comfortable going out and playing concerts. \u201cBecause I'm not a famous guy. I can't draw a lot of people. I can fill a small room of like, you know, 100 people or something. But that's kind of a small or medium-sized club. And those places are just unsafe, there's not enough ventilation, especially now in the winter,\u201d he adds with disarming candour and rationality. Ask him how it feels to be not famous and he calls it a strange combination. \u201cBut you know, there has to be somebody who does the hard work that makes the big guys famous. For every guy that's famous there's like 50 or 100 people behind them doing the day-to-day work. And they don't get the credit. We're the guys who really make the thing happen, the guys behind the scenes, the guys who write the arrangements, the guys who rehearse the band.\u201d That\u2019s Rob (Rothstein) Stoner, speaking out for generations of famous unknowns in the service of a timeless melody. Amen.",

        "Article Content": "Words, melody, blues, truth, philosophy. Bob Dylan is all these and a lot more. To commemorate his 81st birthday on Tuesday, a bunch of Calcutta musicians got together last Sunday night for a bare bones tribute concert at an old Calcutta hotel, whose earthly charms haven't faded with time.  Rather it has gotten cooler _ Broadway Hotel boasts air-conditioning now _ with a clientele that is young, different and in perfect sync with the present as it is with the past.  There were flourishes on the changing times, odes to cups of coffee and the Billy of yesterday, today and tomorrow. There was a celebration of women, especially those who break like little girls, and farewells to the many Angelinas who have touched our lives. The foreboding charms of the watchtower reflected tellingly in tombstones, all the while searching for questions, answers to which, we have been told, are blowing in the wind. In the end, as they knocked on heaven's door, the ale house roared in unison: I SHALL BE RELEASED. All the tables were taken, the draught beer was in full flow. Sandeep Seghal looked harried. But as proprietor, he was sure pleased as punch at the turnout.  The patrons were chatting away while the performers sang, screamed, wailed and hummed. The few who listened liked what they heard. The others loved it too. One even hollered a request: Jamaica Farewell!  I believe, if Bob was around, he would have embraced the idea. May have even sung it out loud with a twang.  At the near table was Nondon Bagchi, Calcutta's affable drummer boy and band leader who is also a foodie and maths teacher by day. He introduced Bob with characteristic professorial articulation. Short and sweet. Bob would have liked that. Once again, Calcutta showed its hand and how. Love and fun were in abundance. And occasionally a gentle doff to the prescience of the lyrics being brought to life. Yet a case could be made that next time round, which should happen around the same time as now in 2023, we get to savour some of Dylan's post-1976 ouvre. Singer-songwriter Jaimin Rajani, the earnest talent scout for Broadway, are you on? Act 1 showcased classic Dylan renditions by Arjun Kar and Someswar Bhattacharya. Bold and full-throated, all along embellished by neat guitar slides and fill-ins with a pitch-perfect harmonica. Act 2 was subdued but authoritative. Bibhubrata Acharjee chose to be seated as he strummed and sang. He also attempted a Bangla translation which everyone liked.  Act 3, a bonus, saw Nondon Bagchi belting out his staple.  . Vintage. Act 4 went electric with Rahul Guha Roy doing his thing, and getting the audience worked up. A nudge here, a jab of a note there, he had them eating out of his hand, the one he raised occasionally to make a point. A consummate performer always in control, Roy\u2019s the rockstar who doesn't have to try hard. Act 5 belonged to Durjoy Choudhury. He owned it with an inspired performance of Dylan classics with a voice that commands attention and a guitar that he slapped and cajoled at will. His harmonica was on song. Emphatic. ",

        "Article Content": "Bob Dylan has this penchant for changing his own songs. Performing live, he introduces generous variations in melody, altering lyrics and on several occasions rhythm of the songs in his setlist. Opinions vary on the end result. Some dislike them, dubbing his live shows as needless re-interpretations. But others, particularly musicians and serious listeners, welcome these versions. For them, his live performances reveal the myriad colours and shades they never imagined were embedded in his compositions, even in his most iconic studio recordings. Asked by The Huffington Post why he didn't perform his songs the same way twice, Dylan said he couldn't \"even if I tried\", adding (as Sam Kemp of UK's Far Out magazine reveals), by way of explanation: \"Daltrey, Townsend, McCartney, the Beach Boys, Elton, Billy Joel. They made perfect records, so they have to play them perfectly... exactly the way people remember them. My records were never perfect. So there's no point trying to duplicate them.\" On his 81st birthday, here's a selection of Dylan's live performances squared off with studio releases. Tell us what you think.",

        "Article Content": "For mere mortals like us, it was always great fun visiting a record store. Music under one roof. You could feel, if not hear, the emotions sheathed delicately within the artwork of each album cover. Love, devotion, surrender. Every visit is a new experience. Just like the change of seasons. Always a new surprise. But, how would it be, you might ask, for the star performers themselves? There's Elvis Presley staring at a rack of records. The black and white freeze-frame, upfront in Bob Dylan's new book, The Philosophy of Modern Song, has the King looking at a tempting display of records. He seems to have stopped in his tracks, his face at a gentle tilt. Follow his gaze and it's a howling Little Richard he's looking at. Or is he? Nearby are a couple of Harry Belafonte discs. Maybe, he got to humming Jamaica Farewell. Or maybe not. For, a row below, out of his line of vision, is an Elvis record, his own album of songs. He noticed, right? What was he thinking? We'll never know. It's what a song makes you feel about your own life that's important, writes Dylan early on in this effusive exposition of the Great American Songbook in the form of a 66-song diary that is at once affectionate, incisive and meticulous in the myriad ways he dives into the heart and soul of each number, most of them spanning the \u201950s and \u201960s. In the process, he is revealing a bit of himself too. Among the artistes and music groups whose songs make the Dylan cut, some lovingly hallowed by their own myths, are Little Richard, Elvis Costello, Perry Como, Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Pete Townsend (WHO), Jackson Browne, Bing Cosby, The Temptations, Ray Charles, Carl Perkins, Jimmy Reed, Nina Simone, The Allman Brothers, The Eagles, Johnny Cash, Judy Garland, Nina Simone, the Grateful Dead and of course Elvis. Dylan is doffing his hat to the genius each one of them exudes, the earliest pick dating to 1924, the most recent 2003. He is helping us do that again, having done so earlier with Theme Time Radio Hour, a series of 101 broadcasts of musings and music. The research for that radio programme helped him begin work on this book back in 2010. Here, the stories behind the songs are generously embellished with photographs, magazine covers and movie stills. It is quite a romp this coffee table labour of love, smaller in size than the regular outsized ones of the genre but surprisingly heavy. The headlines for each chapter are in bold, the font a bit loud and italicised for heft, giving the whole spread a carnivalesque feel. Not surprising since all that the little Zimmerman ever wanted to do was run away with the visiting circus party back in the day in Hibbing, Minnesota. Brevity is the soul of wit. So said the Bard who came before him. And our present day laureate adopts that maxim as he proceeds to unspool the songs he loves one by one, layer by layer. And while doing so, he is dishing out little gems _ of insights laden with profundities like only he can: \u201cMusic, like all art, including the art of romance, tells us time and again that one plus one, in the best circumstances, equals three.\u201d Or factoids that are plain hilarious: \u201cThe Fugs get their name from a Norman Mailer novel called \u2018The Naked and the Dead\u2019. When \u2018The Naked and the Dead\u2019 came out in 1948, censorship rules at the time forced Mailer to substitute the word fug for f***.\u201d The Fugs chose the name they did, opting for the \u201csafer route so the records could be purchased in a record store and not in a back alley.\u201d While peeling off  , Dylan reveals how Little Richard, always the master of the double entendre, was really singing about this gay fellow and the two gals Sue and Daisy who are both transvestites. Who would have known? Only Pat Boone, he believes. The rest sang it without ever figuring out the triumvirate\u2019s backstories. Little Richard, therefore, was a preacher and his song,   (1955), was sounding the alarm, notes Dylan in an appraisal that is deeply personal. For Little Richard was his guiding light when he was a boy, Dylan had revealed in an elegy at the time of his passing; the \u201coriginal spirit\u201d that moved Dylan to do everything he would do. Here, Little Richard is on the cover, alongside Eddy Cochran and Alis Lesley who, back in the day, was referred to as the \u201cfemale Presley\u201d.      (Bobby Bare, 1963) is a song we can all identify with. Having moved to a big city to make a life, you realise soon enough that life hasn\u2019t turned out as you hoped. You yearn for home knowing it\u2019s the one place you will be welcomed back for what you are and not what you failed to be.  (Billy Joe Shaver, 1973) is the riddle that offers the much-needed counterpoint. Keep moving. It\u2019s better to let the train keep rolling on. Well of course. That\u2019s why musicians tour. Dylan\u2019s is called The Never Ending Tour. \u201cYou give pleasure to the people and you keep your grief to yourself.\u201d Two Elvis songs find mention.   (1956) offers an opportunity for Dylan to dwell on, well, money vis-\u00e0-vis art. He is having fun. \u201cArt is a disagreement. Money is an agreement. \u2026. The only reason money is worth anything is because we agree it is,\u201d he says, citing Venezuela which declared in 2017 that it doesn\u2019t have enough money to pay for its money. \u201cBut you know what, Venezuela\u2019s still here. Because, ultimately, money doesn\u2019t matter. Nor do the things it can buy. Because no matter how many chairs you have, you only have one ass.\u201d The other Elvis track Dylan lets the needle fall on is   (1964), the ode to the gambler in the city that turns midnight into morning. It was here at the Hilton that Elvis played and sang night after night even as his health and performance deteriorated. The book is dedicated to the song\u2019s co-writer Doc Pomus, who gave up the music world\u2019s uncertain ways, but was dragged back in by the likes of B.B. King and Dr John. None of them is around. \u201cElvis, BB and Dr John are all gone,\u201d Dylan deadpans. \u201cMeanwhile, Hilton now owns thirty-one hotels in Las Vegas. The house always wins. Viva Las Vegas.\u201d Revelations, warnings, stories, music industry gossip and nuggets of history, Dylan\u2019s Philosophy of Modern Song (Simon & Schuster), his first book of new writing since 2004\u2019s Chronicles: Volume One and since winning the Literature Nobel in 2016, is replete with all and more. It also draws a few conclusions. With Dylan, the self-professed song and dance man, these are sweeping. Naturally. Hence, Grateful Dead is essentially a dance band playing for an audience that is also part of the band. Let\u2019s not forget (can we ever?) Dylan has toured with the Dead. So you better believe him when he explains why Dead is unsurpassable, citing the presence of the jazz classical bassist, Phil Lesh, and the Elvin Jones-influenced Bill Kreutzmann. Lesh is described as one of the most skilled bassists in subtlety and invention, who combined with Kreutzmann, helms a rhythm section that is hard to beat. Then there\u2019s Bob Weir, whom he calls an unorthodox rhythm player banking on strange, augmented chords that somehow match Jerry Garcia\u2019s guitar. With elements of traditional rock and roll and American folk music, the Dead, with three main singers, two drummers and triple harmonies, is difficult to compete with. \u201cA post-modern jazz musical rock and roll dynamo.\u201d On Bobby Darin, whose   (1959) is described as a murderous ballad from The Three Penny Opera, Dylan is sympathetic. Darin was in the Frank Sinatra mould but not quite. The world could only stand one Frank, he says. \u201cNobody could follow that road. Not Tony, not Dean, and certainly not Bobby Darin.\u201d About   (1966), Dylan reveals Sinatra hated it. Even though that was the song which toppled the Billboard Hot 100 charts in 1966, unseating some of the iconic representatives of the British invasion, like   (The Beatles) and   (Rolling Stones). There is a twist in the tale when it comes to the writer of the song, which had gone through at least two sets of lyrics with many staking claim to its authorship. Dylan presents the entire story, without vouching for its veracity. In short, it\u2019s about this Armenian pianist and composer, a Beiruti immigrant who was living in New York at the time, courtesy Iran\u2019s Shah Rehza Pahlavi. Other claimants include a Croatian singer and a French composer. Tying up these various strands is the Avo Xo, a Dominican cigar, over two million of which are sold every year now. Go figure. So, what makes a good song? Dylan offers clues. A big part is editing, distilling down to essentials. Look for the artistry in what is unsaid. Don\u2019t fall for the trap of easy rhymes, like revolution/evolution/air pollution, he adds, but clarifies that only in the hands of a John Lennon can a \u201cpost-modern campfire song [ ]\u201d come to life with dogma descriptions such as \u2018bag-ism, shag-ism\u2019. Yet, if there was anyone who could pull off so-called moon/June songs with aplomb, it would be Frank Sinatra. He could break people\u2019s hearts with his renditions even though putting melody to personal diary entries doesn\u2019t quite guarantee a hit song. Dylan would know, having reprised a bunch of Sinatra classics in his own album Shadows in the Night (2015). Dylan is also taking a swipe at those who often try to read lyrics deadpan to squirm at their apparent lack of profundity, highlighting how melody is crucial for the words to open up and bestow in them meaning and purpose. Like in, say, Peter Green\u2019s   (1970), first featured in the Santana album Abraxas, the words don\u2019t exactly leap out of the page _ \u201cIn two of the three six-line verses, one of the lines is repeated four times.\u201d Yet, in the hands of Carlos Santana\u2019s guitar played to Latin polyrhythms, the song instantly becomes what it is meant to be: the irresistible seduction of this out-of-body femme-fatale or unseemly creature with dark powers. Part of the joy of reading Philosophy of Modern Song is Dylan\u2019s writing.  Alternating between smooth and jagged, it reminds us of the musical meter of his 2020 studio album Rough and Rowdy Ways. Most sentences are short and pithy. But when they are long, they\u2019re playful, alive, heart-melting. \u201cHe dips down to a low baritone and then goes up into that high tenor\u2026 he hits a high note as pure and as clean as a mountain stream,\u201d he says about Johnny Paycheck\u2019s rendition of  (1986). At times though Dylan ends up repeating himself, but it matters little since it is another song, another story and another time he\u2019s describing. The book is one long, very long, song. The chapters are the verses. They are of uneven length, meant to be read in varying tempo, holding forth on music pertaining to a time that has long gone. Yet it is music, and therefore, timeless. What does the Philosophy of Modern Song mean to someone growing up outside of America, say in the sub-continent that wears, albeit lightly, its own mashup of musical history? The palette of songs that Dylan uses to paint this mural in tribute is not all made of familiar colour and sound _ there are several in his selection that I didn\u2019t know of. Thankfully though, all the songs he covers are floating about in the streaming universe waiting to be clicked on. And played. As I did. We can all listen to them if we choose to and relive some of the stories and events as they are said to have happened. Dylan is opening new doors, leading us up the garden path to a nursery of rhyme, song and slices of history. It is for us to tune in. Maybe even sing out loud.",

        "Article Content": "Writing to his sweetheart Barbara Ann Hewitt, a young man then named Robert Zimmerman discussed his dream to sell a million records one day. He would go on to sell 125 million. A collection of personal letters written by a young Bob Dylan to a high school girlfriend has fetched almost $670,000 (around \u20ac650,000) at auction this week. A renowned Portuguese book shop, the Livraria Lello in Porto, bought the collection of 42 handwritten letters totaling 150 pages. It plans to keep the archive available for Dylan fans and scholars to study, auctioneer RR Auction said in a statement on Friday. The sale was completed on Thursday, with the letters the centerpiece and most expensive lot among a series of young-Dylan effects and memorabilia sold. Dylan, a native of Hibbing, Minnesota, wrote the letters to Barbara Ann Hewitt between 1957 and 1959. At the time he was still known as Bob Zimmerman. They provide an insight into a period of his life of which not much is known. RR Auctions' executive vice president, Bobby Livingstone, said you could see in the letters \"the transformation of Bob Zimmerman into Bob Dylan.\" Dylan discusses his plans to change his name and his dream of selling a million records in some of the letters. The 81-year-old Nobel Literature Prize laureate has sold roughly 125 million in a career lasting more than six decades. The young musician often expresses his affection for Hewitt, invites her to a Buddy Holly concert, shares fragments of his poetry, and discusses issues ranging from cars to clothes and music. Hewitt's daughter found the letters after her mother died in 2020. Each letter was accompanied by a handwritten envelope usually including the name Bob. Other items auctioned this week included a selection of 24 poems Dylan wrote while studying at the University of Minnesota, which fetched almost $250,000, and one of the earliest known signed photographs of the singer that went for more than $24,000.",

        "Article Content": "People across all age groups in India, both men and women, are consuming inadequate amounts of micronutrients critical for health, including iron, calcium and folate, as estimated in a study published in The Lancet Global Health journal. The study is the first to provide estimates of insufficient consumption of 15 micronutrients across 185 countries, taken through diets without the use of supplements, according to an international team, including researchers from Harvard University, US. The findings suggested that around the world, almost 70 per cent, or over five billion, people do not consume enough iodine, vitamin E, and calcium. The researchers also found that within a country and an age group, more women were consuming inadequate amounts of iodine, vitamin B12 and iron, compared to men, whereas more men were consuming inadequate amounts of magnesium, vitamin B6, zinc and vitamin C, compared to women. In India, while more women consumed insufficient amounts of iodine, compared to men, more men consumed inadequate amounts of zinc and magnesium, compared to women, the team found. While analyses over the past 10 years have looked at micronutrient deficiencies, the researchers said large data gaps remain for many micronutrients and population groups. In this study, the authors used publicly available data from the Global Dietary Database to estimate the prevalence of insufficient nutrient intakes for 99.3 per cent of the global population. Men and women aged 10-30 years were most prone to low-levels of calcium intake, especially in South Asia, Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the team said. The authors said that the findings could be used by public health professionals to target populations in need of dietary interventions. They added that since they did not account for intake of fortified foods or supplements, the results could possibly be an overestimate for some key nutrients in particular locations where people consume high amounts of fortified foods and supplements.

        "Article Content": "There isn't much left to say about Bob Dylan that hasn't already been said. Dylan turns 82 on Wednesday, May 24. And on June 2, he resumes his Rough and Rowdy Ways Tour in Europe. But, as with preceding tours, not many fans will be able capture these live shows. Dylan prohibits the use of smartphones and cameras inside concert halls. According to his long-time manager Jeff Rosen, Bob believes in the \u201cephemeral nature\u201d of live performances. One hopes Dylan\u2019s team is recording these concerts for future release as yet another \u201cofficial\u201d Bootleg series, a tradition that caters to legions of Dylan loyalists by putting out never-before-heard studio sessions, concert outtakes and other unreleased material. Dylan\u2019s habit of leaving out some of his best songs from his studio albums has agonised and befuddled fans for ages. The reasonsbehind these exclusions are known only to him. Not even his band members and session musicians have a clue. Hence, to commemorate this special day, here are 10 outtakes I wish he hadn\u2019t discarded. I wish   was included in place of  said Dylan\u2019s violinist Scarlet Rivera who played on his 17 studio album Desire and the Rolling Thunder Revue Tour, during a video call with The Telegraph Online. Of course! Rivera\u2019s violin perfectly underlining the fantastic melody of the song and Dylan\u2019s thought-provoking lyrics will make you want to listen to this one on a loop. In 2020, when artist Ranjit Kumar Das was painting a Bob Dylan mural on Purna Das Road in Calcutta, I asked him to include this line from the song:  . This is a piece of wisdom that has been preached by many, but Dylan says it the best. An outtake from Dylan\u2019s 21st studio albumShot of Love (1981), Caribbean Wind is one of his great unfinished masterpieces. London-based broadcaster Laura Tenschert, who hosts a radio show called Definitely Dylan, devoted an entire episode talking about the various versions of this song, each with a different set of lyrics. Another Dylanologist, Rob Kelly, did an episode on the song on his podcast series Pod Dylan. Here\u2019s my favourite version which saw the light of day in 1985 as part of the box-set release, Biograph. In 2018, when the Take 1 of this outtake from the 1975 album Blood on the Tracks was included in the six-disc deluxe version of the compilation More Blood, More Tracks, the 14th installment of Bob Dylan\u2019s Bootleg series, one of the many people who were left in awe American rapper Kanye West!Hetweetedthe lyrics and extended an open invitation to Dylan for collaborating. I can see why he was amazed. Again, an excellent melody paired with brilliant lyrics. Dylan sings with absolute honesty:  . There is a long list of individuals, including artists and stalwarts in other domains such as Steve Jobs, who have directly or indirectly pointed to Dylan as the inspiration behind their own creative energy. Martin Scorsese is one such. He is known to be a colossal admirer of Dylan\u2019s work. So much so, he went on to make two documentaries on him:   (2005) and the 2019 Netflix release,  . Scorsese is said to be a great admirer of this outtake of Blind , from Infidels(1983), Dylan\u2019s 22  studio album, which was produced by Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits). Dylan chose to perform this song to pay tribute to Scorsese at a 2012 event organised in honour of the filmmaker. But, Dylan being Dylan, it was a completely different version which finally made it to Scorsese\u2019s PBS documentary series The Blues. Another gorgeous outtake from the Infidels sessions with Knopfler on the guitar \u2013 great voice, lovely lyrics and a pretty melody. Here\u2019s one more from the Infidels sessions with masterful storytelling, but kept under wraps for almost four decades. Wonder how incredible this already great record would have been had these songs not been dropped, right? According to Clinton Heylin, who has written extensively on Dylan, this song is one of three new originals Dylan was threatening to play on his 1984 tour of European stadiums. The song was worked on a number of times at rehearsals, of which recordings remain, but was never performed or recorded later. This lyrically moving song from the October 1963 sessions for his third album The Times They Are A-Changin' was made known to the general public when American folk singer Joan Baez played it in the 1967 Dylan-themed documentary  . Dylan fingerpicking the guitar beautifully supports and punctuates the lyrics. This wonderful catchy song written and recorded in 1971, but released 20 years later as part of The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991, would have been an anthem for all the introverted and socially awkward people (like myself), had it been popular. Despite having a rough draft of the lyrics, and a fair idea of the chords and melody, looks like this amazing song never fully came to fruition. Thankfully, there\u2019s a recording from 1986 with Eric Clapton on guitar.",

        "Article Content": "As Bob Dylan turns 82, the questions keep piling up. Why is he still on the road? And why is he hiding behind a piano on stage while singing his songs?  Why, why, why? Who? When? Will we ever know? No. He told us long before with his  : Something\u2019s happening here and you don\u2019t know what it is, do you, Mister Jones? But we keep trying, looking for clues to what\u2019s going on in his mind; in his songs of course, but also in his books, Philosophy of Modern Song (2022), his first since Chronicles: Volume One (2004). A long time ago, he called himself \u201ca song and dance man\u201d. We may claim to know of his songs. But the dance? Here\u2019s a selection from Dylan\u2019s writing to try and unravel some of the inner workings of his mind, the waltzing of his thoughts on an array of topics that are all very close to his heart: youngsters of today, God, religion, movies and his first love, America; but starting with the \u201cgreat betrayal\u201d, his electrifying turnaround in the sixties. As for me, what I did to break away was to take simple folk changes and put new imagery and attitude to them, use catchphrases and metaphor combined with a new set of ordinances that evolved into something different that had not been heard before. Silber (Irwin, editor of folk magazine Still Out!) scolded me in his letter for doing this, as if he alone and a few others had the keys to the real world. I knew what I was doing, though, and wasn\u2019t going to take a step back or retreat for anybody.      We all rail at the previous generation but somehow know it\u2019s only a matter of time until we will become them ourselves\u2026 Each generation seems to have the arrogance of ignorance, opting to throw out what has gone before instead of building on the past. Every generation gets to pick and choose what they want from the generation that came before with the same arrogance and ego-driven self-importance that the previous generations had when they picked the bones of the ones before them. One of the reasons people turn away from God is because religion is no longer in the fabric of their lives. It is presented as a thing that must be journeyed to as a chore __ it\u2019s Sunday, we have to go to church. Or, it is used as a weapon of threat by political nutjobs on either side of every argument. Sometimes the difference between religion and science can be measured in the distance between the unanswered and the unanswerable question. People live in fear. For instance, at the end of the day when the sun disappeared people were afraid it might never come back. Religion calmed them with a solution to the unanswerable question __ the Greek god Helios dragged the sun across the sky every morning in a golden chariot. It was his job, he would do it every day, and that calmed the fear of living in darkness. Time passed and science made discoveries and unanswerable questions began to get answered. The Earth spun on its axis and revolved around the sun. Helios retired. Today it is commonplace to stream a movie directly to your phone. So, when you are watching Gloria Swanson as faded movie star Norma Desmond proclaim from the palm of your hand, \u201cI am big, it\u2019s the pictures that got small,\u201d it contains layers of irony that writer/director Billy Wilder could never have imagined. Of course, someone streaming something to their phone is most likely watching something even shorter (than a movie) and faster paced on TikTok, certainly not anything in black and white with a running time of 110 minutes. America has always been a great melting pot but there are a few things that have been created here and then given back to the world. As much fun as it is to drive a Ferrari, Detroit will always be the automobile\u2019s home. As good a player as Stephane Grappelli is, you have to go back to King Oliver, Buddy Bolden, and Louis Armstrong to find the beating heart of jazz. Likewise, Fellini. Kurosawa, and their counterparts around the world have made some terrific movies but we all know where the film industry got its first slap on the ass and drew its initial breath. People keep talking about making America great again. Maybe they should start with the movies.   That we are always deep in a gigantic, colossal mess, and some big idiot is telling us to push on. But so it is with music, it is of a time but also timeless: a thing with which to make memories and the memory itself. Though we seldom consider it, music is built in time as surely as a sculptor or welder works in physical space. Music transcends time by living within it, just as reincarnation allows us to transcend life by living it again and again.",

        "Article Content": "Is there anyone who does not take any medicine? At least pop a Pan D before heading to a wedding feast?\u201d A doctor asked an audience that smiled knowingly. The interaction was taking place at the Biomedical Science Centre at IB Block on the widespread habit of taking medicines without proper consultation, on the rational and irrational use of drugs and on antibiotic resistance. \u201cThe WHO in 1985 defined the rational use of medicine as when individual patients receive appropriate, individualistic medicines tailored to their clinical needs in doses that meet their specific requirements. This includes the right selection of medicine, procurement, storage, prescribing, dispensing, monitoring, and feedback to ensure drug safety and efficacy,\u201d explained Suhrita Paul, then the officer on special duty at the state department of health and currently the principal of Barasat Medical College and Hospital. The FE Block resident highlighted the consequences of incorrect doses, improper administration, and the dangers of drugs with unproven efficacy such as antioxidants, vitamins, tonics, mental boosters, memory enhancers, or drugs with uncertain safety statuses, like anabolic steroids. \u201cMedicines should be taken only when there is an actual requirement. There must be proper diagnosis and adequate monitoring of the patient,\u201d she said. Paul cautioned about the co-administration of drugs, explaining how sometimes people need to visit different specialists for different complications. \u201cBut a lack of co-ordination in treatment can lead to the different drugs having reactions in the body, especially in the geriatric age group. It is important to keep track of the drugs prescribed by other doctors to avoid this. Some people do not complete their doses due to lack of awareness, information, and funds. This is also harmful,\u201d she explained. Paul repeated a warning made by Alexander Fleming, who discovered the first antibiotic penicillin in 1929. \u201cAt his 1945 Nobel Prize ceremony, Fleming had said that a time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in shops. Then there is a danger that the ignorant may easily under-dose himself, and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug, make them resistant,\u201d she noted. Before prescribing antibiotics, it is essential to consider whether they are necessary, as not all fevers or infections are bacterial. The choice of the most appropriate antibiotic, the correct dose, frequency, route, and duration are crucial for effective treatment. Bacteria become resistant through various changes, often linked to the overuse of antibiotics in animals. Drug-resistant bacteria can spread to humans via food, the environment, or direct contact, with poor hygiene and unclean facilities exacerbating the problem. Effective measures include surveillance to prevent misuse, increased public awareness, vaccination, infection control, stringent policies, and the preference for rapidly acting, narrow-spectrum antibiotics. \u201cAntibiotic resistance is an urgent global health threat,\u201d said Paul. \u201cTo become an antibiotic guardian, everyone has to play a role. Political will and enlightened bureaucracy alone are not enough.\"",

        "Article Content": "The Indian government adopted the policy of 'One Nation, One Policy' for organ donation and transplantation and also started the consultation process with the states in the matter, a senior health ministry official said on Friday.  \"Organ donation needs to become a way of life for us so that we can give a new lease of life to those suffering from organ failure,\" said L. S. Changsan, Additional Secretary in the Union Health Ministry of Health.  Changsan made the remarks as she inaugurated a deliberation on 'Reforms required for augmentation of organ and tissue donation and transplantation in terms of Technology, Processes and Legislation in India' here today.  \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has highlighted the importance of organ donation in his Mann Ki Baat programme and emphasised on the fact that one person donating organs after death can give a new lease of life to up to eight patients suffering from various organ failures,\" she said.  She also stressed on the need to promote organ donation from deceased persons to meet the huge need for organ donation in the country.   Changsan said that the ministry's focus was to improve the availability of infrastructure and trained manpower for organ transplantation, especially in government institutions.  The Centre has already initiated Organ Donation Public Awareness Campaign under the title 'Angdaan Jan Jagrukta Abhiyaan,' actively underway in several states and institutions.  Dr Atul Goel, Director General Health Service (DGHS), said that the NOTTO had taken the lead in the field of organ and tissue transplant in India and the deliberation underway in the national capital provides an opportunity for introspection on putting systems in place.  \"In our nation we have had a tradition of giving i.e. altruism. While we have live donations, we need to encourage deceased donations as much as possible both in government and private hospitals,\" he said.  The two-day Chintan Shivir will cover ten important themes concerning organ donation and transplantation and various sub-themes.  The objectives for the Chintan Shivir are to discuss the reforms required for augmenting organ and tissue donation and transplantation besides exploring and discussing advancements in technology that can improve organ donation and allocation processes.  The aim is to propose recommendations for legislative reforms in order to strengthen the existing legal framework related to organ donation and transplantation.",

        "Article Content": "A blood test measuring fats in serum could help predict if weight loss will be effective in helping a pre-diabetic patient manage blood sugar levels, according to a new study. Pre-diabetics are individuals whose blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not yet in the diabetic range. Analysing fats in blood serum, researchers at the University of Sydney, Australia, found that while weight loss through dieting significantly impacted several types of lipids (fats), changes in different fats affected different types of blood sugar. For example, changes in fasting blood sugar were linked to certain sphingolipids -- a type of fat found in a cell's outer layer -- while those in HbA1c, insulin and insulin resistance were linked to other fats in blood serum. \"Six baseline bioactive sphingolipids primarily predicted changes in fasting plasma glucose. In addition, a number of baseline lipid species, mainly diacylglycerols and triglycerides, were predictive of clinical changes in hemoglobin A1c, insulin and HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance),\" the authors wrote. Weight loss through a low-energy diet -- low-carb, fibre-rich -- is commonly recommended to help pre-diabetic people bring blood sugar levels back to normal. However, the researchers said that over half of these individuals do not achieve normal blood sugar levels afterwards. They found that measuring certain fats in serum before one loses weight could predict which type of blood sugar will improve following weight loss. The findings are published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. \"Our findings reveal that certain fats in the blood can tell us a lot about a person's chances of improving their blood sugar levels through weight loss,\" lead author Yanfei (Jacob) Qi from the university's Centenary Institute said. For the study, blood serum samples from 104 pre-diabetic participants were analysed before and after they started a low-energy diet for eight weeks. In this duration, the individuals were found to have lost at least eight per cent of their body weight. Lipidomics -- the use of AI-based techniques to study changes in hundreds of different lipids -- was used in analysing the serum samples. \"(The findings) could be a game-changer in how we approach diabetes prevention, allowing us to personalise treatment plans for those who are less likely to benefit from standard diet recommendations,\" Qi said.",

        "Article Content": "Biofeedback training can unleash human potential and enhance performance, something I have experienced while working with top-tier athletes. Let\u2019s delve into the principles that form the foundation of biofeedback training. We will explore the methods and practices utilised by athletes and coaches in this field. We will also examine the outcomes attained by athletes who employ this method and evaluate its availability for committed gym enthusiasts, collegiate athletes and club-level players. \n       Biofeedback training is a method that uses real-time feedback to assist individuals in comprehending their body\u2019s responses during exercise, stress, or other stimuli. With heightened awareness, individuals are able to effectively regulate their responses, resulting in reduced fatigue levels and an overall boost in well-being. The training process consists of several crucial stages. After that, the next step involves placing sensors on the individual\u2019s body to monitor their reactions. This can include a wide range of things, including: \uf0df EEG sensors for monitoring brain activity \uf0df EMG sensors for tracking muscle activity \uf0df HRV sensors for monitoring heart rate and blood pressure \uf0df State-of-the-art skin conductance sensors for monitoring sweat levels \uf0df Techniques for improving breathing \uf0df Exercises for relaxing muscles \uf0df Engaging games that test attention During activities such as squats, the software provides immediate feedback on your body\u2019s response. This feedback can be provided through auditory signals such as graphs or sounds, which indicate any changes in your body\u2019s responses. Following the workout, the data collected by sensors will be carefully analysed using specialised software. This analysis can provide valuable insights into patterns and trends in your body\u2019s reactions, allowing you to identify your strengths and areas for improvement. After conducting a thorough analysis, the biofeedback trainer will provide you with tailored feedback and guidance using your performance data. This may involve customised exercises, techniques for better breathing, and other strategies to improve your body\u2019s responses. There are different experts who can provide biofeedback training, including physicians who specialise in sports medicine, physical therapists who focus on sports medicine or orthopaedics, and occupational therapists who specialise in sports medicine or rehabilitation. Experts in the field of sports psychology can offer specialised training to enhance performance and mental resilience. \n       While biofeedback training has demonstrated potential for improving sports performance and reducing fatigue, it is important to consider the challenges and limitations associated with it. \uf0df The price of biofeedback equipment can be quite steep, making it difficult for certain individuals to afford it. \uf0df \uf0df \uf0df \n       An example of the effectiveness of biofeedback training is demonstrated by the experience of Olympic champion swimmer Katie Ledecky. Ledecky has openly discussed her use of biofeedback training to overcome her anxiety and fatigue problems during competitions. With extensive training, Ledecky developed a deep understanding of her body\u2019s responses and mastered the art of effectively managing them. She demonstrated exceptional skill and dedication, leading to her remarkable accomplishments in the pool. Another example involves renowned tennis player Serena Williams, who has discussed how she integrated training to improve her focus and mental strength during matches. Through the use of biofeedback training, Williams developed a deep understanding of how her body responds. She developed a strong skill in managing them. Her ability to stay focused and driven in high-pressure situations has been instrumental in her successes at Grand Slam events. football clubs are embracing it\n       Top-tier Premier League teams have incorporated biofeedback training into their efforts to enhance performance. For example, the coaching staff at Manchester City has introduced specialised training to help their players develop mental resilience and enhance their focus during matches. In addition, Liverpool FC\u2019s coaching team has implemented biofeedback training techniques to assist their players in improving their recovery and regeneration strategies after matches. \n       Many well-known tennis and basketball stars have also incorporated training into their performance enhancement programmes. As an illustration, tennis sensation Novak Djokovic has shared insights into how he integrates training to enhance his focus and mental resilience during matches. Stephen Curry, the renowned basketball player, has shared insights into his approach to training, which he believes is crucial for improving shooting accuracy and mental resilience during games. \n       While biofeedback training may seem complex or geared towards athletes, it is actually accessible to anyone looking to enhance their performance or combat fatigue. Whether you are a gym enthusiast, a college athlete, or part of a sports club, biofeedback training can be tailored to meet your specific needs and goals. Many reputable fitness centres and gyms now include biofeedback training sessions as part of their group workout programmes. These sessions usually involve a set of exercises that aim to test an individual\u2019s responses. Feedback is given on various metrics such as heart rate variability, EEG activity, and more. \n       Many high-level athletes have incorporated biofeedback training into their performance optimisation strategies, including champions, top-tier soccer teams and well-known tennis and basketball players. Through biofeedback training, you can develop a greater understanding and mastery of your body\u2019s responses, allowing you to have more control over how it reacts.\n       \n        ",

        "Article Content": "How you wear your hair is often about more than looking and feeling good. For some people, a hairstyle is a form of self-expression, making a little pain seem worthwhile. For others, it\u2019s a way to feel connected to cultural heritage, said Dr Victoria Barbosa, an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Chicago in the US. And sometimes, slicked-back buns or styles like summertime braids, which are meant to safeguard your hair from damage, are just convenient, she said. But any hairdo that involves tugging can trigger what experts call external-traction headaches; and consistent tension can lead to hair loss. \u201cNo one wants to spend their hard-earned money, often hundreds of dollars, on a style that they then have to take down prematurely,\u201d Dr Barbosa said. How tight hairstyles trigger headaches\n       External-traction headaches \u2014 which experts previously called ponytail headaches \u2014 are primarily felt where hair is pulled, said Dr Susan Broner, a neurologist at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, US. Wearing a high ponytail, for instance, may cause your crown to hurt, while newly installed cornrows could lead to pain across your scalp. These hairstyles can trigger sensitive nerve endings on the scalp, said Dr Annie Shea, a neurologist at the University of Michigan Health, US. But the hairstyles won\u2019t cause long-term nerve damage, she said. In most cases, you should feel better within an hour of loosening your hair. To avoid these headaches altogether, Dr Shea suggested opting for looser styles. If you need to get hair out of your face, such as during a workout or while cooking, she recommended hair clips and soft headbands. If you\u2019re wearing tight braids, it\u2019s harder to let your hair down. Box braids \u2014 installed by parting hair into sections, or boxes, and braiding each one \u2014 put tension on hair roots because they typically involve placing hair extensions right at the scalp. Knotless braids feed extensions into the braids in a way that causes less tension, Dr Barbosa said. In situations where looser styles aren\u2019t possible, Dr Shea suggested taking a pain medication like ibuprofen before a hair appointment, or even after the pain sets in. Still, it\u2019s important to tell your braider if you\u2019re in pain as your hair is being styled, Dr Barbosa said, \u201cbecause once the style is in, of course someone can take pain medicine, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the style is too tight\u201d. Any style that adds friction or tension to the hair can cause it to snap. Regularly using hair ties, for instance, means elastic bands rub against hair \u201clike a little knife\u201d, Dr Barbosa said. Traction alopecia, a type of hair loss caused by constant pulling at the hair root, is another risk. Early on, this may look like a receding hairline or patches of hair loss. It may also appear as \u201cacne bumps or flaking on the scalp\u201d, said  Dr Jordan Talia, an assistant professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai in the US. For people who continue to wear styles that pull at their hair, the condition can worsen, causing scar tissue that may destroy the hair follicle and leave skin shiny and bald. Anyone can experience traction alopecia, but it\u2019s most prevalent among Black women, specifically those who wear styles with tension, Dr Barbosa explained. Though it\u2019s unclear why, the risk may also increase for people who have chemically straightened hair, experts said. \u201cIt is such a common problem that, even though it\u2019s not normal, it has become the norm,\u201d Dr Barbosa said. There are treatment options to manage traction alopecia: in the early stages, a dermatologist may prescribe a topical steroid, or inject steroids into a patient\u2019s scalp to decrease inflammation and prevent scarring, Dr Talia said. And they might also recommend minoxidil (Rogaine), an over-the-counter topical medication that stimulates hair growth. Oral minoxidil is also available by prescription, which dermatologists use as an off-label therapy for the condition, Dr Barbosa added. (The US Food and Drug Administration hasn\u2019t approved any medications for traction alopecia specifically, but topical minoxidil is approved for female as well as male- pattern baldness.) For those with permanent hair loss, hair transplants \u2014 which involve harvesting healthy hair follicles from skin on the scalp and transplanting them to where new hair is desired \u2014 may be an option, Dr Barbosa said, though the procedure can cost thousands of dollars. In general, Dr Barbosa recommended that people avoid tight styles. When it comes to protective styles like box braids or cornrows, she suggested wearing them only once or twice a year, and for no longer than six weeks at a time. These styles might protect hair \u201cbecause you\u2019re not having the breakage associated with frequent hair styling\u201d, but they could be damaging your follicles, she said. \u201cProtective hairstyles are not always so protective.\u201d \n      ",

        "Article Content": "q I often wake up with a stiff neck. It is uncomfortable, and I find it difficult to turn my head. It can happen if you work or sit with your head tilted slightly in front of your shoulders. This stresses the muscles at the back of the neck and between the shoulder blades. Overuse (particularly computer time) leads to injury, chronic depletion of chemicals, pain and fatigue. You could try taking an analgesic like paracetamol or an NSAID like ibuprofen. Apply heat or ice (whichever feels better) to the area and stretch. An easy stretch is to bend your head down to look into your left armpit. Hold the position for a count of 20. Repeat five times. This stretches the muscles that run from the bottom of your skull to the shoulder blade. Repeat the stretch on the other side. Grey hair\n      q I am 35 years old and going grey fast. I have had some stressful events in my life. Is the greying because of that? Although some studies do show that stressful events can deplete a body chemical called noradrenaline, which leads to a loss of pigment cells in the hair turning it white, grey hair is more likely to be genetic. It can also be due to deficiencies in iron, calcium, vitamins B12 and D, thyroid deficiency and smoking. Get yourself checked for these deficiencies. Shoulder pain\n      q My shoulder hurt so I went to an orthopaedic surgeon. After X-rays, he said there was nothing wrong with the joint. Shoulder pain, especially on one side, may not arise from the shoulder itself. It may be due to diabetes. This is a fairly common condition called a \u201cfrozen shoulder\u201d. So, check your blood sugar level. It may also be due to elevated uric acid levels. It can be referred pain due to problems in the neck bones, heart disease or even gallbladder disease. If your shoulder joint is completely normal, get a complete evaluation done for the other issues. Pills that stick \n      q Whenever I take tablets, I feel that they stick in my throat. I am 25 years old. Oval and heavier pills pass through more easily than capsules or smaller, lighter pills. When you feel that the pills stick, you may be right. Capsules of antibiotics are particularly likely to cause problems. Always have at least half a cup of water when you swallow medication and sit up straight for at least 10 minutes afterwards. Sleep aid\n      q I have difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. I heard about melatonin. Is it safe? I don\u2019t want to become addicted to sleeping tablets. We can sleep at night and stay awake during the day because our brain works on a circadian rhythm or internal clock, which is influenced by sunlight. The circadian rhythm is controlled by a hormone called melatonin, the levels of which vary with light and darkness. Its production decreases with increasing age, jetlag, or night shifts. This hormone is available as a OTC tablet. Long-term use is not advised. Use it only until your rhythm is reset. It is contraindicated in pregnant and lactating mothers or if there is an autoimmune disease or epilepsy. Heat blister\n      q I developed a blister on my hand after I touched a hot vessel. What should I do? If the fluid inside the blister is clear, it is not infected. Do not pop it; the liquid will be reabsorbed by itself. If it bursts on its own, wash it with soap and water and then apply an antibiotic ointment, such as neosporin or mupirocin. Try to leave it open as much as possible. If the surrounding skin is red, there is pain or the contents are cloudy, you may need antibiotics. Please consult a physician.",

        "Article Content": "Scientists have made the skin on the skulls and abdomens of mice transparent using a common yellow food colouring in landmark experiments that they say could open a new window into the human body. The researchers at Stanford University in the US announced on Thursday that a mixture of water and the food colour called tartrazine has the effect of reversibly making the skin, muscle and connective tissues transparent in live mice. Their study describing their experiments was published in the US journal   on Friday. The technique that combines dye chemistry and optics has allowed the researchers to observe blood vessels on the surface of the brain through the transparent skull skin and internal organs and muscle contractions in the digestive tract through the transparent abdomen skin. \u201cFor those who understand the physics behind this, it makes sense, but if you aren\u2019t familiar with it, it looks like a magic trick,\u201d said Zihao Ou, now an assistant professor of physics at the University of Texas, Dallas, and the study\u2019s first author. The researchers hypothesised that certain molecules have the capacity to induce optical transparency to biological tissues, their theoretical calculations pointing to tartrazine. In preliminary experiments, they observed that tartrazine molecules, when dissolved in water, order themselves in a structure that prevents the scattering of light, resulting in transparency. After first testing the technique on thin slices of chicken breast, the scientists applied the tartrazine solution on the scalps to observe blood vessels in the brain and on the abdomen to see contractions of the intestine and movement caused by heartbeats and breathing. The scientists have not tested the technique yet on humans whose skin is about 10 times thicker than that of mice. At this time, Ou said, it is unclear what dosage of the dye would be necessary to penetrate the entire thickness of the human skin. If the technique also works on human skin, it could make veins more visible for drawing blood, said Guosong Hong, assistant professor of materials science at Stanford University who led the research. Hong also said the technique may help make laser-based tattoo removal easier. The research began as part of efforts to investigate how microwave radiation interacts with biological tissues. During this process, the scientists noted two key concepts in optics that deal with how atoms and electrons respond within molecules as light passes through them. Those concepts served as the foundation for theoretical calculations on how dye molecules might interact with biological tissues and lead to temporary optical transparency. ",

        "Article Content": "Move over, body mass index. Make room for roundness \u2014 to be precise, the body roundness index. The body mass index, or BMI, is a ratio of height to weight that has long been used as a medical screening tool. It is one of the most widely used health metrics but also one of the most reviled, because it is used to label people overweight, obese or extremely obese. The classifications have been questioned by athletes including American Olympic rugby player Ilona Maher, whose BMI of 30 technically puts her on the cusp of obesity. \u201cBut alas,\u201d she said on Instagram, addressing online trolls who tried to shame her about her weight, \u201cI\u2019m going to the Olympics and you\u2019re not.\u201d Advocates for overweight individuals and people of color note that the formula was developed nearly 200 years ago and based exclusively on data from men, most of them white, and that it was never intended for medical screening. Even physicians have weighed in on the shortcomings of BMI. The American Medical Association warned last year that BMI is an imperfect metric that doesn\u2019t account for racial, ethnic, age, sex and gender diversity. It can\u2019t differentiate between individuals who carry a lot of muscle and those with fat in all the wrong places. \u201cBased on BMI, Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was a bodybuilder would have been categorized as obese and needing to lose weight,\u201d said Dr. Wajahat Mehal, director of the Metabolic Health and Weight Loss Program at Yale University. \u201cBut as soon as you measured his waist, you\u2019d see, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s 32 inches.\u2019\u201d So, welcome a new metric: the body roundness index. BRI is just what it sounds like \u2014 a measure of how round or circlelike you are, using a formula that takes into account height and waist, but not weight. It\u2019s a formula that may provide a better estimate of central obesity and abdominal fat, which are closely linked to an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and heart disease, unlike fat stored on the buttocks and thighs. A paper published in JAMA Network Open in June was the latest in a string of studies to report that BRI is a promising predictor of mortality. BRI scores generally run from 1 to 15; most people rank between 1 and 10. Among a nationally representative sample of 33,000 Americans, BRI scores rose between 1999 and 2018, the new study found. Those with BRI scores of 6.9 and up \u2014 indicating the roundest bodies \u2014 were at the highest risk of dying from cancer, heart disease and other illnesses. Their overall mortality risk was almost 50% greater than those with BRIs of 4.5 to 5.5, which were in the midrange of the sample, while those with BRI scores of 5.46 to 6.9 faced a risk that was 25% higher than those in the midrange. But those who were least round were also at elevated risk of death: People with BRI scores under 3.41 also faced a mortality risk that was 25% higher than those in the midrange, the study found. The paper\u2019s authors suggested that the lower scores, seen mostly in those 65 and older, might have reflected malnutrition, muscle atrophy or inactivity. \u201cBMI cannot distinguish body fat from muscle mass,\u201d Wenquan Niu, who works at the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at the Capital Institute of Pediatrics in Beijing and was a senior author of the paper, wrote in an email. \u201cFor any given BMI, fat distribution and body composition can vary dramatically.\u201d Indeed, Niu wrote, \u201cWhen BMI is used to frame risk, it often overestimates risk for muscular athletes, whereas it underestimates risk for older persons with muscle mass that\u2019s been replaced by fat.\u201d The fat stored in the abdominal cavity is critically important, as it surrounds internal organs such as the liver, and contributes to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance that often precede Type 2 diabetes. It also fosters high blood pressure and lipid abnormalities that can lead to heart disease and death. \u201cExcessive visceral fat deposition is just like a silent killer lurking in our body, which can sneak up on a person over years with few noticeable symptoms, especially among apparently lean people,\u201d Niu said. BRI is the brainchild of mathematician Diana Thomas, now a professor at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. She first described it in a 2013 paper in the journal Obesity. Although BMI is grounded in the geometry of a cylinder, Thomas said, she was looking in the mirror one day and thought to herself,: \u201cI\u2019m not a cylinder \u2014 I\u2019m kind of more an egg. I have hips that make me more like an egg. How do I capture that?\u201d \u201cIn pre-calculus, you learn about eccentricity \u2014 how close to a circle you are,\u201d she said. \u201cDifferent people can be categorized as different ellipses. Some of us are more spherical. Some are closer to a circle. Someone who\u2019s lean and mean is less of a circle.\u201d Thomas\u2019 paper included a graphic illustration worth the proverbial 1,000 words. It depicted three figures: a lean man who is 5-foot-8 and has a 27-inch waist; a muscular man who is 5-foot-6 with a 29-inch waist; and one with more fat than the others who is 5-foot-6 with a 36.6-inch waist. Each had a BMI of 27. Other researchers investigated the idea. A 2016 study that compared BMI with blood pressure and blood work, for example, found that the measure was a poor match for health status. Nearly half of people deemed overweight, as defined by having a BMI between 25 and 29.9, and nearly one-third of those said to be obese \u2014 a BMI of 30 or above \u2014 were actually in good metabolic health. Thirty percent of those with a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9, which is deemed a healthy weight, were actually in poor metabolic health. Ethnic variation is increasingly recognized as a wild card by medical experts. Asians and those with Asian ancestry, for example, have a pattern of central obesity that puts them at high risk for Type 2 diabetes, even at lower BMI scores. Several medical organizations have recommended considering these patients overweight at a BMI of 23 rather than 25, and obese at a BMI of 27 rather than 30. Physicians tend to agree that BMI is a crude measure that doesn\u2019t capture variations in body shape, composition, muscle mass and bone density. \u201cThere\u2019s extreme variation in the population in the degree of muscularity of people, even those of the same weight,\u201d said Dr. Steven Heymsfield, a professor of metabolism and body composition at Louisiana State University\u2019s Pennington Biomedical Research Center. \u201cThe percentage of fat can vary from 10% to 40% among people of the same BMI, age and sex,\u201d Heymsfield said. \u201cThe BRI is a way of capturing these variations.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "The benefits of owning a pet might be overstated, researchers have said after tracking more than 6,000 people for 12 months, the finding contradicting the popular assumption of improved mental health of those having a pet. In fact, the pet-owners reported slightly worse mental health outcomes compared to those who did not own one, the research team said. However, among a small group of the participants living alone, pet-owners were found to be less lonely than people having no pets. \"Although the body of research done on the topic has been mixed, we were genuinely surprised to find that pet owners generally experienced slightly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and anhedonia (loss of pleasure) during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" lead author Christine Parsons from Aarhus University, Denmark, said. \"This runs counter to a prevailing public belief that pets are beneficial for mental health,\" Parsons said. For the study, published in the journal Mental Health and Prevention, 6,018 people in the United Kingdom -- 54 per cent with pets and 46 per cent without -- responded to online questionnaires from April 2020 and were contacted at regular intervals for 12 months. \"Pet ownership was not associated with beneficial effects on any of the mental health outcomes at the first assessment or longitudinally,\" the authors wrote. \"Instead, associations were in the unexpected direction, with owners generally having slightly worse mental health symptoms and loneliness,\" they wrote. However, in people living alone specifically, the researchers found that pet owners were less lonely in comparison. The authors also examined another commonly held belief that dog owners, in particular, benefit from increased physical activity and a more structured daily routine. \tThese might, in turn, lead to improved mental health, it is believed. The team found that while dog owners really were more likely to engage in daily exercise -- 40 per cent among those owing a dog compared to 35 per cent in those not -- the increased activity did not correlate with better mental health outcomes. Further, no significant difference was found in the study between dog owners and non-owners with regards to maintaining a daily routine. The researchers also tested a popular culture caricature -- the 'cat lady', commonly seen to represent a middle-aged, lonely and anxious woman owning many cats and having mental health issues. While women in the study were clearly more likely to own cats -- 30 per cent compared to 22.7 per cent in men -- they were not more lonely, depressed, anxious or anhedonic than men who owned cats, the researchers said. \"Therefore, we find no evidence supporting the 'cat lady' stereotype, whereby women who own cats are viewed as being more lonely, depressed and anxious,\" they wrote.",

        "Article Content": "Lack of access to green spaces coupled with long-term exposure to air pollution increases the risk of hospitalisation for respiratory disorders, medical researchers have said in a study, adding fresh evidence for the gifts of greenery. Multiple studies in the past have established how air pollution increases the risk of respiratory disorders such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that can be compensated by access to tree-lined parks or gardens. But data on their impacts on hospitalisation has been scanty. The new study to be presented on Sunday at the European Research Society\u2019s conference in Vienna, Austria, has found a 30 to 45 per cent increased risk of hospitalisation with each interquartile range increase in pollutants such as soot and nitrogen dioxide. Proximity to greenery lowered the risk. \u201cAir pollution contributes to persistent inflammation and oxidative stress in the respiratory system,\u201d said Shanshan Xu, a researcher at the department of global public health and primary care, University of Bergen, Norway. \u201cThese harmful processes can lead to the development and exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases which can escalate into severe health episodes requiring hospital care.\u201d Xu and her team members tracked the health of 1,644 people from five countries, analysing their potential exposure between 1990 and 2000 to particulate matter, black carbon, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone as well as the level of green landscapes around their homes. Although greenery was associated with a decreased risk of respiratory hospitalisation, it also led to increased number of respiratory emergency room visits which the researchers have attributed to the co-presence of hay fever, an allergic condition. Their findings come alongside independent research by an international team of scientists indicating cities in low- and middle-income countries on average have just 70 per cent of the \u201ccooling capacity\u201d provided by the urban greenery in cities in high- income countries. The relatively lower greenery in low- and middle-income countries, environmental health researchers say, is a cause of worry not just for exacerbation of respiratory disorders but also for extreme heat. Amid rising global temperatures, a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect can make cities effectively hotter than rural areas, and lack of greenery can raise temperatures even within localities. \u201cOur analysis suggests that green spaces can cool the surface temperature in the average city by about 3\u00b0C during warm seasons \u2014 a vital difference during extreme heat,\u201d said Tim Lenton, the chair of climate change at the University Exeter in the UK who led the research on green spaces worldwide. A study led by researchers at the Barcelona Institute of Global Health four years ago had found that a rapid increase in built-up land use \u2014 meaning absence of greenery \u2014 within 300 metres of a person\u2019s residence was associated with an increase in risk for high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes.",

        "Article Content": "Public health experts on Monday called on policymakers to acknowledge the impacts of social risk factors driving India\u2019s unusually high rates of suicide and not treat attempts at self-harm as merely a mental health issue. While clinical treatment services through emergency helplines and medical intervention are critical for people in suicidal crisis, upstream measures that address social factors must also be included in national suicide prevention strategies to prevent people from reaching crisis point, the experts have said. Their call to broaden the scope of suicide prevention strategies comes amid long-standing concerns that suicide rates in India are higher than the global average. A 2018 study estimated over 2,30,000 suicide deaths in India during 2016, with India\u2019s contribution to global suicide deaths increasing from around 25 per cent in 1990 to 36 per cent in 2016. The study also suggested that suicide is the leading cause of death among the young with 71 per cent of suicide deaths among women and 58 per cent among men occurring in those aged between 15 and 39 years, amplifying concerns about possible factors underlying these patterns. An international panel of experts has now cautioned that tackling suicide from a broad public health perspective is \u201cnow more important than ever,\u201d citing what they have described as \u201cconsensus among economists\u201d that the world is entering into a new economic recession. \u201cWe need to think critically about the broad, pervasive social determinants of suicide and how these arise, are perpetuated, and can be countered,\u201d the five-member panel wrote in a paper in  , a medical journal. The Union health ministry had released a national suicide prevention strategy in 2022 which, the panel members said, is largely focussed on efforts to curb suicides through mental health interventions. \u201cThe strategy falls short of addressing primary stressors,\u201d said Rakhi Dandona, professor of public health at the Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi, a co-author of the new paper. \u201cMental health support is needed for those who may be suicidal because of mental health conditions, but it is not the solution for others who are suicidal because of debt or domestic violence or other factors,\u201d Dandona told  Dandona and her colleagues have in their paper expressed concern that suicide prevention has been viewed primarily as a mental health issue and proposed solutions have tried to address access to and quality of mental health services for people in suicide crisis. Anecdotal accounts from across the country point to people, including students and other young adults, taking their lives under stressful situations triggered by myriad factors \u2014 education, workplace and finance, among other issues relating to life conditions. \u201cWe need to broaden our narrative to include a public health approach that will  also include mental health,\u201d Dandona said.  A lab test has confirmed the presence of mpox in a young male patient in India and  revealed it to be clade 2, which is not part of the current public health emergency  declared by the World Health Organisation. The health ministry said on Monday that the patient is stable without any systemic illness and that this case is an isolated case similar to the 30 earlier cases in India since July 2022.",

        "Article Content": "Most people experience a panic attack at some point in their lives. It is usually triggered by an event that causes fear and tension, such as a death in the family, a thief entering the house, an accident, financial stress or the loss of a job. It may cause the heart to beat rapidly, with sweating or diarrhoea. It may also make us feel faint, especially when we think of the problem. Sometimes, these symptoms can also occur without a precipitating cause. Suddenly, a person feels that he or she cannot breathe. The heart beats rapidly, and he or she thinks he or she is going to die. This is an exaggerated flight-or-fight reaction, which occurs in response to a triggering event. When we are frightened or tense, the body releases the chemicals adrenaline and noradrenaline, which causes these flight-or-fight responses. Sometimes the release of adrenaline occurs for no reason; these attacks occur frequently and unexpectedly, affecting the person\u2019s life. They may be unable to leave the house, enter an elevator or sleep. If they lie down, they will wake up in a panic. If they are sleep-deprived, they may not be able to function or work effectively. The real reason for panic attacks is not known. They are commoner in women, leading to speculation that hormones play a role. The person may be genetically predisposed when parents, grandparents or other members of the family have similar attacks. The reason may be genetic or caused by significant continuing financial or emotional stress in the family that cannot be cured and will not go away. The cause is not clear. If you are prone to panic attacks, you must have specific investigations done. A hyperfunctioning thyroid can produce a rapid heartbeat, sweating and tremors, but it will be present all the time. If you are diabetic and your blood sugar suddenly dips, you may also have similar symptoms. You may also have a problem with your heart, where there is an uncontrolled, sudden, rapid beating of the heart due to abnormal signals or atrial fibrillation. Blood tests and ECGs can diagnose these conditions. You are lucky if there is a treatable cause for your panic attack. Treating thyroid problems, regulating the heartbeat with medication or a pacemaker, or controlling the blood sugar levels may then prevent the attacks. If the panic attack is because of a lifestyle situation or has no known precipitating cause, psychotherapy can be tried. This means consulting a counsellor or a psychiatrist so that you can talk about your fears and anxieties. Deep breathing helps. This technique involves breathing in for a count of 20, holding your breath for a count of 20 and breathing out for a count of 20. This regulates the heart rate and calms the mind. You can do this 20 times twice a day, morning and evening. Many people can sense a panic attack coming on, so you can do it at that time too and prevent an attack. Meditation and yoga are a great help. They control the brain chemicals that cause panic attacks and help regulate them. Regular exercise has a similar effect. It also regulates the heart rate, which helps to control and prevent panic attacks. If none of this works, you may need to be put on medication. Usually, a combination of antidepressants and antianxiety agents is tried. A low dose is started first and then gradually increased. Do not try to treat yourself with medication purchased over the counter. Remember that some of these \u2014 especially the group of compounds like diazepam and alprazolam \u2014 can be addictive, so eventually higher doses need to be taken to achieve the same effect. Anxiety and panic attacks are very treatable conditions. Remember, it takes time for the body to respond, so be patient. Exercise regularly and do yoga even if medication has been prescribed and live a healthy life.",

        "Article Content": "People who volunteered to receive a once-a-day oral candidate weight reduction pill lost up to 13 per cent of their body weight over three months, researchers have said, announcing the results of the first clinical trial on the new molecule. If it lives up to its early promise, the candidate drug called amycretin under development by the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk could emerge as an alternative to existing drugs that need to be taken via injections, doctors familiar with the research said. The first-in-human study conducted by a clinical research unit in the US has found that participants who received 50mg amycretin reduced their body weight by 10.4 per cent on average within 12 weeks of treatment. Another set of participants who received two 50mg pills achieved a body weight reduction of 13.1 per cent. Those who received placebo \u2014 sham pills \u2014 showed a 1.1 per cent weight loss. Amycretin is a single molecule that mimics the action of two peptide hormones \u2014 amylin and so-called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. Both of these play a key role in appetite regulation and the feeling of hunger and have been shown to lead to weight loss. Current GLP-1-based treatment options are primarily administered through injections, and a candidate molecule to deliver amylin-based treatment also through injections is under clinical development. At present there are no tablet-based treatment options for either of these biological substances. \u201cThe daily oral amycretin treatment in adult participants with overweight or obesity demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability and led to remarkable reductions in body weight reductions over only 12 weeks,\u201d Novo Nordisk researcher A Gasiorek and colleagues have said in their study. \u201cWhat makes this unique is that it is a single molecule that targets two biological pathways and it is an oral tablet,\u201d said Ambrish Mithal, chair and head of endocrinology at Max Healthcare hospital in New Delhi, who was not associated with the study. Mithal noted that the first study was on people who were overweight or obese and not on patients with diabetes. \u201cThe early results are encouraging and the oral option makes it potentially very attractive,\u201d he said.",

        "Article Content": "There is no rose without thorns, the old saying goes. But to botanists, there is no rose with thorns \u2014 the spiky outgrowths of a rose stem are called \u201cprickles\u201d and are biologically distinct from the stiff, woody thorns of other plants. Prickles are a remarkable example of evolution repeating itself. In the past 400 million years, plants evolved them 28 different times. Roses grow prickles on their stems, whereas others grow them on their leaves or their fruits. Grasses grow tiny prickles on their flowering tufts. Solanum atropurpureum, a wild relative of potatoes that grows in Brazil, has prickles so nasty that they\u2019ve earned it two fearsome nicknames: Purple devil and Malevolence. A new study published in   sheds some light. Over and over again, each species took advantage of a single gene. The discovery opens up the possibility of altering the DNA of plants to remove their prickles, making some wild plants easier to grow as crops. Zachary Lippman, a plant geneticist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, US, got curious about prickles as he studied a group of crops that includes potatoes, tomatoes and eggplants. While the crops are all prickle-free, some of their wild relatives are covered in the little daggers. Early farmers must have bred the prickles out of the wild plants as they started using them for crops. \u201cWho wants to cultivate eggplants that you can eat if there are these prickles poking you all the time?\u201d he asked. The loss of prickles led Lippman and his colleagues to wonder how the spikes had evolved in the first place. It\u2019s likely that prickles arose in many plants as a defence against animals that would devour them. But prickles can serve other purposes, too. Some plants use them to hook onto surfaces while climbing. Some wild grasses use them to hook their seeds onto the fur of passing animals. Charles Darwin recognised that the same trait can evolve many times over in the history of life \u2014 a process known as convergence. Bats and birds, for example, both evolved wings for flying. But they took different evolutionary paths to the same destination: bat wings evolved as membranes that grew between their fingers, whereas birds evolved wings made of feathers. To understand how plants converged on prickles, Lippman and his colleagues crossed one variety of domesticated eggplant with its wild, prickly relative. Some of the hybrids had lots of prickles, while others had none. Comparing the DNA of the plants, the scientists found that a specific variant of a gene called LOG was only carried by plants with prickles. Botanists had long known that LOG genes help produce a hormone that signals plant cells to grow. But in the wild eggplant, a special version of LOG allowed prickles to grow. Lippman ran the same experiment on two other kinds of eggplants, crossing them with their wild relatives. Each time, the researchers discovered a LOG variant was responsible for prickles in the wild plants. \u201cWe found that it was the same gene that had independently accumulated mutations in all three lineages to lose those prickles,\u201d Lippmann said. It might seem puzzling that mutating a LOG gene could take away prickles without harming the eggplant as a whole. After all, LOG genes are known to be essential for plants growing at all. It turns out that plants have evolved many copies of LOG genes over millions of years. Lippman and his colleagues speculated that one copy of the LOG gene evolved in the wild ancestors of eggplants to make prickles, while the other versions went on with their original job of helping the plants grow. He and his colleagues wondered if LOG genes were important to prickles in other plants as well. In dozens of species, they discovered evidence of the same link. Blocking a LOG gene in roses, for example, interfered with the development of prickles. \u201cWe can make these giant prickles turn into tiny little buds,\u201d Lippman said. The new findings could help scientists transform wild plants into domesticated crops, Lippman said. He and his colleagues tested this possibility on a wild Australian plant sometimes called the desert raisin. The sweet fruit is normally prickly. But after the researchers snipped the LOG gene from its DNA, it became free of prickles. Vivian Irish, an evolutionary biologist at Yale University, US, who was not involved in the new study, said it showed that convergence can happen in a way that Darwin didn\u2019t envision. Each time prickles arose, plants did not evolve an entirely new way to make them. They just borrowed the same gene again and again. \u201cInnovation in many cases might simply reflect reusing old genes in new ways,\u201d Irish said. NYTNS",

        "Article Content": "We\u2019ve all experienced it: the urge to withdraw and duck experiences we know we\u2019ll enjoy \u2014 even when a mood boost is what we need most. We skip the birthday party. We cancel lunch with friends. Attending these events just don\u2019t seem worth the effort. And then, more likely than not, we feel worse than we did before. So how do you find the motivation to get out there, especially when you\u2019re feeling low, stressed, tired or lonely? One proven strategy is to strengthen what psychologists call your reward sensitivity. Our drive to seek out happiness is a muscle that we can develop. So is our ability to relish experiences. And almost anyone can learn to amp up their reward sensitivity by training themselves to notice and savour their positive emotions. That\u2019s even true for people with depression and anxiety who struggle to experience pleasure, a condition called anhedonia. When it comes to mental health treatment, doctors and therapists tend to focus on easing their patients\u2019 negative symptoms \u2014 they want \u201cto take away the bad\u201d, explained Alicia Meuret, a professor of psychology at Southern Methodist University in the US. In fact, improving positive emotions can be a higher priority for patients than containing their depressive symptoms. And research shows that treatments based on this idea can be quite effective. A 2023 study co-led by Meuret found that when adults experiencing depression or anxiety participated in 15 weeks of psychotherapy focused on enhancing positive emotions, they reported more improvement than a group whose therapy focused on reducing negative emotions. Shorter interventions have shown benefits as well. A 2024 study of 85 students, led by Lucas LaFreniere, an assistant professor of psychology at Skidmore College, US, gave subjects with anxiety regular smartphone prompts to plan pleasurable activities, savour positive moments and look forward to future positive events. After a week, they showed significantly improved feelings of optimism. To raise your reward sensitivity, you can try an exercise based on the treatment plans in these studies. Make it a daily practice for as long as it\u2019s helpful, but commit to at least a week. Begin by planning one activity per day that will make you happy or give you a sense of accomplishment. This will make you less likely to postpone positive experiences. Be realistic \u2014 it can be as small as treating yourself to a favorite snack, reading a few pages of a novel or FaceTiming a friend. After you have enjoyed that daily moment, close your eyes and recount out loud, in the present tense, where and when you experienced the greatest joy. Home in on details and physical sensations, like the breeze cooling your face as the sun shines. This all might feel sappy, but don\u2019t gloss over the specifics, Meuret cautioned. The idea is not only to remember how you felt, but to amplify and re-experience it. Here are some more subtle but powerful tweaks you can make to nurture a positive mindset. \u201cSome people can feel vulnerable when they let themselves feel good,\u201d LaFreniere said. Worrying can make you feel like you\u2019re ready to respond to threats \u2014 but by constantly prepping for disaster, he said, we miss the happiness in front of us right now. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d LaFreniere said, \u201csometimes we need to behave like happy people if we actually want to be happy.\u201d NYTNS",

        "Article Content": "A recent research study has used machine learning (ML) to predict domestic violence or intimate partner violence (IPV). The model has been created by a team from the Centre for Social and Behaviour Change, Ashoka University, Sonipat, by employing various algorithms like random forest, which uses a very large dataset. Predicting such violence helps to identify those who are vulnerable to it and can, therefore, lead to better intervention or prevention strategies. \u201cSuch a model can be used by field health workers and social workers to identify women who are at higher risk of experiencing intimate partner violence,\u201d says Sneha Shashidhara, a cognitive neuroscientist and a senior research fellow at the Centre for Social and Behaviour Change, who worked on the project. This work was done under the guidance of the director of the centre, Pavan Mamidi, along with Shardul Vaidya and Ishank Daral, senior data researchers who worked with the centre. ML can analyse many factors at once and see how they interact. This is particularly helpful in analysing a psychosocial phenomenon like violence. No one social or environmental factor is in a simple, easy relationship with another, though they both may encourage a particular outcome, in this case, domestic violence. ML helps to bring this complexity out. The process does not need data to follow \u201cstrict rules\u201d, says Shashidhara, in the same way as traditional statistics. Factors such as socioeconomic status, past experiences of violence, addiction and social behaviour are found to be important in predicting domestic violence. Their peer-reviewed research paper, titled \u201cUsing Machine Learning Prediction to Create a 15-question IPV Measurement Tool\u201d, was published in the   in January. The research was based on data about 66,013 women in the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), 2015-16. The NFHS states that almost 30 per cent of Indian women aged 15-49 have experienced domestic violence in one year. However, much of such violence remains unreported. \u201cUsing the NFHS data, our model was trained to pick up patterns that led to predicting domestic violence with an accuracy of 78 per cent,\u201d says Shashidhara. The training sample was kept separate from the test sample.  The strongest predictors of the violence are the husband\u2019s alcohol use and a history of violence in the wife\u2019s family, where her mother also experienced domestic violence. Women who think it is acceptable for their partners to be violent in certain situations, such as \u201cneglect of children, being argumentative, making mistakes in cooking or leaving the house\u201d, are more likely to experience domestic violence.  The husband\u2019s controlling behaviour, manifest through checks on money, the wife\u2019s movements and limiting her friends, could be an indicator of violence. Poverty and lack of education can encourage an environment of violence. Rising temperatures were another factor that contributed to domestic violence.  Key questions relating to these factors come out as most significant in the analysis. The large model uses many questions, but the research also created a smaller model using 15 questions. For verification of the model, data from the test set, also from NFHS, were used and tested against the actual outcome. \u201cThat led to the 78 per cent match,\u201d says Shashidhara. The models, with the key questions, are ready for practical application. The smaller model with the 15 questions can be handy, says Shashidhara. The research team has also prepared an app. A discussion is on for adopting the model in frontline health work. Shashidhara raises a few ethical concerns about ML. Models could unfairly target men as high-risk. Monitoring of households considered vulnerable could be intrusive. Algorithm bias could falsely depict one demographic as either high-risk or low-risk.  Two other recent studies on domestic violence have used ML, Shashidhara points out. A study by Amusa et al. (2020) on 1,816 married women in South Africa found that fear of the husband was the strongest predictor of domestic violence. ML was used by McDougal et al. (2021) in a study on marital sexual violence in India.",

        "Article Content": "People who sleep late and wake up late have a higher body mass index, larger waists and are nearly 50 per cent more likely to develop diabetes than people who sleep early, researchers have said in a new study released on Sunday. While earlier studies linking sleep and diabetes have pointed to other lifestyle factors such as irregular or unhealthy eating coexisting with the late sleeping habit, the new findings indicate that the increased diabetes risk cannot be explained through lifestyle alone. \u201cWe believe that other mechanisms are also at play,\u201d Jeroen van der Velde, a health researcher at Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands and the study\u2019s lead author said in a media release. One possible explanation, he said, could be that the circadian rhythm or the body\u2019s biological clock in people who sleep late and wake up late is \u201cout of sync\u201d with work and social schedules in society. \u201cThis could lead to circadian misalignment, metabolic disturbances, and eventually to diabetes,\u201d he said. In their study, van der Velde and his colleagues analysed sleep timings, body fat distribution, and the prevalence of diabetes in over 5,000 people as part of a Dutch epidemiological study on obesity probing how body fat might influence disease. The researchers divided the study participants into three groups \u2014 early chronotypes, the 20 per cent who slept early and woke up early, late chronotypes, the 20 per cent who slept late and woke up late, and intermediate chronotypes, the remaining 60 per cent. They found that late chronotypes had a 46 per cent higher risk of developing diabetes compared to the intermediate chronotypes, even after the results were adjusted for age, sex, education, body fat, and key lifestyle factors such as diet quality, alcohol intake, smoking and sleep quality. The findings will be presented at a conference of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes that opens in Madrid, Spain, on Monday. The results suggest that lifestyle factors alone cannot explain the enhanced diabetes risk. Late chronotypes had on average a 0.7kg per metre squared higher body mass index, 1.9cm larger waist circumference, and 14 per cent higher liver fat content than intermediate chronotypes. The study, published on Sunday in the research journal  , is the second over the past year to point to a connection between sleep timings and diabetes risk that transcends lifestyle factors. The higher body fat, including more visceral fat and liver fat, may be contributing to the diabetes risk, van der Velde said. The researchers are currently involved in a study to determine whether reversing metabolic disturbances could lower the risk of  diabetes. Medical researchers at the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in the US had in an independent study last year reported that sleeping late and waking up late was associated with a 19 per cent increased diabetes risk, after accounting for other lifestyle factors. \u201cWhen we controlled for unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, the strong association between chronotype and diabetes risk was reduced but still remained, which means lifestyle explains a notable proportion of this association,\u201d said Sina Kianersi, a researcher at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in a media release. In the Netherlands, van der Velde and his colleagues are exploring whether eating early might help lower the diabetes risk. Night owls concerned about the increased risk might want to try eating early or refrain from eating late in the night, he said.",

        "Article Content": "At a Berlin trade fair for sustainability, a new gadget caught Waltraud Berg\u2019s eye \u2014 a solar panel small enough to be easily installed on the side of a balcony and plugged into a wall socket to feed energy into her home. \u201cI was thrilled to learn that you can generate your own power,\u201d said Berg, a retiree who installed several panels on the south-facing balcony of her Berlin apartment by herself. Each of the lightweight panels produces only enough electricity to charge a laptop or run a small refrigerator. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to drill or hammer anything,\u201d Berg said. \u201cYou just hang them from the balcony like wet laundry in Italy.\u201d More than 5,00,000 of the systems have already been set up across Germany, and new laws that relaxed rules around solar panel installation have contributed to a boom in use. In the first six months of the year, the country added 9 gigawatts of photovoltaic capacity, according to the Federal Network Agency, a German regulator. Said Klaus M\u00fcller, president of the agency, \u201cCompared to the total capacity at the end of 2023, almost 10 per cent more solar capacity was added. Of that, two-thirds was installed on buildings, which includes balcony systems.\u201d As part of its push to move away from dependence on Russian natural gas, the European Union is looking to quadruple the amount of power generated through photovoltaic sources by 2030, to 600 gigawatts. Germany aims to reach one-third of that amount by the same year. This year, Germany is expected to add more solar power capacity than any other European country, according to Rystad Energy. Some of the solar panels sold in Germany are made by European companies, but most are produced in China, whose dominance of the global industry allows it to deliver solar panels at increasingly lower costs, said Nicholas Lua, an analyst with Rystad Energy. In the early 2000s, Germany encouraged people to instal solar panels on the roofs of their homes by rewarding them with payments, known as feed-in tariffs, for sending energy to the grid. But those have become less lucrative in recent years, making such large-scale investments less attractive. The plug-in systems involve routing the direct current generated by the panels to an inverter, which converts it to an alternating current. They can then be plugged into a conventional wall socket to feed power to a home. Janik Nolden, who together with two friends founded Solago, a German start-up that sells rooftop solar panels and the plug-in versions, said most of his customers were interested in installing the panels on their own. Most of the panels he sells are produced in China, which makes better quality and less expensive panels than anything being produced in Europe. Prompted by questions from do-it-yourselfers, Nolden started posting videos online explaining how the panels work, as well as how to plan, instal and optimise them. \u201cDIY is the future,\u201d he said. The company, which opened in a small storefront in a suburb of Dusseldorf, Germany, has since grown to a fill a warehouse roughly the size of a New York City square block, with 50 employees helping ship eight trucks worth of deliveries. Elsewhere in Europe, plug-in solar panels are popular in the Netherlands, and interest is growing in France, Italy and Spain, in part driven by a steady drop in prices. In Germany, individual plug-in panels sell for as low as 200 euros (about   18,600). Complete sets, including mountings, an inverter and cables, are about twice that cost. Electricity prices in Germany jumped after Russia invaded Ukraine, and have now settled at around 25 euro cents per kilowatt-hour. But they remain among the highest in Europe. Adding to the appeal in Germany are recently passed laws that effectively prevent landlords and co-op boards from blocking solar panel installations and drop some of the cumbersome registration requirements. Together, these changes have made the idea of installing a personal solar system attractive to a wider consumer base. \u201cWe are seeing more diversity, more older people, more women,\u201d said Christian Ofenheusle, who founded and runs EmpowerSource, an enterprise that promotes small-scale solar use. A growing user group is young people with families who are concerned about climate change. \u201cThey say they want to make a contribution,\u201d he said. NYTNS",

        "Article Content": "It\u2019s dinner time. You\u2019ve worked hard to prepare a nutritious and tasty meal. But after taking your first bite you feel something is missing. Perhaps you should have added more salt? Pepper? Or maybe even something more exotic like monosodium glutamate, better known as MSG? \t There are many food additives used in both home cooking and commercial products. These ingredients improve the flavour, smell, texture, appearance and longevity of foods.  Salt and MSG are two well-known food additives. Both contain sodium, but there are plenty of differences which you can use to your benefit. \t Salts are made of positively and negatively charged components called ions. Salts generally dissolve in water, and are brittle. The names of salts often feature a metal (positively charged) followed by a non-metal (negatively charged).  The common kitchen ingredient we call \u201csalt\u201d is just one type of salt. To distinguish it from all other salts, we should more specifically refer to it as \u201ctable salt\u201d. Chemically, it\u2019s sodium chloride. \t After the quick chemistry lesson above, we can see that table salt, sodium chloride, contains a positively charged sodium and a negatively charged chlorine.  These charged components are arranged in crystals of salt in a regular repeating pattern. Each sodium ion is surrounded by six chloride ions and each chloride ion is surrounded by six sodium ions. This arrangement gives the crystal a \u201ccubic\u201d form. If you look closely at salt, you may see cube-shaped crystals.  Sodium chloride is very abundant. It is found dissolved in Earth\u2019s oceans. Mineral deposits of salt, known as halite or rock salt, formed from the evaporation and crystallisation of ancient seas.  Depending on the source, the salt may contain many other trace minerals that can even add colour to it, such as the pink-coloured Himalayan salt from Pakistan. Salt can also be fortified with sodium iodide as a public health measure.  Describing the taste of salt is quite difficult without using the word \u201csalty\u201d. It\u2019s a very common food additive, as it is so abundant and versatile. It is an essential ingredient for many traditional food preservation techniques for meats (pork and fish), vegetables (kimchi, sauerkraut and pickles), and dairy (cheese and butter).  Salt is considered a universal flavouring agent. It can mask bitter flavours and bring out sweet, sour and umami (savoury) ones.  Despite popular depictions of taste maps, there is no one place on the tongue where we taste salt. Other sodium salts can also give a \u201csalty\u201d taste, but the effect declines (and can even turn to bitter) with negatively charged components other than chloride. \t Monosodium glutamate is also a salt. The glutamate is the negatively charged form of glutamic acid, an amino acid that is found in nature as a building block of proteins.  MSG, and more generally glutamates, are found in a wide range of foods including tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, soy sauce, dried seaweeds, Worcestershire sauce and protein-rich foods. All of these foods impart umami flavours, which are described as savoury or meaty.  Commercial MSG is not extracted from the environment but produced by bacterial fermentation. Glucose is converted to glutamic acid, which is further processed by adding sodium hydroxide to form MSG (and water).  MSG is sold as crystals, but they have a long, prismatic shape rather than the cubic form of sodium chloride. It\u2019s worth tasting a few crystals of MSG directly to experience the native taste of umami. Despite decades of bad press and concern, MSG is considered safe to consume in the concentrations typically found in or added to foods.  Table salt and MSG both contain sodium, but at different percentages of the total weight: table salt has around 40 per cent sodium, versus just 14 per cent in MSG. You are also more likely to be routinely adding table salt to your food rather than MSG.  Eating too much sodium is well known to be unhealthy. Potassium-enriched substitutes have been suggested for a range of health benefits. \t The flavour of MSG can be elevated further by combining it with other food additives, known as sodium ribonucleotides.  Japanese and Korean cooks figured this secret out long before chemists, as boiling dried fish and seaweed produces foundation stocks (dashi) containing a mix of naturally sourced glutamates and ribonucleotides.  Ribonucleotides are classified as \u201cgenerally considered as safe\u201d by food standards authorities. Humans consume many grams of the natural equivalent in their diets.  What can be more problematic are the carbohydrates- and fat-rich foods that have their flavours enhanced, which can potentially lead us to eat excessive calories.  The combination of MSG and ribonucleotides produces a more-ish sensation. Next time you see a bag of potato chips or instant noodles, have a quick look to see if it contains both MSG (E621) and a ribonucleotide source (E627\u2013E635).  I personally keep a jar of MSG in my kitchen. A little goes a long way to elevate a soup, stew or sauce that isn\u2019t quite tasting the way you want it to, but without adding too much extra sodium.

        "Article Content": "China\u2019s top drug regulator has cleared a mpox vaccine developed by local drug firm Sinopharm for clinical trials, which could be the country\u2019s first experimental dose to battle the deadly disease.  The domestic vaccine candidate, created by the Shanghai Institute of Biological Products and administered by Sinopharm, is expected to play an important role in preventing and controlling mpox infections, the company said in a statement released on Monday afternoon.  There is currently no approved mpox vaccine in China. Globally, a few vaccines have been approved in the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan and Russia.  In China, a vaccine candidate typically goes through three phases of clinical trials before gaining market approval.  The process can take years, even decades. However, the National Medical Products Administration, China's top drug regulator, has launched a number of accelerated or streamlined channels to facilitate applications of novel drugs and vaccines or those in urgent need, state-run China  Daily reported on Tuesday.  According to the company, the new vaccine is a replication-deficient vaccine based on a strain called MVA.  The description is the same as Jynneos, the world's first mpox vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States in 2019.  The World Health Organisation said on August 14 that the mpox outbreak in Africa constituted a public health emergency of international concern \u2014 its highest form of alert.  Previously, in July 2022, the WHO declared a global emergency but then lifted it in May last year because of a sustained decline in international cases.  So far, more than 120 countries and regions across the world have reported more than 100,000 confirmed infections and 226 related deaths.  China reported its first imported case in September 2022 and the first domestic case in June last year.  By the end of July, the nation had reported 2,567 confirmed cases, according to the China Daily report. ",

        "Article Content": "There are many task managers on the App Store but Karo comes with a twist. Unlike most apps that are focused on personal tasks, Karo manages and sends tasks to any of your contacts. The brainchild of Mustafa Yusuf, Karo\u2019s interface can\u2019t get any simpler and reminds one of a chat app. Select a contact to begin a \u201cchat\u201d. Whatever you key in will generate a new task. If the other person also has the Karo app installed, they\u2019ll see the task in the app. However, Karo works also for those who don\u2019t have the app. If that\u2019s the case, Karo sends the task via iMessage, WhatsApp or any other messaging app you choose. You can use natural language to add tasks and then Karo automatically creates a task with a deadline (if you mention one). Further, you can @mention a particular person to assign a task to them. Users are also allowed to attach images, videos, voice notes or PDF documents. You can take advantage of Karo AI to break down larger tasks into smaller tasks. On the main page, tasks are sorted by contact and that helps you to find things easily. The app also comes with an activity tab where you can see updates about all tasks that involve you. Small organisations use dedicated solutions for task management, but, as   points out, in India, a lot of businesses don\u2019t have a proper system in place. They prefer to handle tasks in WhatsApp groups directly. Yusuf thinks Karo\u2019s integration with the platform and its ability to create groups within the app will appeal to WhatsApp users. The developer has said that his app is already being used by a dry fruit distributor in Mumbai to assign packaging and delivery tasks to their team. The app has a seven-day trial period on the iOS App Store but beyond that, it\u2019s Rs 2,999 per year or Rs 399 per month. There is also a lifetime launch offer.",

        "Article Content": "On September 9, Apple will launch its new series of iPhones, comprising iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. One feature that will be the foundation of all Apple devices from this moment on is Apple Intelligence or Apple\u2019s take on artificial intelligence.  Apple Intelligence is the big feature coming to iPhone software this year and it\u2019s expected to be a major selling point in how Apple convinces users to get a new iPhone because only the latest devices (and last year\u2019s iPhone Pro and 15 Pro Max) are said to be able to run the top AI features. Apple has grabbed the entire Apple ecosystem and sprinkled AI all over it, which is exactly what makes Apple Intelligence different. Apple intelligence is compatible with Mac, iPad and iPhone. The company has made it clear that it is less about artificial intelligence and more about personal intelligence. Apple wants to build something that is focused on understanding you personally as the user and tailoring experiences to you with personal context. Here are some of the things you can do with Apple Intelligence. Writing tools\n       You can grab an email or a piece of text and writing tools can make your text more friendly, more professional or more concise. You can also make a summary of that text, make key points, a table, a list\u2026 you can even proofread your text so there are no mistakes. AI-generated emoji\n       Genmoji takes emoji to a new level. Users can create an original Genmoji to express themselves. By simply typing a description, their Genmoji appears, along with additional options. Users can even create Genmoji of friends and family based on their photos. Just like emoji, Genmoji can be added inline to messages, or shared as a sticker or reaction in a Tapback. Now you can have an \u201cemoji\u201d of a T-Rex on a surfboard. What difference does Apple Intelligence bring? Say you ask the device to make a Genmoji of your best friend riding a motorcycle. Yes, you can choose someone from within your photo library.  Image Playground\n       It\u2019s a complex feature that delivers an easy-to-use experience to create fun, playful images in apps like Messages, Notes, Keynote, Pages and more. Using the Image Playground API, you can add the same experience to your app and enable your users to quickly create delightful images using context from within your app.  It is basically an image generator that can come up with images of whatever you want. There are different styles \u2014 animation, illustration and sketch. But it doesn\u2019t want to create realistic-looking images that can spread misinformation. Image Wand\n       Visit, say, Notes and write something. Suddenly you feel there needs to be a sketch of a tree. Image Wand can transform your rough sketch into a related image in the Notes app. Use your finger or Apple Pencil to draw a circle around your sketch, and Image Wand will analyse the content around it to produce a complementary visual. You can even circle an empty space, and Image Wand will use the surrounding context to create a picture. Changes to Siri\n       Siri is undergoing a massive change. With an all-new design, richer language understanding and the ability to type to Siri whenever it\u2019s convenient for you, communicating with Siri is more natural than ever. Equipped with awareness of your personal context, the ability to take action in and across apps, and product knowledge about your devices\u2019 features and settings, Siri will be able to assist you like never before. With a double tap on the bottom of your iPhone or iPad screen, you can type to Siri from anywhere in the system when you don\u2019t want to speak out loud. Siri now has a richer language understanding and an enhanced voice makes communicating with Siri even more natural. And when you refer to something you mentioned in a previous request, like the location of a calendar event you just created, and ask \u201cWhat will the weather be like there?\u201d Siri knows what you\u2019re talking about. Apple Intelligence gives Siri with onscreen awareness, so it can understand and take action with things on your screen. If a friend texts you their new address, you can say \u201cAdd this address to their contact card\u201d, and Siri will take care of it. ChatGPT integration\n       OpenAI is Apple\u2019s first official partner. With ChatGPT from OpenAI integrated into Siri and Writing Tools, you get even more expertise when it might be helpful for you. Siri can tap into ChatGPT for certain requests, including questions about photos or documents. And with Compose in Writing Tools, you can create and illustrate original content from scratch. You control when ChatGPT is used and will be asked before any of your information is shared. Anyone can access ChatGPT for free, without creating an account. ChatGPT subscribers can connect accounts to access paid features within these experiences. Personal context\n       It is not exactly a feature but a pillar of Apple Intelligence. It grabs (on device) information from the calendar to photos when you ask Siri for something. For example, you have forgotten when your spouse\u2019s plane lands in Calcutta: Ask Siri and it will find information from screenshots and Messages. Or if you don\u2019t remember where the concert ticket is saved on the phone, ask Siri.",

        "Article Content": "Shortly before Steve Jobs\u2019 death in 2011, Apple filled a cramped auditorium in Cupertino, California, for the unveiling of its fifth iPhone. The device\u2019s biggest selling point was a new software feature called Siri, which helped cause a jump in iPhone sales. On Monday, Apple is planning to run that play again. For the first time in more than a decade, the tech giant will unveil a suite of iPhones whose signature feature won\u2019t be an improved camera or an updated design, but new software capabilities. The system, called Apple Intelligence, will sort messages, offer writing suggestions and create a more capable Siri powered by generative artificial intelligence. The new iPhones represent a big moment for generative AI, which can answer questions, create images and write software code. As a latecomer to the AI party, Apple is in a position to take the technology mainstream \u2014 or sow fresh doubt about its viability if it doesn\u2019t live up to expectations. Early enthusiasm for AI has been tempered by questions about its utility. This spring, Microsoft postponed features in an AI computer because of security vulnerabilities around the technology\u2019s recording of every second of activity. Humane, a startup that raised $240 million for a device called the Ai Pin, was panned by tech reviewers because its system was slow to fulfill requests and sometimes fielded them inaccurately. In the wake of those problems, Wall Street is looking to Apple for reassurance that customers want AI. The tech giant spent two years watching as Microsoft, Meta, Google and Samsung added AI to products. Apple has shown over the years that it can enter a market late and redefine it, as it did with digital music players, smartphones and smartwatches. Apple is hoping that AI can rejuvenate the iPhone. It considers the opportunity in AI so important that it canceled one of its big bets \u2014 a $10 billion project to develop a self-driving car \u2014 and reassigned hundreds of engineers to work on the technology. People are holding on to their iPhones longer as compelling new features have dwindled. The time between replacing an iPhone has expanded to nearly five years, up from three years in 2018, according to TD Securities, an investment bank. The slowdown in buying new phones has weighed on Apple\u2019s business, which relies on the iPhone for more than half of total sales. In addition to Apple Intelligence, which will be available on the iPhone Pro and Pro Max, analysts say, the new iPhones will feature a new button for taking photos, a slightly larger screen and faster processors. Wall Street analysts predict the features could help Apple sell a record 240 million iPhones next year, a 12% increase from this year. Similarly optimistic forecasts tied to AI have backfired for other technology companies. In recent months, shares of Nvidia, Microsoft and Google have been dragged down by weaker-than-expected sales of AI products. The declines weighed on the rest of the stock market because artificial intelligence has become a major focus of investors. For Apple, which introduced its first iPhone 17 years ago, it\u2019s unclear whether new features even matter. Nearly three-quarters of users say they buy a new iPhone because their current phone has become obsolete or been lost or damaged, according to a survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a technology research firm. Only a fifth say they buy a new phone to get the latest features. \u201cPushing out really cool new features used to drive a huge amount of replacements, but that isn\u2019t doing it any more,\u201d said Josh Lowitz, a partner at Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. \u201cIt\u2019s become like replacing your clothes dryer or your running shoes. You replace them when they\u2019re worn out.\u201d Apple has tried to distinguish its AI offering by emphasizing its ability to handle personal requests more privately. When it unveiled the technology in June, it said most requests would be fielded on the iPhone itself, where there\u2019s a lower risk that personal information could be compromised. Other requests would be routed to a cloud computing network with Apple semiconductors that the company said wouldn\u2019t store any information. If a user asks Siri when her mother\u2019s flight is arriving, Apple says, its AI system can provide a real-time estimate by pulling the flight information from an email and checking it against current flight tracking data. The company will complement those AI services with answers from ChatGPT. It struck a deal with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, to fulfill impersonal user requests, like what to cook with select ingredients. (  The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to AI systems.) Apple hasn\u2019t said when its array of AI features will be available for the new iPhones. It also hasn\u2019t explained how it will launch the technology overseas, particularly in China, its second-most important market. It is expected to address both Monday. Because AI systems could process personal information, governments have been pushing to have their citizens\u2019 data stored inside their borders. China previously mandated that with its citizens\u2019 iCloud data, requiring that Apple cede legal ownership over the data to a state-owned company. It is not known whether it would do the same with an Apple cloud network for AI. \u201cThis is a real challenge,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies, a tech research firm. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need to be culturally or regionally customized because every country is going to have to be handled very differently. There\u2019s a lot of uncharted territory here.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "The iPhone has grown predictable. Over the past seven years, it has generally looked the same, with incremental improvements to its cameras, processors and battery life. But on Monday, Apple tried to turn the page on that predictability by introducing its first artificially intelligent iPhone. The iPhone 16, which was unveiled in a prerecorded video at the company\u2019s futuristic Silicon Valley campus, comes in four models that are designed to run the company\u2019s generative artificial intelligence system, called Apple Intelligence. The company said that the phones will be able to sort messages, offer writing suggestions and use a more capable Siri virtual assistant. In addition to announcing those changes to the iPhone, the company unveiled the Apple Watch Series 10, which has rounder corners and a larger, brighter display that is nearly 10% thinner. They also introduced a new AirPods Pro, capable of automatically reducing noise at concerts or near construction sites, and acting as professional grade hearing aids. The iPhone 16 is debuting with fewer capabilities than the company marketed in June, when it announced its Apple Intelligence system. Starting next month, the phones will summarize notifications, offer writing recommendations and allow people to more quickly find photos. The AI also makes it possible to use the camera to identify specific types of flowers, plants or dog breeds. Other capabilities will arrive over time, the company said, including Siri\u2019s ability to field some requests related to personal information on the phone. Requests unrelated to personal information will be routed to ChatGPT. Apple released four versions of the iPhone 16, all of which come with a new camera button. The entry level models, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, start at $799 and feature a faster processor, a more powerful camera and an \u201cAction button\u201d that can be programmed to automatically retrieve capabilities such as the phone\u2019s flashlight. The higher-end models, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, start at $999 and feature a slightly larger display, a larger battery and the ability to capture studio-quality audio. They are available in stores Sept. 20.",

        "Article Content": "The annual tech extravaganza is on in Berlin. IFA showcases some of the coolest technology and it has been a great edition so far. Here are some of our favourites. Climbing robot cleaner\n       The future of the robot vacuum cleaner has been put forward by Roborock. On the Roborock Qrevo Curv and Qrevo Edge, the company is introducing the AdaptiLift Chassis or an independently adjustable three-wheel control to allow these models to dynamically adjust up to 10mm in height. The technology improves the ability to clean various floor types in different home environments to include mid-to-long pile carpets and navigating thresholds up to four cm high. Belkin chargers and sound solutions\n       Belkin is known to produce some of the best accessories and among the favourites at IFA are two new Qi2-certified BoostCharge Pro magnetic wireless travel chargers. There is a $119 two-in-one model that features a 15-watt Qi2 magnetic charging pad and a flip-up Apple Watch puck, while the $129.99 version adds a 5W nonmagnetic Qi charging pad for devices such as AirPods. The company also showcased its SoundForm line of budget wireless headphones, adding two new closed-back, over-ear models and two sets of earbuds. Monochrome buddy\n       TCL has two new midrange Nxtpaper phones with matte displays. The TCL 50 Pro Nxtpaper 5G and 50 Nxtpaper 5G come with an important feature: a button that puts the display into \u201cMax Ink Mode\u201d. The \u201cNxtpaper key\u201d is a two-stage slider that slips the display into monochrome mode mimicking e-ink. Turning on the mode silences notifications and renders app icons in a wireframe style, besides extending battery life. Another handheld console\n       Acer Nitro Blaze 7 is the latest in the handheld console arena. The Windows handheld looks like the Asus ROG Ally X and comes with a seven-inch, 1080p, IPS screen that goes up to a 144-Hz refresh rate, 16 GB of LPDDR5x SDRAM, up to 2 terabytes of storage, and the Ryzen 7 8840HS processor with AMD Radeon 780M integrated graphics. Modular phone\n       HMD is going strong and this time it\u2019s time for HMD Fusion. It supports open-source Smart Outfits that add to the phone\u2019s features. For example, the technology allows you to add a ring light for better selfies, enclose the phone in a more rugged shell for protection, or attach a controller to enhance your mobile gaming. All this is a reminder of Motorola Moto Mods. The Fusion is built around what HMD refers to as a \u201cslim, inner chassis\u201d. Users can replace the screen and the battery, just like the Skyline. Twisty laptop\n       Lenovo\u2019s latest concept laptop is Auto Twist AI PC, which looks like a traditional clamshell when closed. A voice command awakes the computer, its lid raises automatically and rotates into practically any position \u2014 even all the way around into tablet mode. Further, when the laptop detects it\u2019s not being used, it closes the lid to prevent unwanted users from gaining access. All that\u2019s fine but what\u2019s the use case, beyond point-of-sale payment terminals? Wireless power transfer\n       Wireless charging for smartphones is already there. What about the kitchen? The Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) is trying to eliminate wire mess on countertops with a new wireless power transfer protocol known as Ki. WPC demonstrated Ki\u2019s electromagnetic induction abilities in the form of a custom-installed marble countertop. Ear monitoring\n       Bebird EarVision Complete and EarVision Pro are like flexible Q-tips with a camera at the end. They\u2019re connected devices that go into ears to monitor what\u2019s going on. And when taking out gunk, these devices offer visual guidance, however gross it may sound. The EarVision Complete comes with accessories to scoop or pluck various ear junk, and the EarVision Pro features a more advanced gyroscope. Turn the beat around\n       Technics SC-CX700 is an active wireless speaker system designed to offer a zero-hassle setup that serves all your audio needs, offering up HDMI, phono inputs, and hi-res streaming in a neat, manageable package.",

        "Article Content": "Is there anything new to say about buttons? The buttoned-up shirt is a traditional symbol of the working day. Once the top two buttons are undone, it\u2019s Saturday night look for many. Ask Jony Ive for his take on the subject. Yes, he is the man synonymous with several Apple products. When he left Apple in 2019, he formed a design company named LoveFrom and his latest work involves fashion. Later this month, he will showcase his first collection of outerwear, in partnership with Remo Ruffini and Moncler. And he has become fixated with buttons. The man has come up with the magnetic Duo button that allows for fastening with one satisfying click. MagSafe charger on the MacBook anyone?! The luxury Italian outdoor brand is best known for black-and-white puffer jackets. The LoveFrom, Moncler collection revolves around a base-layer vest, which is down-filled and comes in yellow or off-white. How does the button work? The \u201cduo button\u201d is made up of two metal pieces that connect magnetically when in close proximity to each other. Five duo buttons appear on each layer, all in the same place. Simply pulling the top layer over the vest attaches the two parts of the garment. The buttons offer Ive\u2019s \u201cfiddle factor\u201d, \u201ca tactile attraction that makes people want to touch and fiddle\u201d with the man\u2019s designs. The fiddle factor has been a part of many of his designs at Apple. The first iMac came with a handle, which made people want to move it from one place to another.",

        "Article Content": "Apple needed a blockbuster move to keep the star of its portfolio \u2014 the iPhone \u2014 shining. The Cupertino headquartered company has unveiled the iPhone 16 series, which is expected to set off a spurt of growth by offering Apple Intelligence or a unique take on artificial intelligence. The Tim Cook-led company has also introduced sleep apnea detection feature on the new Watch Series 10. Apple said AirPods Pro 2 now has a \u201cclinical-grade\u201d hearing aid feature. \u201cThe next generation of iPhone has been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up,\u201d said Apple CEO Tim Cook. While most AI companies focus on either hardware (like semiconductors) or software (large language models), Apple is focusing on the combination of the two to leapfrog competitors with the ability to deliver AI capabilities, keeping personal context in mind, be it in interactions with the digital assistant Siri or summarising and improving messages and mails. For a company with an installed base of over 2.2 billion active devices (across categories), the upgrade cycle is significant, making the four new iPhones \u2014 two of which are Pro models \u2014 appealing, more so for its release schedule, arriving before the big festive season in India and in the US. Apple Intelligence will come to the entire new iPhone line-up (besides the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max). In a changing tech landscape, Apple Intelligence will help the company mature, tailoring services to local regulations. A significant upgrade on the new iPhone\u2019s hardware front involves the introduction of Camera Control. The touch-sensitive button will work like a shutter button on a DSLR camera, allowing users to adjust camera settings without touching the screen. Tapping it opens the camera, and also takes a photo or quick video with another tap or tap-and-hold, while a light press gives you a UI-free preview, and swiping side to side adjusts your zoom level. The company\u2019s ambitions for the Apple Watch continue unabated. The latest Watch Series 10 is capable of identifying whether someone shows signs of sleep apnea, a chronic disorder that causes periodic disruptions in night-time breathing. The National Institutes of Health in the US estimates that at least 50 million Americans struggle with some kind of sleep disorder, including sleep apnea. Further, scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found that people with obstructive sleep apnea have a significantly higher risk of depression. If the watch determines that the user may have sleep apnea, it will recommend that the user consult a medical provider for more tests.  Apple has also announced health-related features coming as a software update for AirPods 2. This includes a hearing protection mode being enabled by default, offering passive noise cancellation in loud environments. Apple is also launching a \u201cclinical grade\u201d hearing aid mode. Users can take a hearing test that can be viewed securely in the Health app. If hearing loss is detected, the hearing aid mode is then available to use. \u201ciPhone 16 with ground up design from silicon to software to services, brings a significant point for Apple to kickstart the AI journey optimised for Apple Intelligence. Since iPhone users use (the phone) for three to four years, we estimate this is a significant upgrade for someone looking to upgrade from iPhone 11/12. Since the iPhone 16 series will be manufactured in India, it will alleviate some pricing concerns for acquiring more premium models and should drive iPhone 16 sales to achieve highest ever sales in India growing at least 20 per cent annually for the next calendar year. Further better financing schemes and move to premiumisation aligns with Apple\u2019s push for the latest generation iPhones,\u201d Neil Shah, partner, Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research, told The Telegraph.

Despite having an open-ear design, it includes support for personalised spatial audio. But what everyone is talking about are the health features of the AirPods Pro 2. It will come as a software update. Hearing Protection is a unique feature that is turned on by default across listening modes. It appears that 80 per cent of US adults have not had their hearing checked in the past five years. The company is bringing a clinically validated hearing test with AirPods Pro 2 and iPhone that takes just five minutes to complete. After users take the hearing test, AirPods Pro 2 can turn into a personalised hearing aid, Apple said. The resulting \u201chearing profile\u201d will be automatically applied to music, movies and phone calls across all of a user\u2019s devices. The company has said the features will receive clearance from the FDA and other regulators soon. The popularity of AirPods could mean more people get hearing assistance earlier. If you consider this in terms of over-the-counter hearing aids, these are ideally best for those with mild to moderate hearing loss. Apple says users whose hearing tests indicate severe hearing loss will get a recommendation to see a professional. The company will offer a passive hearing protection mode that will automatically reduce noise in loud environments like concerts. The feature is always enabled, with Apple noting that one in three people are regularly exposed to noisy environments that could damage their hearing. Dive into AirPods 4 It took a few years but AirPods 4 is coming. The earbuds will be available in two versions: an entry-level model, known as the AirPods 4, and a higher-end model with noise cancellation, known as the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). The higher-end version includes Transparency Mode to help users hear their environment while walking around, along with Adaptive Audio to reduce some environmental noise. Both models will come with previously Pro-only force sensor that lets you squeeze the stem to play / pause media and more. The new AirPods case is 10 per cent smaller and has USB-C charging. The new design is built with an unparalleled data set that uses advanced modelling tools, like 3D photogrammetry and laser topography, to precisely map and analyse thousands of ear shapes and over 50 million individual data points in total. This process helped refine the design to deliver the most comfortable AirPods ever with one shape that naturally fits even more users around the world. AirPods Max with USB-C A new version of AirPods Max has been announced and it marks a switch from Apple\u2019s proprietary Lightning port to USB-C. Apple introduced a USB-C charging case for the AirPods Pro 2 last year but AirPods Max users are going to have to completely replace their headphones to get USB-C. How much? Customers can now pre-order AirPods 4 for  12,900 with availability beginning September 20. And AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation will come for  17,900. In case you are looking for AirPods Max with USB-C charging, it comes for  59,900.",

        "Article Content": "Apple\u2019s health goals have found a new way of expressing itself \u2014 the Apple Watch will alert wearers about \u201cmoderate to severe signs of sleep apnea\u201d and will offer a report that can be shared with the doctor to make discussions around the subject a little bit easier. The new feature is coming to the just-announced Apple Watch Series 10, besides Series 9 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2. The company said it expects FDA clearance for the feature later this month. Sleep apnea is something that affects millions across the globe. Many go to bed and drift into sleep that is not peaceful \u2014 people snore and gasp for air, causing chronic sleepiness and increasing the risk of heart disease, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. Sleep apnea affected an estimated 22 million Americans in 2019. Apple says it\u2019s using the accelerometer on its watches to monitor a new metric that it calls \u201cbreathing disturbances\u201d. Apple Watch users will be able to see their nightly breathing disturbance values in the Health app. The feature can be a game-changer for people who have sleep problems but have never received a formal diagnosis. Knowing that your sleep issues could be a symptom of an underlying disorder can be life-changing. The company said 80 per cent of people with sleep apnea are undiagnosed. This feature was built using an extensive dataset, Apple said. Every 30 days, the watch analyses data for signs of possible moderate to severe cases of sleep apnea. If it spots them, the wearer gets a notification and a detailed report. Besides the new health feature, the Series 10 can also sense water temperature and depth when submerged. A new Tides app will also show rising and falling tide data for coastlines.  You could be wondering if the watch has any design updates. The larger 46mm case option has a display slightly larger than the one on the Apple Watch Ultra 2. And new OLED tech translates into a screen that is easier to glance at from an angle. The larger size fits an additional line of text for messages, and Apple says typing on the still-tiny screen will be easier too. The new Watch is slightly thinner \u2014 9.7mm in the Series 10 versus 10.7mm in the Series 9 but on a device this small, even a small change makes a big difference. That\u2019s not all, you can now play podcasts or music directly through the watch\u2019s tiny speaker. Apple says the new display is 40 per cent brighter and that its always-on mode will now refresh once every second, up from once every minute on older devices. And did we mention there is a more efficient charging coil, making Series 10 the fastest-charging Apple Watch ever. Fifteen minutes of charging provides up to eight hours of normal daily use, or eight minutes of charging powers up to eight hours of sleep tracking. Faster charging also means users can charge to 80 per cent battery in about 30 minutes. Updates for Apple Watch Ultra 2\n       A new Titanium Milanese Loop band for Apple Watch Ultra is designed for water activities while offering lightweight comfort and elegance for any occasion. An all-new Apple Watch Hermes Ultra 2 combines the durability and features of Apple Watch Ultra 2 with a nautically inspired watch band and an exclusive Hermes watch face. The new black titanium finish for Apple Watch Ultra 2 is achieved with a custom blasting process, and the diamond-like carbon physical vapour deposition coating over the grade 5 titanium makes it scratch-resistant and durable. To complement the new black finish, the popular Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band have all been updated to offer a black hardware option in addition to natural titanium. Apple Watch Series 10 starts at  46,900 and Apple Watch SE is available starting at  24,900. You can pre-order now, with availability in stores beginning September 20.",

        "Article Content": "Japanese auto major Honda on Wednesday said it has started joint research on AI technologies with IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay with plans to develop driver assistance and automated driving technologies applicable in various regions of the world, including India.  The joint research is aimed to further advance Honda CI (Cooperative Intelligence)-- the original Honda AI that enables mutual understanding between machines and people, the company said in a statement.  Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL), a Honda subsidiary in India, will sign a joint research contract with the two IITs.  \"The IITs are a home to a large number of excellent researchers and engineers, and through the joint research with those institutes, Honda will strive to advance the underlying technologies of CI, with an eye toward the future applications for technologies that reduce traffic collisions and enable automated driving,\" it said.  With an aim to achieve further advancement of CI, Honda and IITs have set joint research themes such as recognition of the surrounding environment and cultivation of cooperative behaviour, and will conduct research and development while utilising the cutting-edge AI technologies, it added.  Under the partnership, for each research theme, Honda associates and IIT professors will engage with IIT students for planning, designing, developing and testing technologies which work beyond the confines of the laboratory and thereby proceed with the research and development more flexibly and with a high degree of freedom, Honda said.  \"This will enable Honda and IITs to work in a more flexible environment with deeper exchange of academic and industry insights,\" it added.  In addition, as part of this research, Honda with the help of IITs is aiming to conduct verification of driving assistance and automated driving technologies in the suburbs of Delhi and in Mumbai.  Due to numerous variations in the road systems and a large number of road users, India has a complex traffic environment where situations that occur frequently are difficult for AI to predict.  \"By conducting technology verification in such a technically challenging environment, Honda and IITs will refine the underlying technologies of CI and strive to apply them to future driver assistance and automated driving technologies in various regions of the world, including India,\" the statement said.  Honda said it has been actively hiring IIT graduates since 2019, and many of them are now playing key roles in the areas of mobility intelligence, including the research and development of CI.",

        "Article Content": "Indian scientists have developed a thin molecular film that they say can store 16,500 memory states and perform computations, representing a big advance over binary data storage and processing limited to two states that run traditional transistor-based computers. The researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, say their molecular film could help slash by hundreds of times the energy and time required to perform certain mathematical operations that play a key role in modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems. They have designed and tested in their lab the film \u2014 a molecular structure crafted out of metals and organic compounds \u2014 that can store and process data in 16,500 states, in contrast to the \u201czero\u201d or \u201cone\u201d state in binary systems and 64 states, the maximum achieved thus far. \u201cWe\u2019ve combined complex physics and chemistry into what we believe could be a groundbreaking technology for the next generation of AI hardware,\u201d said Navakanta Bhat, an expert in silicon systems at the IISc\u2019s Centre for Nanoscience and Engineering. Bhat and his colleagues at the IISc believe the technology, if successfully advanced into hardware systems, could potentially bring complex AI tasks, such as the training of large language models, to personal devices such as laptops and smartphones. A paper describing their feat appeared in the journal  on Wednesday. Lack of optimal hardware and associated energy inefficiency are key challenges that currently keep such complex artificial intelligence tasks confined to resource-heavy data centres which are accessible primarily to developers in large corporations, Bhat said.",

        "Article Content": "People often ask why I use the iPhone to shoot pictures and videos. The answer is simple: Who wants to miss an interesting shot? In the bagful of features highlighted during the September 9 keynote is the announcement that Apple is bringing 4K frames per second slow motion video recording and spatial audio to the iPhone 16 Pro. My interest lies in the more cinematic capabilities to the iPhone 16 Pro with slow-motion effects. Apple's Pro model iPhones have always pushed photographic prowess. The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max come with a new 48MP Fusion camera with a quad-pixel sensor and 4K120 fps video recording in Dolby Vision and HDR. The company says this is the \"highest resolution and frame-rate combination ever available on iPhone, and a smartphone first\u201d. That quad-pixel sensor can read data 2x faster, allowing zero shutter lag for 48MP ProRAW or HEIF photos. The new 48MP Ultra Wide camera also features a quad-pixel sensor with autofocus and the iPhone 16 Pro benefits from the new Camera Control button. Where the Pro model shines is that users can shoot 4K 120fps video in HDR at either full speed or in slow motion. That\u2019s not all: iPhone 16 Pro's higher frame rate capabilities will let you adjust the video speed after you've recorded a video in the Photos app. Remember, how we can adjust the focal point of a still shot after taking a picture? You can play videos back at 120fps, 60fps, 30fps or 24fps and you can mix and match footage for on-the-go editing. Making all the new tech possible is the iPhone 16 Pro's A18 Pro chip that has an image signal processor (ISP), allowing content makers to do frame-by-frame cinema-quality colour grading for 4K120 fps in Dolby Vision.  What good is a video if it doesn\u2019t have excellent audio? Both iPhone 16 Pro models come with four new studio-quality mics that preserve true-to-life recorded sounds, and video can now be captured in Spatial Audio for immersive listening with AirPods, Apple Vision Pro, or a surround sound system. It\u2019s time to edit video sound with Audio Mix which allows users to adjust their sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like the video was recorded inside a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in the front and environmental noises in surround sound. With wind noise reduction, powerful machine learning algorithms reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality. These are not small updates, especially when you look at camera features that are already there, namely Cinematic Mode introduced on the iPhone 13 Pro. Staying on with the visual game, there are next-generation Photographic Styles to allow users to express their creativity and customise photos by locally adjusting colour, highlights, and shadows in real-time. Styles also have a deeper understanding of skin undertones, so users can personalise how they appear in photos. Unlike filters, which often use a one-size-fits-all approach by adding a colour to an entire scene, adjustments are applied to specific colours of a selected style. Styles can be personalised with an easy-to-use new control pad and intensity slider for simultaneous adjustments across tone and colour. These adjustments can be rendered during live preview, applied after a photo is taken, or even reversed later.",

        "Article Content": "If we go beyond Apple Intelligence, one of the biggest new features on the iPhone is the Camera Control button, which can be a dream addition for anybody who likes photography. It\u2019s a small button nestled into the lower right side of the iPhone 16\u2026 all four versions of the phone. On holding the device in landscape mode, it lines up conveniently with your right index finger, like the shutter on a camera. It works in portrait mode too. It\u2019s a hardware and software integration that elevates the camera experience on the iPhone 16 lineup. What can this button do? Yes, it\u2019s quite obvious that a click on the button will bring up the Camera app. Last year, Apple allowed the Action Button on the iPhone 15 Pro (it has now been added to all the phones in the new series) to open the Camera app but many want to keep this button for silencing the phone. So, the Camera Control button is a welcome move. Another obvious detail but it\u2019s best to mention the fact. Once the Camera app has loaded, click the Camera Control button again to click a photo. Instead of a light press, go for a proper click to take a photo. In case you are in video mode, clicking the button will start recording. Or long press in photo mode to start recording video instantly. What happens if you lightly press the button when in the viewfinder? A zoom dial is visible next to your finger. Swipe left and right on the control to zoom in or out. Go for a double light tap and a swipe-driven menu of various camera controls show up. You can access zoom, depth effects, exposure, and other options by swiping along the button. And that\u2019s another interesting feature that was announced during the keynote. Point your iPhone at an object (say a cat) or place (like a restaurant), click and hold Camera Control. Voila, an AI-powered analysis pops up. If it\u2019s a cat, get to know the breed (we are sure Taylor Swift will love this), if it\u2019s a restaurant, you will be informed of the business hours. The feature will come to Camera Control later this year. The button will also get a two-stage shutter function that will allow you to lock focus and exposure. Camera Control includes a tactile switch that powers the click experience, a high-precision force sensor that enables the light press gesture, and a capacitive sensor that allows for touch interactions. Developers will be able to bring Camera Control to third-party apps such as Snapchat. It took us a minute to get things right, that is, determining how hard to press. It was seamless to switch between the various photo styles with swipes. The idea is to replicate the experience of using the shutter button on a digital single-lens reflex camera or DSLR. It works best with the phone held in your right hand, using your thumb on the button. It\u2019s also possible to do it with your left hand.",

        "Article Content": "A long-lasting mega El Nino condition marked by unusually elevated equatorial ocean temperatures may have triggered the worst mass extinction in Earth\u2019s history, the Permian-Triassic killing that wiped out 90 per cent of the planet\u2019s species 252 million years ago. New research by an international team of scientists has suggested that a mega El Nino turned the planet into a hothouse, setting off a cascade of events with devastating impacts on life forms in the sea and on land. Their study will appear in the US journal   on Friday. Earlier studies have proposed global volcanic eruptions, intense ultraviolet B radiation after a global depletion of ozone, acid rain, and changes in ocean conditions among factors underlying the extinction. But none of these factors alone can fully explain the patterns and timings of the extinction. What caused life on land, including plants and usually resilient insects to suffer just as badly as marine organisms has remained a big mystery. \u201cClimate warming alone cannot drive such devastating extinctions because, as we are seeing today, when the tropics get too hot, species migrated to cooler, higher latitudes,\u201d said Alexander Farnsworth, a scientist at the University of Bristol and the study\u2019s lead co-author said in a media release. The study, led by researchers at the University of Bristol and the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan and collaborators in academic institutions in other countries, involved computer simulations to determine what specific triggers might have contributed to the extinction. The researchers also studied oxygen isotopes of fossilised tooth material of tiny extinct swimming organisms called conodonts. The oxygen isotopes serve as signatures of temperatures. The scientists found a remarkable collapse in temperature differences in the low and middle latitudes. Geological studies, including patterns of extreme dryness observed in 252-million-year-old rocks, show evidence of a planet-wide hothouse. \u201cEssentially, it got too hot everywhere,\u201d Farnsworth said. \u201cThere were much more intense and prolonged El Nino events than (are) witnessed today.\u201d A modern-day El Nino marked by a subtle elevation in the sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean is associated with poor rainfall, droughts and extreme weather events across the world. \u201cThe changes in climate patterns were profound because there were much more intense and prolonged El Nino events than witnessed today,\u201d Farnsworth said. \u201cSpecies were simply not equipped to adapt or evolve quickly enough.\u201d David Bond, a paleontologist at the University of Hull and another co-author of the study, said wildfires become common under a drought-prone climate. \u201cEarth got stuck in a crisis state where the land was burning and the oceans were stagnating. There was nowhere to hide,\u201d Bond said in a media release from the University of Bristol. \u201cWhile most life failed to adapt to these conditions, a few organisms survived, without which we wouldn\u2019t be here today,\u201d said Yadong Sun, a lead co-author at the China University of Geosciences.

        "Article Content": "At a time when we are grappling with fears around generative artificial intelligence, Apple has delivered not just a new series of iPhones but, more importantly, reassurance that privacy comes first. There is nothing predictable about the new iPhone 16 series. Sure, the design roughly follows a tried-and-tested template but the introduction of Apple Intelligence will bring about a difference in the way you use the iPhone than, say, your colleague or spouse. There are four new iPhones \u2014 iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. All of them are driven by Apple Intelligence, a suite of features that offers Apple\u2019s play on artificial intelligence. Instead of promising the sun, moon and stars that several Android brands are doing, Apple\u2019s approach is meaningful and personalised. The AI Apple is offering is across devices and at the system level. The new phones are coming when users are holding on to their smartphones longer. But there are enough meaningful features to persuade people to upgrade. The goal of Apple Intelligence is to make people do something useful and that will make more users go: \u201cI need a new iPhone.\u201d Coming at a staggered pace, Apple Intelligence features include the ability to summarise pesky notifications (yes, tackling notifications is a great use case of AI), proofread notes and messages, offering meaningful changes to whatever we want to email, making the camera identify specific types of flowers, plants or dog breeds, and Siri\u2019s ability to field some requests related to personal information on the phone, like pulling details from a text message about a family member\u2019s flight and checking airline information for real-time arrival details. By contrast, last month Google revealed a Pixel phone that can edit people into photographs that can play havoc with what we believe is the importance of photographs. Apple\u2019s cautious approach will ensure it doesn\u2019t suffer the misfires Google already has experienced like a chatbot telling users to eat rocks. Let\u2019s talk about iPhone 16\n       Among the four new iPhone 16s, two are \u201centry-level\u201d models. They come with a faster processor, a more powerful camera and the Action Button that can be programmed to automatically retrieve capabilities like the phone\u2019s flashlight. The higher models are the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max. To power Apple Intelligence, all the phones come with powerful processors. The base iPhone 16 model features the A18 chip, while the iPhone 16 Pro features an A18 Pro chip. Wall Street is, of course, enthusiastic about the artificially intelligent phones, with analysts predicting the features could help Apple sell a record 240 million iPhones next year, a 12 per cent increase from this year. Besides the new A18 chip with 3nm process there is increased battery life, Wi-Fi 7, improved thermal design for gaming with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and a new physical Camera Control button below the power button. The new A18 chip has six performance cores and four efficiency cores. It\u2019s 30 per cent faster than the iPhone 15\u2019s CPU and can use 30 per cent less power, and its GPU is 40 per cent faster while using 35 per cent less power. The A18 will also offer great gaming performance, allowing the iPhone 16 to be compatible with AAA games like Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage and Resident Evil 4. Diving into cameras, the iPhone 16\u2019s dual setup of a 48MP main camera and new autofocusing ultra-wide camera offers the \u201cequivalent\u201d of four lenses by way of a 2x crop mode and macro mode. iPhone 16 will come with a 6.1-inch screen while the larger iPhone 16 Plus gets a 6.7-inch display and the screens can reach 2,000 nits of peak brightness and go as dim as one nit. Going Pro\n       Powering the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max is the A18 Pro chip, with a 16-core neural engine that has 15 per cent faster performance than the iPhone 15 Pro. It also has improved graphics performance because of a six-core GPU that\u2019s 20 per cent faster than the iPhone 15 Pro\u2019s A17 Pro. On the Pro models, the upgraded camera system introduces a new 48MP Fusion camera with a faster, more efficient quad-pixel sensor and Apple Camera Interface, unlocking 4K120 fps video recording in Dolby Vision \u2014 the highest resolution and frame-rate combination ever available on iPhone, and a smartphone first. The new 48MP ultra-wide camera features a quad-pixel sensor with autofocus, so users can take higher-resolution 48MP ProRAW and HEIF images when capturing uniquely framed, wider-angle shots or getting close to their subjects with macro photography. The 5x telephoto camera now comes on both iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, besides both models are now capable of taking spatial photos in addition to videos to help users relive memories on Apple Vision Pro. Not enough? Users can capture 4K120 fps in slo-mo or video mode, and adjust the playback speed after capture in the Photos app, including a quarter-speed playback, a new half-speed option for a dreamy effect, and a fifth-speed option that corresponds to 24 fps. When combined with the new image signal processor (ISP) of A18 Pro, users can do frame-by-frame cinema-quality colour grading for 4K120 fps in Dolby Vision. And here\u2019s another big update: The Pro models come with four new studio-quality mics that maintain true-to-life recorded sounds, and video can now be captured in Spatial Audio for immersive listening with AirPods, Apple Vision Pro, or a surround sound system.

        "Article Content": "Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) have developed a brain-inspired analog computing platform capable of storing and processing data in an astonishing 16,500 conductance states within a molecular film.  Published on September 11 in the journal  , this breakthrough represents a huge step forward over traditional digital computers in which data storage and processing are limited to just two states, the IISc said.  In a press release, the institute said that such a platform could potentially bring complex AI tasks, like training Large Language Models (LLMs), to personal devices like laptops and smartphones, thus taking us closer to democratising the development of AI tools.  These developments are currently restricted to resource-heavy data centres, due to a lack of energy-efficient hardware. With silicon electronics nearing saturation, designing brain-inspired accelerators that can work alongside silicon chips to deliver faster, more efficient AI is also becoming crucial.  \u201cNeuromorphic computing has had its fair share of unsolved challenges for over a decade,\u201d explained Sreetosh Goswami, Assistant Professor at the Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE), IISc, who led the research team.  \u201cWith this discovery, we have almost nailed the perfect system \u2013 a rare feat,\" he said. According to IISc, the fundamental operation underlying most AI algorithms is quite basic \u2013 matrix multiplication, a concept taught in high school maths. But in digital computers, these calculations hog a lot of energy. The platform developed by the IISc team drastically cuts down both the time and energy involved, making these calculations a lot faster and easier.   The molecular system at the heart of the platform was designed by Sreebrata Goswami, Visiting Professor at CeNSE. As molecules and ions wiggle and move within a material film, they create countless unique memory states, many of which have been inaccessible so far. Most digital devices are only able to access two states (high and low conductance), without being able to tap into the infinite number of intermediate states possible.  By using precisely timed voltage pulses, the IISc team found a way to effectively trace a much larger number of molecular movements, and map each of these to a distinct electrical signal, forming an extensive \u201cmolecular diary\u201d of different states.  \u201cThis project brought together the precision of electrical engineering with the creativity of chemistry, letting us control molecular kinetics very precisely inside an electronic circuit powered by nanosecond voltage pulses,\u201d explained Goswami.  \"Tapping into these tiny molecular changes allowed the team to create a highly precise and efficient neuromorphic accelerator, which can store and process data within the same location, similar to the human brain. Such accelerators can be seamlessly integrated with silicon circuits to boost their performance and energy efficiency,\" the IISc said.  IISc researchers said the key challenge that the team faced was characterising the various conductance states, which proved impossible using existing equipment. The team designed a custom circuit board that could measure voltages as tiny as a millionth of a volt, to pinpoint these individual states with unprecedented accuracy.  It also turned this scientific discovery into a technological feat. The team was able to recreate NASA\u2019s iconic \u201cPillars of Creation\u201d image from the James Webb Space Telescope data \u2013 originally created by a supercomputer \u2013 using just a tabletop computer. They were also able to do this at a fraction of the time and energy that traditional computers would need.  Using their AI accelerator, the team recreated NASA\u2019s iconic \u201cPillars of Creation\u201d image from the James Webb Space Telescope data on a tabletop computer \u2013 achieving this in a fraction of the time and energy required by traditional systems, it said. The team includes several students and research fellows at IISc. They also collaborated with Stanley Williams, Professor at Texas A&M University and Damien Thompson, Professor at the University of Limerick, it added.   The researchers believe that this breakthrough could be one of India\u2019s biggest leaps in AI hardware, putting the country on the map of global technology innovation. Navakanta Bhat, Professor at CeNSE and an expert in silicon electronics led the circuit and system design in this project.  \u201cWhat stands out is how we have transformed complex physics and chemistry understanding into groundbreaking technology for AI hardware,\u201d Goswami explained.  \u201cIn the context of the India Semiconductor Mission, this development could be a game-changer, revolutionising industrial, consumer and strategic applications. The national importance of such research cannot be overstated,\" he said.  With support from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the IISc team is now focused on developing a fully indigenous integrated neuromorphic chip. \u201cThis is a completely home-grown effort, from materials to circuits and systems,\u201d he emphasised.  \u201cWe are well on our way to translating this technology into a system-on-a-chip,\" he added.

Dropped by the makers on Thursday, the two-minute-58-second-long trailer kicks off with Brock and Venom gripping onto an aeroplane, and Brock quipping \u201cHow does Tom Cruise do this?\u201d in his trademark sarcasm. The subsequent scenes reveal Venom informing Brock that his creator from their home planet has discovered their whereabouts on Earth and is pursuing them because they possess something he desperately needs. While Brock is hunted down by medical researchers, Venom is chased by creatures from his planet. Soon, the narrative shifts to a laboratory where researchers observe Hardy trapped in a containment cell.

        "Article Content": "Not just a style statement, the red rose has stood for beauty, power and passion every time a female protagonist has worn it in her hair. The Bollywood filmmaker who has championed the red rose is Sanjay Bhansali \u2014 even the first look of his debut web series Heeramandi on Netflix had Manisha Koirala, Sonakshi Sinha and Aditi Rao Hydari wearing red roses on their locks. We take a look at some of the red-hot red rose looks.  The Haseen Dilruba and Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba actress wears a red rose in her hair throughout the 2021 romance thriller and its dramatic sequel, which premiered on Netflix a month ago. In almost every frame, while facing any challenge and emotional upheaval, Taapsee\u2019s Rani has the red rose in place. In both the films, Vikrant Massey plays Taapsee\u2019s husband. In Sanjay Leela Bhansali\u2019s 2022 film Gangubai Kathiawadi, Alia Bhatt\u2019s all-white sari look as the powerful Gangubai is enhanced by a gajra of red roses around her bun, matching her big red bindi. Deceived and sold off to a brothel at a young age, Gangubai\u2019s story is all about how she fights the odds to live life on her own terms. The red rose was the most prominent in Bhansali\u2019s 2010 film Guzaarish, in which Aishwarya Rai Bachchan played the beautiful nurse Sophia to Hrithik Roshan\u2019s Ethan, a magician who appealed to the court to end his life after being paralysed in an accident. Aishwarya dressed up in black all through the film, with a bunch of red roses adorning her long hair, while lighting up Ethan\u2019s life with her zest.  Though in a minuscule role, Rani Mukerji\u2019s Gulabji, a courtesan in Bhansali\u2019s 2007 film Saawariya, wore a red rose in her hair while serenading Ranbir Kapoor\u2019s Ranbir Raj.    As a woman who lost her beloved husband, the Maratha Peshwa Bajirao, to the warrior princess Mastani, Priyanka Chopra\u2019s Kashibai held her ground with grace and dignity in Bhansali\u2019s 2015 film Bajirao Mastani. In one of the sequences, Priyanka dazzled in a violet sari accessorised with red roses in her bun. ",

        "Article Content": "Jamshedpur: Former Jharkhand chief minister Champai Soren on Friday joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Ranchi ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections. Champai, along with a large number of his supporters, joined the BJP in the presence of Union minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at a ceremony in Ranchi.  JMM MLA from Ghatshila and prominent tribal leader of Kolhan Ramdas Soren replaced Champai Soren in the Hemant Soren-led cabinet on Friday morning, a few hours before the latter joined the BJP. Ramdas Soren, who sought the blessing of JMM patriarch Shibu Soren before the swearing-in ceremony by governor Santosh Kumar Gangwar, was given the same portfolio as Champai (water resources department and higher and technical education department). \u201cRamdas has started his political career as gram pradhan (village head) of Ghorabandha in Jamshedpur and had been raising his voice against tribal exploitation in the East Singhbhum district and neighbouring district of West Singhbhum in the Kolhan region for nearly three decades and was among the tribal face along with Champai. He was the best bet for JMM to replace Champai Da,\u201d said a close aide of Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren. Sources in the JMM said that Hemant is keen on repeating the 2019 Assembly polls performance in the Kolhan belt \u2014 it comprises 14 Assembly seats, including Saraikela, Champai\u2019s constituency, and Ghatshila, Ramdas\u2019s seat \u2014 with the JMM. In the 2019 Assembly polls, the BJP had not been able to win any seat in the Kolhan belt where 11 seats were won by the JMM, two by the Congress, and one seat by BJP rebel turned Independent candidate Saryu Roy (Jamshedpur East). \u201cHemant wants to repeat the 2019 performance and has been focussing on the Kolhan region for a long time. Past ministers include Deepak Birua, Joba Manjhi (now an MP), and Ramdas Soren. The idea is to trump the dent that Champai is thinking of making in the region now that he has crossed over to the saffron party,\u201d a JMM source said. Champai, who joined the BJP in the presence of BJP Jharkhand Assembly poll in-charge Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Sarma (BJP\u2019s Jharkhand Assembly election co-incharge), turned emotional while giving a speech in Santhali during a public function at Ranchi on Friday and was followed by his son Babubal and several supporters. \u201cI was insulted in the organisation which I nurtured with my blood and sweat. I  had decided to retire from politics. But seeing the suffering of the people and their faith in me, I thought of forming a separate party. But after a lot of brainstorming, I decided to continue in politics,\u201d said Champai. Targeting JMM and Hemant, Champai said: \u201cI never thought that my own people would spy on me. If Santhal Pargana has to be saved, if tribals have to be saved, then only one party can do this work and that is the BJP. \u201cAt any cost, we will not let atrocities happen on tribals in Jharkhand. We will fight like our ancestors to remove the infiltrators, to save the tribals and their land.\u201d Champai served as chief minister after Hemant was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate soon after resigning from the post of chief minister in January and after Hemant was released on bail in June, Champai resigned from the post of  on July 3, paving the way for Hemant to take oath as chief minister. \u201cHemant is countering the switching over of veteran leader Champai to the BJP with a slew of popular measures like Thursday\u2019s cabinet decision of waiving  3,584 crore in power dues for around 39.44 lakh domestic consumers using 200 units of power. The move was aimed at relieving financial burdens on domestic consumers enrolled under the Mukhyamantri Urja Khushali Yojana, a scheme where consumers enjoy free electricity up to 200 units. Now they will not need to pay arrear bills,\u201d said a close aide of Hemant. The cabinet also approved the extension of the remuneration period for Anganwadi poshan sakhis (a nutrition-based initiative aimed at improving the health of women and children) and cooks from 10 to 12 months and  31.71 crore was allocated for this purpose. The cabinet also approved the re-appointment of 10,388 poshan sakhis who have a good relationship with villagers, especially women. The government also announced the resumption of the government at your doorstep scheme (holding camps at panchayats) between August 30 and September 15 to solve grievances of locals so that beneficiaries of welfare schemes derive benefit from the schemes.",

The second most senior leader of JMM in the Kolhan region comprising the industrial belt of Singhbhum, Ramdas Soren who is currently representing the Ghatshila Assembly segment will be inducted in the Jharkhand cabinet on Friday morning at Ranchi barely a few hours before former chief minister Champai Soren joins the BJP along with his son Babloo. Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan (BJP\u2019s in-charge of Jharkhand Assembly poll) and Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma (BJP\u2019s co-in-charge of Jharkhand Assembly election) will be present at the function at Shahid Maidan in Ranchi. \u201cThe decision has already been conveyed to Ramdas Soren by Hemant Soren. The move is aimed at consolidating tribal votes and stemming any attempts by the BJP to split it, taking advantage of Champai Soren. Both Ramdas and Champai have been synonymous with Jharkhand separate statehood agitation and enjoy good clout in the Kolhan region,\u201d said a close aide of Hemant Soren and a Ranchi-based JMM leader. On Wednesday evening, Champai Soren announced on social media his resignation from all party posts in the JMM and also announced stepping down from his role as MLA (Seraikela) and cabinet minister (water resources and higher and technical education portfolio). In his resignation letter addressed to JMM patriarch Shibu Soren, Champai expressed his dissatisfaction with the current working style of policies of the JMM. \u201cI am compelled to leave the party due to my discontent with the current practices and policies of the JMM. It is with great sadness that I must say that the party which we envisioned under your leadership and for which we toiled in the forests, mountains and villages, has strayed from its original direction,\u201d the letter written in Hindi states. Ramdas Soren, who is a two-term Ghatshila MLA and district president of East Singhbhum, would be joining the cabinet for the first time in his political career. Speaking to  , Ramdas Soren said that there is no ill-feeling towards Champai Soren for his decision. \u201cHe (Champai Soren) is a big leader and will remain so. I spent my youth with him and fought for the Jharkhand movement alongside him. What advice can we give him? The party has asked him to reconsider the step he took. The party gave him full respect from the beginning. There is no doubt about it. He was an MLA for six times, was made a minister thrice and was also given the chair of chief minister,\u201d said Ramdas Soren. Meanwhile, a senior JMM leader from Santhal Pargana region who is close to Hemant Soren claimed surprises for BJP in the weeks ahead of Assembly polls. \u201cThe BJP might be flying high after roping in Champai Soren. Only time will tell if their ploy to split tribal votes in Kolhan is successful or not. But be assured that BJP will be in for some bitter surprises in the weeks prior to the announcement of election schedules with at least three important MLAs switching over to JMM. \u201cBJP desperation is understandable due to the slew of popular welfare schemes announced by Hemant Soren,\u201d said the leader who is a member of the JMM central committee. He said the three MLAs include two prominent faces in the Santhal Pargana region and one from the South Chotanagpur region.",

        "Article Content": "JMM rebel and former MLA from Borio in Santhal Pargana \u2014 Lobin Hembrom \u2014 joined the BJP on Saturday, following in the footsteps of former chief minister Champai Soren. Lobin, who had represented Borio for three terms in the state Assembly and had been raising his voice against chief minister Hemant Soren\u2019s style of functioning for the last few years, was welcomed to the BJP in the presence of Jharkhand BJP Assembly election co-incharge Himanta Biswa Sarma, state party president Babulal Marandi and Champai in Ranchi. Last month, Lobin lost his Assembly membership in a defection case and was also suspended from the JMM for six years for contesting as an Independent candidate in Rajmahal Lok Sabha seat against the party\u2019s official candidate and eventual winner Vijay Hansdak. With the help of Lobin and Champai, the BJP is expected to eat into the JMM\u2019s tribal vote bank, especially after the reverses the saffron party suffered in the recent Lok Sabha polls in which it failed to win from any of the five ST-reserved seats in the state. \u201cIt is a sign that tribals are losing faith in Hemant Soren\u2019s leadership and we would see it as the beginning of the end of the JMM in Jharkhand. We would stand to gain with the entry of two tall tribal leaders both in Kolhan (Champai Soren) and Santhal Pargana (Lobin Hembrom),\u201d said BJP state spokesperson Pratul Sahdeo. Like Champai, Lobin also showed respect for JMM patriarch Shibu Soren. \u201cI still have respect for Guruji (as Shibu Soren is called by tribals) and learnt politics from him. However, the party functioning at the moment is not what it was during Guruji\u2019s time. The bow and arrow (JMM poll symbol) has lost its force. I think only the BJP can save the tribal identity, especially in launching agitation against the exploitation of tribals at the hands of infiltrators,\u201d said Lobin. The JMM leadership is not publicly exhibiting any signs of anxiousness over the developments and is banking on the slew of populist measures announced by Hemant in the run-up to the Assembly polls. \u201cLeaving of Champai and Lobin would hardly impact party fortunes in the polls. If we go by data, it can be seen that Champai da could not give a lead in the Seraikela Assembly segment in the Lok Sabha polls for the Singhbhum parliamentary seat (which was won by the JMM\u2019s Joba Manjhi) while Lobin Hembrom lost his deposit contesting as an Independent in Rajmahal Lok Sabha seat,\u201d said JMM spokesperson Tanuj Kshetri. The JMM spokesperson said the Mukhya Mantri Maiyan Samman Yojana, which provides monthly financial assistance of  1,000 to women between 20 and 50 years, the universal pension scheme, pension for dalits and tribals above 50 years, free electricity (up to 200 units) for domestic consumers and scholarship schemes for girl students have increased the JMM\u2019s and the coalition\u2019s vote banks. \u201cWe have consolidated our vote banks through popular schemes and people have got connected with our government,\u201d said Kshetri.",

        "Article Content": "A day after former Jharkhand chief minister Champai Soren joined the BJP, ex-JMM legislator Lobin Hembrom on Saturday crossed over to the saffron camp. Hembrom was given membership of the BJP by the party's state chief Babulal Marandi in the presence of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. \"The JMM has changed from what was it in Guruji's (JMM supremo Shibu Soren) time. Now, there is no respect for senior leaders in the JMM. So, I decided to join the BJP for development of Jharkhand and uplift of tribals,\" the former Borio legislator said at the saffron camp's state headquarters here. Speaking on the occasion, Sarma said, \u201cAll big leaders, who were part of separate Jharkhand movement, are now joining the BJP. The party wants overall development of the state and make it free from Bangladeshi infiltrators.\u201d He also added, \u201cJMM and Hemant Soren should also join the BJP\u2019s movement against infiltrators and leave the politics of appeasement.\" Champai Soren joined the BJP on Friday, two days after he quit the JMM citing dissatisfaction with the party\u2019s current style of functioning and \"bitter humiliation\u201d. Jharkhand BJP chief Babulal Marandi alleged, \u201cThe leaders, who nurtured JMM with their blood and sweat, are leaving the party. There is something wrong with the party. The JMM has nothing to do with tribals and indigenous people of the state. Its leaders are surrounded by middlemen and making money.\u201d Hembrom was disqualified from the Jharkhand assembly under the anti-defection law with effect from July 26. The former legislator, who had been vocal against his own party, contested as an independent candidate from the Rajmahal Lok Sabha seat, challenging JMM\u2019s nominee Vijay Hansdak. Hembrom tasted defeat in the parliamentary elections. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) had initiated proceedings under the anti-defection law against Hembrom in the Speaker\u2019s Tribunal. ",

        "Article Content": "Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren facing criticism from the BJP over the death of aspirants during excise department constable recruitment drive has directed for a \"thorough\" probe into the incident. Jharkhand director general of police (DGP) Anurag Gupta told  that acting on the directive of the chief minister, it has been decided to lodge an \"unnatural death\" case in all the death incidents during the constable recruitment drive. \u201cThe chief minister wants to know the exact reason for the unfortunate death of the aspirants. We have ordered for lodging of unnatural death cases in all deaths and awaiting the post-mortem reports. The objective is to know the exact cause of the death, whether they (aspirants) had some prior illness or whether there were lapses in terms of arrangements at the recruitment drive centres. We would also want to know if some candidates had consumed some things which had led to worsening of their health conditions,\u201d said Gupta. So far, 12 aspirants have died during the ongoing physical endurance tests as part of the recruitment drive to the posts of constables in the excise department. Doctors have said the reasons for the deaths could range from non-preparation by the candidates for the strenuous physical test and the humid weather. It was also believed that some of the candidates were taking steroids, which took a toll on their health. The ongoing recruitment drive is for 583 posts of excise constables and is being conducted at seven centres Jharkhand Jaguar campus in Ranchi, Police Line in Giridih, Jharkhand Armed Police Training Centre in Hazaribag, Chiyanki aerodrome in Palamu, CTC Musabani in East Singhbhum and Jharkhand Armed Police-9 campus in Sahibganj with each centre being allotted 74,400 candidates. Jharkhand police spokesperson and IG (operations) Amol Homkar had said on Sunday, \"Unfortunately, four candidates died in Palamu, two deaths each were recorded in Giridih and Hazaribag while one candidate died at Jharkhand Jaguar, CTC Musabani and Sahibganj centres each. We have registered cases of unnatural deaths in connection with the incident and are trying to ascertain the causes. Further action will be taken according to laws.\" One aspirant died at Palamu on Monday taking the toll to 12. The drive is scheduled to run till September 4, with a board headed by an IPS officer conducting physical tests at each centre. Homkar further said the Jharkhand Staff Selection Committee, which is overseeing the recruitment tests, had taken all possible steps to ensure that aspirants received medical assistance whenever required. \"The candidates are being provided drinking water and packets of ORS. Physical tests are scheduled early so that the applicants do not have to toil in the hottest part of the day. Medical camps, adequate medicines, ambulances, stretchers, beds and mobile toilets are available at all the centres,\" he said. The route for endurance runs has CCTV surveillance and police personnel deployed at various locations so that the candidates facing health problems can be given treatment immediately. A total of 1,27,772 aspirants appeared for the physical tests until August 30, out of which 78,023 cleared the tests. Opposition BJP has alleged that these deaths have occurred due to a lack of better management by the officials and claimed that the chief minister had asked to complete the recruitment drive in a hurry before the assembly polls leading to the conduct of the physical test in humid conditions. BJP state president Babulal Marandi has demanded a judicial probe into the matter, compensation and government jobs for the dependents of the deceased.",

        "Article Content": "The Hemant Soren-led Jharkhand cabinet continued to woo the masses with populist measures ahead of the Assembly polls in the state. The cabinet on Friday evening made several decisions that would attract lawyers, assistant police personnel and women. The cabinet approved a  5 lakh medical insurance cover for all 30,000 practising advocates in the state. Additionally, it approved two more key schemes aimed at supporting lawyers. Advocates aged 65 years and above will now receive a monthly pension of  14,000, while newly enrolled advocates will be provided a monthly stipend of  5,000 for the first five years of their practice. Jharkhand cabinet secretary Vandana Dadel said that the contributions to all three schemes will be made by the state government to Jharkhand Advocates\u2019 Welfare Fund. Jharkhand advocate-general Rajiv Ranjan, who played a crucial role in getting welfare schemes approved by the state government, said that chief minister Hemant Soren has fulfilled his promises made to lawyers at an interactive meeting held with them last year. Expressing gratitude to the chief minister, he said Jharkhand happens to be the first state in the country to frame such rules for the welfare of lawyers. \u201cIt is a message to the entire country,\u201d he added. In a move to appease the assistant police personnel, who have been on a warpath on various demands, the cabinet approved extending their service period for one more year. Their remuneration was increased to  13,000 per month and medical and accidental insurance covers were hiked to  1 lakh and  4 lakh respectively. \u201cAssistant police personnel will now get an annual allowance of  4,000 for uniforms and women police personnel will get maternity leaves at par with other contractual workers,\u201d said Dadel. In another decision, the cabinet approved a proposal to extend the monthly stipends under the Mukhyamantri Maiyya Samman Yojana to include women aged 18 years and above. Earlier, the scheme was for women aged between 21 and 50 years enabling them to receive monthly financial assistance of  1,000.   With the lowering of the slab, 8 lakh new beneficiaries will be added to the existing 48 lakh beneficiaries.",

        "Article Content": "Hemant Soren-led JMM-Congress-RJD coalition government is confident its women-centric scheme will act as a game-changer against the anti-incumbency factors and narrative of \u201cBangladeshi infiltration\u201d propelled by the Opposition BJP and help it to retain power in the ensuing Assembly poll. Sources in the chief minister\u2019s secretariat revealed that the blue-print of the Mukhya Mantri Maiyan Samman Yojana (a monthly financial assistance scheme of state government for eligible women beneficiaries between the age group of 21 and 50 years) had been prepared in January before the arrest of Hemant by the ED on alleged money laundering charges of a land scam in Ranchi. \u201cIt was evident in December 2023 that the ED was hell-bent on arresting Hemant and an inner group of advisors to Hemant Soren had conceptualised the Mukhya Mantri Maiyan Samman Yojana to help in retaining power notwithstanding anti-incumbency factors and narratives fueled by the BJP. Things were in disarray after the arrest. However, soon after his release on bail (June) the scheme was fast-tracked and was executed in August with the first instalment of the financial assistance to women beneficiaries reaching on Raksha Bandhan,\u201d informed the source. The advisors to the chief minister took solace from the records of Madhya Pradesh and Bengal respectively wherein the Shivraj Singh Chouhan\u2019s government with the Ladli Behna Yojana and the Mamata Banerjee government with Lakshmir Bhandar scheme retained power in the Assembly poll. \u201cWomen are loyal voters and are not swayed easily by religion and caste factors. We have seen it in UP with minority women voters voting for the saffron party in the past. The tremendous response to the Maiyan Samman Yojana (over 48 lakh beneficiaries have enrolled in a month) will be a game changer for us against the   and communal narrative spread by the BJP,\u201d added the source. JMM spokesperson and Giridih MLA Sudivya Kumar Sonu said that women-centric schemes have been the focus of the government ever since it came to power. \u201cWe started the universal pension scheme providing pension to single women irrespective of age criteria till 21. Even in the Abua Awas Yojana (state-funded housing scheme for rural homeless who were not kept on the list of the Centre-funded Prime Minister Awas Yojana) our priority was the women. In Savitribai Phule Yojana, we helped school and college-going girls with financial assistance and the Maiyan Samman Yojana is part of this effort. We are confident that women would help us retain power,\u201d said Sudivya Kumar, considered close to Hemant. Enthused with the success of the scheme, Hemant had in a program in Ranchi announced on Wednesday that within a few days, the government would reduce the age criteria for the Maiyan Sammaj scheme beneficiaries.",

        "Article Content": "Two outfits claiming to be a coalition of rights defenders in a fact-finding report released on Friday in Ranchi have stated that Bengali-speaking Muslims in Santhal Pargana are Indians and not Bangladeshi infiltrators as \u201cpropagated\u201d by BJP leaders in poll-bound Jharkhand. The Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha and the Loktantra Bachao Abhiyan said that their delegation had gone to Pakur and Sahibganj districts of Santhal Pargana as part of a fact-finding exercise after the BJP\u2019s \u201ccontinuous propagation\u201d that a large number of Bangladeshi infiltrators are settling in the region by grabbing tribal land and marrying Adivasi women, leading to a decline in the tribal population. \u201cThe BJP has linked some recent cases of violence with Bangladeshi infiltrators and is using it for social and political mobilisation. The fact-finding team spoke in detail with the students, victims, accused individuals, villagers from both sides, village heads and local activists in recent major cases in Pakur and Sahibganj,\u201d said Siraj Dutta, a member of the fact-finding team. \u201cThe team also studied the registered FIRs and related documents in these cases. Census data from 1901 till now, related census reports, gazetteers and research papers related to the demography of the area, were also assessed. The team found that the ground reality is far from the communal claims of the BJP,\u201d Dutta said. \u201cThe team found that all the incidents were between different local communities and people. None of the villagers \u2014 Adivasi, Hindu or Muslim \u2014 talked about the settlement of Bangladeshi infiltrators. Even the BJP mandal president living in Taranagar-Ilami said that all the Muslims of his area were locals and not infiltrators,\u201d the report claimed. \u201cAt present, a large part of the Muslim community living in Pakur and Sahibganj are Shershabadias who have been settled there for many decades. \u201cApart from them, there are Pasmanda and other Muslim communities settled in Jharkhand who have come from neighbouring states. Many among them are Jamabandi Raiyats (landholders), and many have settled here in the past few decades, having come from nearby districts or states,\u201d the report claimed. \u201cHistorically, the Shershabadia Muslim community settled along the banks of the river Ganga (from Rajmahal to present-day Rajshahi district in Bangladesh) since the Mughal era. It is also significant that in most of the villages where the BJP has raised issues, there is no history of communal violence,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThe BJP has been consistently claiming that the Adivasi population has decreased by 10-16 per cent in the past 24 years because of Bangladeshi infiltrators. First of all, there is no evidence of Bangladeshi infiltrators settling here. \u201cSecond, according to census data, in 1951, the Santhal Pargana region had 46.8 per cent Adivasis, 9.44 per cent Muslims, and 43.5 per cent Hindus. By 1991, the Adivasi population became 31.89 per cent, while the Muslim population became 18.25 per cent. According to the latest census (2011), the region had 28.11 per cent Adivasi, 22.73 per cent Muslims, and 49 per cent Hindus. Between 1951 and 2011, the Hindu population increased by 24 lakh, the Muslim population by 13.6 lakh, and the Adivasi population by 8.7 lakh,\u201d the report said.",

However, sources in the JMM informed that it was discussed on \u201cfinalising\u201d seat sharing much before the announcement of the Assembly poll in Jharkhand. Hemant, who is heading a JMM-Congress-RJD coalition government for over four years, will also have to accommodate CPI-ML and Left parties to consolidate their seats in the 81-member Assembly. In 2019 Assembly elections, the JMM, Congress and the RJD contested in a pre-poll alliance.The JMM got the lion\u2019s share and contested 43 seats, the Congress 31 seats while the RJD was in fray in seven constituencies. The JMM-Congress-RJD combine won a majority of 47, with the three parties winning 30, 16 and one seat, respectively. Meanwhile, the CPI (ML), which has one legislator in the incumbent fifth Assembly, is also trying to be a part of the INDIA bloc as it was in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Sitting CPI (ML) legislator from Bagodar, Binod Singh, contested Koderma Lok Sabha as part of the alliance but lost to BJP\u2019s Annapurna Devi. The Left leaders believe the merger of the Marxist Coordination Committee (MCC), founded by former parliamentarian A.K. Roy, with the CPI (ML) earlier this month, has strengthened their prospects. Hemant shared the photos of the meeting with Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi in Delhi along with his wife and party MLA from Gandey Kalpana Soren on his social media handle X. \u201cI was planning to meet them for a long time. It was a courtesy meeting,\u201d Hemant said while talking to reporters after the meeting. When asked if the discussion involved Jharkhand Assembly elections, the JMM chief said, \u201cIt will happen eventually\u201d. He further assured that everything else is in order, and they will contest the election with full force. He added, \u201cEverything else is fine. We will run the government, and fight election with full strength, blueprint for that will also be prepared soon.\u201d \u201cThe elections are round the corner and there is a need to work out the strategy at the earliest, be it a uniform election campaign of INDIA bloc or seat sharing. Unlike 2019, there is a possibility that the Left could also be inducted into the grand INDIA bloc. Therefore, the consultations have begun on that count,\u201d said a senior Ranchi-based JMM leader. JMM insiders also feel that all the coalition partners are eying to increase their seats as compared to 2019. While the JMM is eying to take its tally by at least 3-4 seats, the Congress is set to stake a claim on 33 seats, while the RJD has already staked a claim on 22 Party leaders aware of the discussion said the parties could also swap a few seats due to the changed scenario and local factors and the winning prospect of the party candidates would be the sole criterion. The Congress has already sent a three-member screening committee for candidate selection in Ranchi. The team took stock of the situation last week and the party invited applications from all 81 constituencies. Party insiders said over 2,500 applications have been received from across 81 seats. Later in the day, Hemant along with several cabinet ministers inaugurated the eight-storied (G+7) building of the new Jharkhand Bhavan in Delhi.",

        "Article Content": "Poll bound state of Jharkhand saw its chief minister Hemant Soren mocking Opposition BJP leaders on the issue of Bangladeshi infiltration and its alleged impact on tribal population by raising the sentimental issue of Sarna dharma code for Adivasis in the decadal census. Addressing a function at Gandey (the home constituency of his wife Kalpana Murmu Soren) in Giridih district on Monday evening, Hemant who is heading a JMM-Congress-RJD government said: \u201cOpposition leaders, some even from Assam and other states come to Jharkhand and spread narrative about Bangladeshi infiltration, love jihad and land jihad and claim that tribal population is declining. I want to ask them if they are so concerned about tribal identity then why are they not giving tribes their separate Sarna religion code? In the absence of identity, population decline is expected.\u201d \u201cWe had unanimously passed a resolution in the Jharkhand Assembly calling for a separate Sarna dharma code for tribals and sent it to the Centre but so many years have passed but they are sitting over the resolution silently,\u201d alleged Soren.    Significantly, majority of tribals in Jharkhand are Sarna followers and nature worshipers have been fighting for a separate religious identity in India for decades and in recent years have staged agitation in Delhi and other parts of the country.   Tribals argue that the implementation of a separate Sarna religious code in census surveys would allow the tribals to be identified as followers of the Sarna faith. Tribal organisations have claimed that with the Centre dropping the \u201cOthers\u201d option from the religion column for the next Census, Sarna adherents would be forced to either skip the column or declare themselves members of one of the six specified religions: Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Jain and Sikh. Hemant had in June 2022 alleged that the state Assembly had passed a resolution in a special session of the House in 2020 demanding the Sarna dharma code to be included in the Census and submitted it through the governor to the Centre. But claimed that no decision has been taken by the BJP-led central government on the issue. He had also written a letter to the Prime Minister in this connection in September 2022. Continuing his aggression against the BJP, Hemant said: \u201cEarlier OBC used to get 27 per cent reservation in Jharkhand but a former chief minister of BJP (hinting at Raghubar Das) had reduced it to 14 per cent. When we passed a bill for increasing reservations for OBC then it was stuck up in Raj Bhawan and at the Centre. There is a difference between the actions and statements of the BJP. They only try to put obstacles in our schemes from behind the screen by sending their people to file PIL in courts.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "The ruling coalition of the JMM-Congress-RJD in Jharkhand has used the Covid vaccine side-effects as a weapon to target the BJP-led Centre. Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Wednesday evening, while addressing a function to distribute beneficiaries of women's financial assistance scheme of the state government at Ranchi, blamed Covid vaccine side-effects as a possible cause of the deaths of aspirants during the physical endurance test of the constable recruitment drive for the state excise department. \u201cThere are reports of people dying due to the effects of the vaccine administered by the BJP government during the Covid pandemic. BJP got this type of vaccine administered to collect money and donations,\u201d alleged Hemant. \u201cSome incidents of death of aspirants during the constable recruitment drive have come to my notice. Many young men taking part in the recruitment drive died suddenly while running. In some parts of the country, people have died even while walking. It has come to light that vaccines against Covid administered by the BJP-led Centre to the people are having side-effects. The vaccine was banned all over the world but the same vaccine was supplied to India,\u201d Hemant further alleged. The physical endurance test for the constable recruitment drive was temporarily stopped from Tuesday after there were reports of deaths of 12 aspirants from different parts of the state in the last week. The chief minister has directed a \"thorough probe\" into the cause of the death and has also ordered temporary stoppage of the recruitment process amidst Opposition BJP blaming the \"hastiness\" and \"poor management\" by the state government as reasons for the deaths. After AstraZeneca in May announced a global withdrawal of its Covid vaccine, known as Covishield in India, doctors had voiced apprehension over the safety of Covid vaccines. The doctors associated with the Awaken India Movement (AIM) in May expressed the urgent need for a thorough review of the scientific data behind all Covid-19 vaccines. Hemant also attempted to corner Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma who is the BJP Jharkhand election co-in-charge on the Bangladeshi  . \u201cWe have a leader from Assam who arrives frequently to Jharkhand to sow the seeds of communal disharmony in the name of Hindu-Muslim, tribal-Christians. He seems to have a doctorate in spreading communal canards. He blames us for the Bangladeshi infiltration but himself admits on record that infiltrators from Bangladesh enter through Assam and go to other states. If that is the case then why can\u2019t he stop infiltration in his home state,\u201d said Hemant.",

        "Article Content": "Nearly 2,000 right activists from different parts of Jharkhand took part in a dharna reminding the Hemant Soren government of its \u201cunfulfilled\u201d promises while taking resolve to prevent a \u201cdouble bulldozer\u201d BJP government in poll-bound state. The dharna near Raj Bhavan was organised under the banner of Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha (a coalition of right outfits) and had participants carrying placards like \u201cRemove BJP, save Jharkhand\u201d and \u201cHemant Soren government, keep the promise on public issues\u201d. \u201cIn the 2019 Assembly election, the JMM-Congress-RJD alliance parties had promised action on many public issues in their manifesto. In the last 5 years, the state government has done many works as per the expectations of the people, but many important promises are still unfulfilled. We want to remind it to fulfill it before polls,\u201d said Manthan, a social activist from Jamshedpur at the protest site. \u201cAround 22 lakh acres of non-cultivated and community land of the state was put into land bank by the previous BJP government without the consent of gram sabhas and the land has been given for various government and private projects. JMM had promised to cancel it but it is yet to be done by the government,\u201d said Birsa Hembrom.   \u201cUnder the Land Acquisition Act (Jharkhand) Amendment, 2017, private and community land including multi-crop land was forcibly acquired for private and government projects without the consent of the Gram Sabha and social impact assessment. What is preventing the present government from fulfilling its promise,\u201d said James Herenz. Ajay Ekka, another activist said unfortunately even in this government, PESA rules could not be made to ensure the rights of traditional Gram Sabha on resources and local system. George Monipalli, who fights for forest rights, said that the state government is making big claims of allotment of forest pattas (land deeds)  but thousands of private and community claims of the state are pending. It was also alleged that the forest department is lodging \u201cfake cases\u2019 against farmers who have been cultivating on forest lands for years. Development economist Jean Dreze reminded that fake cases and being in jail for years as undertrials is also a big problem for tribal-Dalits. The coalition parties had promised in their manifesto that undertrial prisoners in jail for a long time would be released. But no action was taken on this. People also raised the issue of widespread malnutrition among tribal-Dalit children in the protest. Political activist Yogendra Yadav of Bharat Jodo Abhiyan said that there is a continuous effort to spread communalism in the state. \u201cThe public does not want a double bulldozer BJP rule. But the Hemant Soren government will have to support the people\u2019s struggle by acting on public issues with truth and commitment,\u201d said Yadav. The Mahasabha delegation submitted a memorandum address to chief minister Hemant Soren demanding following actions be ensured before the Assembly polls \u2014 cancelling the land bank and Land Acquisition Act (Jharkhand) Amendment, 2017, distribution of pending individual and community forest leases, notify and strictly implement the PESA rules, release undertrial prisoners who have been in jail for a long time. Protest for eggs Later, over a hundred Right to Food campaign activists from Jharkhand held a protest at Ranchi demanding immediate provision of eggs in Anganwadi \u2014 one egg per child every day, as promised by the Jharkhand government. Holding placards and waving boiled eggs, the participants distributed a booklet explaining why eggs are a must in Anganwadis. Yogendra Yadav, despite being a vegetarian and also allergic to eggs, participated in the agitation and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a must for all anganwadis children to be given eggs.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, heading a JMM-Congress-RJD coalition government in the poll-bound state, accused the BJP of trying to buy MLAs ahead of the poll. Addressing a function at Dobo in Chandil sub-division of Seraikela-Kharsawan district on Tuesday to mark\u2018Apki Yojana, Apki Sarkar, Apke Dwar (an initiative in which government holds camps at panchayat level to ensure beneficiaries are linked with welfare schemes), Soren accused the BJP of trying to topple his government from the very next day of assuming power. \u201cThey have been trying to topple our government from the very second day of our assuming power (Hemant Soren was sworn in as chief minister on December 29, 2019). For two years we battled the Covid pandemic and as soon as we started initiating welfare schemes at ground level they set CBI, ED (Enforcement Directorate) and IT behind us to disturb us,\u201d alleged Soren. \u201cIt seems they do not want us to provide financial assistance for elderlies, women, girl students and help youths and farmers stand on their feet. They have not learnt a lesson even after the 2024 Lok Sabha polls with their pride being shattered and they had to form the government on crutches,\u201d said Soren. \u201cWe see every day big leaders of the BJP trying to mislead people by flaring up the communal divide. A few days back, the Union rural development minister (Shivraj Singh Chouhan who is also BJP\u2019s Jharkhand election in-charge) was visiting in Kolhan region. Please ask the union minister why is Jharkhand getting such a low wage rate in MGNREGA. Even the meagre wage is not paid in time by the Centre,\u201d alleged Soren. In March this year, the central government notified the new daily wage rate of MGNREGA workers for the financial year 2024-25 and Jharkhand wage rate which was  228 in 2023-24 was raised to  245. The wage rate come into force from April 2024. \u201cWe heard another big leader claiming that several MLAs are in touch with him. They have been unsuccessfully trying to topple our government by purchasing MLAs and breaking our party. They are not elected by people but form government by money power with help from their capitalist friends,\u201d alleged Soren. Assam chief minister and Jharkhand BJP election in-charge Himanta Biswa Sarma had on Monday speaking to reporters at Ranchi Airport claimed that many of the MLAs from Jharkhand Congress and JMM are in regular contact with him, but there are not enough places in the BJP to accommodate them. Soren also criticized the BJP leaders terming them as \u2018vultures\u2019 who create communal tensions for electoral gains prior to polls in the state.",

        "Article Content": "Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren has gone all out to woo the masses ahead of the Assembly poll. On Wednesday, addressing a rally to mark the distribution of assets to beneficiaries of government welfare schemes in Godda district Hemant said that if voted to power the government will transfer  1 lakh annually to each family. \u201cWe understand the condition of the poor in a state like Jharkhand and want to help the people so that they do not have to depend on money lenders. In the next five years we will transfer  1 lakh annually to each family in the state,\u201d said Hemant. The announcement came even as the BJP is preparing for the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Jamshedpur on September 15 to flag off the Vande Bharat train and also address a meeting of BJP leaders to chalk out strategy for the Jharkhand Assembly poll. \u201cWe have already started transferring monthly  1,000 to each women beneficiaries as part of the Jharkhand Mukhyamantri Maiyan Samman Yojana (eligible women beneficiaries between 18-50 age group will receive  1,000 monthly through direct benefit transfer) and also giving pension to senior citizens, tribals and Dalits after 50 years,\u201d said Hemant. Trumpeting his coalition (JMM-Congress-RJD) government achievement in the last four and half years, Hemant said: \u201cThe developmental schemes initiated by our government will be difficult for BJP to replicate. They (BJP) know the poll outcome and are hiring outside leaders to keep vultures eyes on Jharkhand and conspire to break the society in the name of Hindu-Muslim, tribal and Christians. People should be alert and not let them enter their villages.\u201d The chief minister mentioned the agricultural loan waiver of  2 lakh for farmers, waiver of electricity bills and making 200 units of power free for domestic consumers, government free housing scheme for homeless health care and financial assistance for students and girls. Hitting out at the BJP, Hemant alleged that the saffron party was only keen on winning the state to loot minerals and forests for their corporate friends. \u201cThey want to come to power at any cost and have already started the game plan of poaching MLAs and even former chief ministers (indirectly hinting at Champai Soren) for electoral gain. They want to rule over the state to loot the mineral and forest resources for their corporate friends. It is for this reason that they have tweaked the forest conservation rules,\u201d alleged Hemant. Significantly, the Forest (Conservation) Amendment Bill 2023 was passed by the Parliament last year amending provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Further accusing the BJP of putting obstacles before the state government\u2019s attempt to initiate welfare schemes, Hemant said: \u201cWhenever we implement welfare schemes the BJP leaders have stomach pain and use their people to put obstacles through courts and other means.\u201d Taking a dig at Prime Minister\u2019s visit to Jamshedpur (on September 15), Hemant Soren said, \u201cThe Centre\u2019s mukhiya has no time for Manipur which is burning in communal strife for over a year. They cannot go to Haryana and Jammu Kashmir as farmers and common masses are against them, they are now targeting Jharkhand.\u201d Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana will go for assembly polls in September and October this year respectively.",

        "Article Content": "The JMM, which is heading the ruling coalition government in Jharkhand (with Congress and RJD), challenged the Prime Minister and Union home minister to announce the inclusion of the Sarna religion code in the census during their respective visit to the poll-bound state later this month. \u201cWe have read in the media about the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah to our state this month. The tribals would be ever grateful if the Prime Minister and the Union home minister announced the inclusion of the Sarna dharma code for tribal in the census during their visit. We are looking forward to their announcement,\u201d said JMM central general secretary and spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya at Ranchi on Thursday. The majority of tribals in Jharkhand are Sarna followers and nature worshipers have been fighting for a separate religious identity in India for decades and in recent years have staged agitation in Delhi and other parts of the country.   Tribals argue that the implementation of a separate Sarna religious code in census surveys would allow the tribals to be identified as followers of the Sarna faith.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be visiting the state to transfer the first instalment of funds into the bank accounts of 1.13 lakh beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) at Jamshedpur on September 15.  He is also scheduled to flag off several Vande Bharat trains and launch railway projects. Union home minister Amit Shah is likely to sound the poll bugle in Jharkhand by flagging off BJP\u2019s \u2018Parivartan Yatra\u2019 from Dumka on September 21. Shah will be joined by the Chief Ministers of four states \u2014 Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh. As per BJP party sources in order to \u201cexpose the failures\u201d of the ruling JMM-led alliance government in the state, the BJP will organise six \u2018Parivartan yatras\u2019 ahead of the polls. The yatra is being considered crucial for the party in Jharkhand, where BJP is eyeing a comeback. \u2018Parivartan Yatra\u2019 will be against corruption, false promises, deteriorating law and order, rising crimes against women, illegal infiltration, changing demography and other issues,\u201d said a Ranchi-based BJP leader. Bhattacharya further expressed hope that both the Prime Minister and the home minister should show their \u2018seriousness\u2019 towards the development of Jharkhand by \u201cpaying outstanding coal royalties of  1.36 lakh crore\u201d.",

        "Article Content": "Authorities of the North Bengal Medical College & Hospital (NBMCH) have expressed concern over the inadequate number of private security personnel on campus, admitting they did not have funds to engage additional security. In north Bengal, NBMCH is the largest state-run medical college and referral hospital, spread over 104 acres. It caters to the population of north Bengal and neighbouring states of Bihar, Sikkim and Assam. Sanjay Mallick, the medical superintendent of NBMCH, said that as of now, the campus was covered by 80 private security personnel and four supervisors. \u201cThey work in three shifts, which means, around 25 to 28 persons work in each shift. This clearly shows that the current workforce is stretched thin. We are worried as to whether we can maintain the stipulated security standards, especially in critical areas such as the emergency ward, the ICU and other sections where hundreds of people walk in daily,\u201d said Mallick. Earlier this week, chief minister Mamata Banerjee, at an administrative meeting in Nabanna, had said that security should be stepped up in all the state-run medical colleges for the safety of doctors and other staff. Mallick said most of the medical colleges in Calcutta and its suburbs had multi-storey buildings like RG Kar with fewer entry points. \u201cBut NBMCH is spread over a vast area. There are at least seven entry points to different wards and sections. That is why we need around 80 security personnel in each shift to ensure that at least one of them is posted in a ward or a section,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, however, don\u2019t have any option to engage more security personnel as we don\u2019t have additional funds to bear the expenses,\u201d the hospital superintendent added. In NBMCH, private security personnel control the crowd, ensure the safety of doctors, other staff and patients and handle other emergencies. In August, a meeting was held among the NBMCH authorities, the district magistrate and officials of Siliguri Metropolitan Police at the Siliguri Municipal Corporation to address the ongoing security concerns at the campus. At the meeting, various security measures were discussed to improve the safety of the sprawling campus. One of the outcomes was the deployment of women police constables in NBMCH. \u201cA standard operating procedure (SOP) was recommended to the NBMCH authorities and personnel posted at the NBMCH police outpost. According to the SOP, a meeting would be held once a week to review campus security. All staff should carry ID cards for easy identification and CCTVs should be monitored weekly,\u201d said a source. As of now, around 15 women cops have been posted at the NBMCH ladies\u2019 hostels.",

        "Article Content": "Beseiged Bengal saw a different Mamata Banerjee on Thursday. One with folded hands. The firebrand chief minister displayed a rare mellowness and restraint as she repeatedly entreated the junior doctors to end their cease-work for the sake of their distressed patients, and apologised to the public for her failure to find a solution so far. But, the seasoned politician she is, Mamata also tried to push the agitating medicos on the back foot, subtly emphasising how she had walked the extra mile to facilitate a dialogue and obliquely suggesting the protest had behind-the-scenes political backing. \u201cPlease return to work,\u201d she said, palms juxtaposed in appeal, during a televised address to the medicos, who have been protesting since the August 9 rape and murder of a postgraduate trainee at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. \u201cWe also want justice for Tilottoma,\u201d she said, underscoring that she was on the same page with the protesters. The junior doctors\u2019 cease-work has hobbled the public health delivery system in Bengal for the last 35 days \u2014 Mamata claimed it had caused 27 deaths and denied treatment to more than 7 lakh patients. The first hopes of a breakthrough had emerged on Tuesday, when the government and the junior doctors opened a channel of communication by exchanging emails that explored the possibility of a dialogue. After three rounds of emails over two days \u2014 during which both sides conceded ground to pave the way for a dialogue \u2014 a busload of junior doctors arrived at Nabanna around 5.20pm on Thursday. But the hopes of a solution were dashed even before the two sides could reach the talks table: the medicos refused to engage in a dialogue unless the government agreed to live-stream the discussions from inside the Nabanna Sabhaghar. After spending more than two hours at the meeting venue, rows of empty chairs arrayed in front of her, a sombre Mamata appeared before the cameras to address the protesters and the public. \u201cI tried my best to sit with the junior doctors.... I spent three days for them \u2014 waiting, waiting, waiting. I waited for three days with my highest officials. I am sorry. I apologise to the people of the country and the entire world,\u201d she said, admitting her failure to find a solution to the stalemate. Mamata said the junior doctors could have raised any question they wanted at the scheduled meeting. \u201cI am even willing to resign for the sake of the people.... I don\u2019t need the chief minister\u2019s chair. I want justice for Tilottoma,\u201d she said. Mamata took care to explain that while arrangements had been made to \u201crecord\u201d (film) the proceedings \u2014 which the government was willing to share with the doctors\u2019 delegation as a transparency measure \u2014 live-streaming the discussions was not possible because of \u201cprocedural issues\u201d. \u201cWe have to follow the process as the matter is being heard by the Supreme Court. The matter is (being) investigated by the CBI and there are issues pertaining to the investigation,\u201d she said. The chief minister appealed to the protesting doctors\u2019 conscience. \u201cWaiting patiently for a resolution is like a test.... Please care for the patients and I urge you to return to work,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had expected an open discussion.... We told them to bring a 15-member delegation, but 34 of them came for the meeting. We allowed all of them, but they didn\u2019t even enter the meeting room.\u201d Trying to convey that the government had bent backwards to accommodate the junior doctors, Mamata underlined that she had not invited any health department officials \u2014 the protesting doctors are up in arms against some of them \u2014 to the meeting. \u201cI did not bring my phone to the meeting room as no one was allowed to come with their phone,\u201d she added. While her appeal for an end to the cease-work had not yielded results till late in the night, she seemed to have succeeded in wrong-footing the protesters who, through the evening, kept trying to justify their demand for live-streaming. Multiple sources in the state government and the medical fraternity said the possibility of a resolution looked brighter now with the junior doctors likely to come under pressure following the chief minister\u2019s appeal. Mamata promised not to take any punitive action against the protesting junior doctors \u2014 unlike Uttar Pradesh, she said without much elaboration \u2014 won her plaudits from several doctors, who did not wish to be named. \u201cThis stance of the government will make it difficult for the juniors to continue with the agitation as ordinary people may not like such hardening of their position,\u201d a senior doctor, who had participated in some of the protest marches, said. Mamata\u2019s speech made it clear that she was also addressing the public in general, who had come out in large numbers in urban and semi-urban areas in support of the protesting doctors. \u201cThe people of Bengal do have sympathy for Tilottoma.... We all agree with her family that the CBI should complete the investigation,\u201d is how she began her address, adopting a placatory tone. In the second half of her speech, however, she tossed up several questions for the public at large to ponder over. \u201cThe ordinary people supported the movement seeking justice for Tilottoma.... But there was a demand for chair (a change of guard),\u201d Mamata said. She questioned the rationale behind the personal attacks on her during the protest and the barrage of \u201cmisinformation and disinformation\u201d on social media. She also raised a key question \u2014 whether some of the junior doctors were \u201ctaking instructions from outside\u201d. \u201cI know that some of them wanted to engage, to enter the meeting room for a dialogue.... But there were two-three among them who were receiving instructions from outside,\u201d Mamata said, questioning by implication the protesters\u2019 claim of being \u201capolitical\u201d. An observer who has followed Mamata\u2019s political career said the 25-minute address was one of her best. \u201cIt was a very sensitive appeal and she came across as someone saying what she believed in.... Besides, she also tactically touched on the issue of morality \u2014 how doctors need to repay society and the State, which have a role in grooming them,\u201d the observer said.",

        "Article Content": "Senior Trinamul Congress leader Kunal Ghosh on Friday claimed that some Opposition political forces have hatched a conspiracy to attack the protesting junior doctors to defame the Mamata Banerjee government and the ruling party of West Bengal. The medics\u2019 sit-in outside Swasthya Bhavan, the state health department headquarters, entered the fourth day on Friday. They are demanding removal of top officials of the department for their alleged involvement in corruption in medical colleges in the state. Holding a press conference, Ghosh, a former Rajya Sabha MP, played a purported audio clip in which two persons are heard planning to \"attack the junior doctors on their return from (state secretariat) Nabanna on September 12 night\". The medics had gone to Nabanna on September 12 to hold talks with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to resolve the RG Kar impasse. The meeting, however, did not take place as the state government did not agree to live-streaming the talks as demanded by junior doctors. \"The audio clip makes it clear that some people wanted to attack the junior doctors last night and they may be at the game again. We have asked the police and security forces to be on alert and ensure that it doesn't happen. We are hopeful about peacefully resolving the issue,\" the TMC leader said. PTI did not independently verify the authenticity of the audio clip. Ghosh asserted that the party has credible information that some Left and ultra Left parties are conspiring to infiltrate into the ranks of the protestors and carry on attacks to defame the TMC and the Mamata Banerjee government. He alleged that Left parties and BJP have joined hands to foment large-scale disturbances at their sit-in spot and create a situation which can be exploited by them to shift the blame on the TMC. The junior doctors have been demonstrating outside Swasthya Bhavan since September 10 to protest against alleged corruption in the medical education sector. The CBI which is investigating financial irregularities in state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital arrested its former principal Sandip Ghosh. The central agency is also probing the rape and murder of a postgraduate trainee in the same hospital on August 9, following which junior doctors have been on \u2018cease work\u2019 demanding justice for the victim and stronger security measures at medical establishments. Kunal Ghosh said, \"We are not against peaceful democratic protests. Our leader, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, has repeatedly said she is ready to hold discussions with the junior doctors in an open mind (to solve the impasse).\" \tWhile most of the agitating doctors are willing to resolve the deadlock and hold discussions in a positive manner, a handful of outsiders from the Left and ultra-Left outfits don't want any solution, he claimed. \"They are doing a politics of vulture. Plans are afoot to bring hoodlums from outside Kolkata,\" the TMC leader said. Ghosh alleged leaders of various political parties, including the CPI(M) and the BJP, are visiting the sit-in site with a political agenda and trying to influence the agitating junior doctors. Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari said the BJP will not allow anyone to touch junior doctors. Alleging that the TMC was plotting a conspiracy against the movement, Adhikari said, \"If any untoward incident happens, people of Bengal will paralyse the state. Our party workers and supporters will also be among them.\" ",

        "Author Name": "Md Salim",

        "Article Content": "I met Sitaram Yechury for the first time when I went to attend the all-India conference of the SFI in Mumbai in 1980. I was a young student activist and the conference platform allowed me to come in contact with Sitaram. Since then, it has been four-and-a-half decades that we have worked together. Sitaram\u2019s untimely passing, for me, is in a true sense losing a friend, philosopher and guide. The grief is even greater as Sitaram\u2019s loss comes a little over a month after we lost our comrade Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. As he was indisposed, Sitaram could not travel to Calcutta to take part in the last journey of Buddha-da and who knew that his recorded speech from AIIMS on August 22 for Buddha-da\u2019s memorial meeting at Netaji Indoor Stadium would be in a sense his last public appearance. Sitaram\u2019s stood out among his comrades because of his affable nature. It did not matter to him whether the person was his ideological friend or foe. He would debate or discuss with an open mind, and his radiant smile would stick to him. Such was his amicable nature that he could win the hearts even of his harshest critics. Always accessible to everyone, journalists in Delhi would tell me that his friendly nature made him the \u201cdarling of the media\u201d.  His accessibility was rooted in the days he spent in the students\u2019 movement. A disciple of our leader (Makineni) Basavapunnaiah, Sitaram was theoretically sound and ideologically resolute.   A brilliant student, who graduated in economics from St. Stephen\u2019s College in Delhi, Sitaram took a plunge into politics when he joined Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) as a postgraduate student in economics in the 70s. At the JNU, he began his political journey as a member of the Students\u2019 Federation of India, where he was elected president of the students\u2019 union thrice. On multiple occasions, he showed his guts as a student leader. In 1978, when Sitaram was the JNU students\u2019 union president, he read out a chargesheet against former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in her presence. Although Indira had lost the elections in 1977, she continued to be the chancellor of the JNU, prompting Sitaram and his comrades to show defiance in front of the former Prime Minister. Such was his courage and spirit of resistance that Indira resigned from the post after the collective show of protest and Sitaram led the students to an iconic victory. Talking about his days at the JNU reminds me of an incident involving Sitaram and me in Calcutta. Former Prime Minister V.P. Singh had rebelled, left the Congress and formed his political party Jan Morcha in 1987. Shortly after he formed the party, several Opposition parties came together to hold a meeting at Netaji Indoor Stadium. Political leaders who attended the meeting included V.P. Singh, (Hemvati Nandan) Bahuguna, Jyoti Basu and Sitaram. Apart from political leaders, eminent educationist Debiprasad Chattopadhyay was present, so was a respected JNU professor, whose name I cannot recollect right now. As a DYFI leader, I was among the volunteers at the meeting and took care of the leaders while they took the stage. As I was carrying out my assigned duty,  Sitaram called me and said: \u201c  (because of you I was reprimanded).\u201d I had no clue and asked him: \u201cwhat wrong did I do?\u201d  Then Sitaram told me what transpired between Debiprasad Chattopadhyay and his JNU professor, who was sitting next to V.P. Singh. Pointing at me, Prof Chattopadhyay, my teacher at Jadavpur University, told the JNU professor about me not enrolling for PhD despite his persuasions. And he said that it was because of my plunge into politics that I did not join research. At this, the JNU professor told Prof Chattopadhyay that he had a similar complaint against Sitaram. He had repeatedly asked Sitaram to complete his PhD but politics took him away from academics.  As all this happened in Sitaram\u2019s presence, he called me to say that his teacher had forgotten about him not  doing PhD and now because of my professor and me, the issue came up. And then, as usual, he flashed his  unforgettable smile. The other aspect of Sitaram that we will miss is his being the virtual ambassador for Bengal and his ability to converse in Bengali helped. Even before he became a Rajya Sabha member from Bengal, during the earlier regimes run by the Congress or the UPA, he was like an ambassador for Bengal in Delhi.  He was always there for the cause of Bengal and Jyoti Basu liked him very much. When Jyoti Basu and HKS Surjeet used to go on foreign trips as part of party delegations, they would take Sitaram along with them. This brought him in contact with communist and workers\u2019 parties across the globe, a contact he maintained throughout. What will be missed in the passing of Comrade Sitaram is his ability to strike a bond between parties across the spectrum. Whenever he came to Bengal, Sitaram would often say that the resurgence of the Left in India would not be possible without the rejuvenation of the CPM in Bengal. As our comrade sleeps, we pledge to fulfil his dream. ",

        "Article Content": "West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said she was \"ready to resign\" for the \"sake of people\" and expressed regret over the junior doctors' refusal to come for talks to resolve the impasse over the R G Kar rape-murder case. Banerjee, who waited for nearly two hours for the agitating doctors to come for the meeting, said she also wanted the victim to get justice, and apologised to the people of West Bengal for the continued deadlock. \"We have tolerated a lot of canards and insults for the last 33 days,\" she said at a press conference but assured the protesters that despite violating the Supreme Court directive by not resuming duties, she would not take action against them. In a dramatic turn of events, agitating junior doctors, who reached the gates of the state secretariat (Nabanna), refused to hold talks with the state government unless their demand for live streaming of the meeting was met. The talks were to be held at 5 pm in the presence of Banerjee as demanded by the protesters, who after reaching the secretariat around 5.25 pm, stayed put at the venue gate. Banerjee said the meeting with the junior doctors cannot be live-streamed as demanded by them because the issue is sub-judice and before the Supreme Court. She said her government had made arrangements to record it and hand over the recording to them with the permission of the SC if needed. \"For the sake of the people, I am ready to resign. I also want the victims to get justice, but this is not the way. We have tolerated a lot of canards and insults for the last 33 days. I thought the junior doctors would engage in talks for the sake of the patients and on humanitarian grounds,\" she said. \"We have been waiting for over two hours, hoping that reason would guide the junior doctors...I apologise to the people, who expected that the issue would be resolved today,\" she said and claimed that \"external instructions\" were influencing some junior doctors not to engage in discussions. Referring to negative comments against her government on social media, she said: \"Many tried to malign our government even on social media. People came out for justice but they don't know that there is a political colour diverting it...They want the chair. I am ready to resign from my post for the sake of the people. I don't want the chair.\" Noting that around 27 patients have died and approximately 7 lakh people have suffered because of the ongoing 'cease work' by the junior doctors, Banerjee said, \u201cI too want justice for the victims, but the doctors must rejoin work following the SC verdict.\u201d The Chief Minister added that she is not acting against the agitating doctors and has forgiven them, as she is \"older than the doctors.\" \"I am still saying that I will not take any action against them for not coming and making us wait for two hours. I will forgive them because as elders, it is our responsibility to forgive our younger ones,\" she asserted. \"I waited for three days for them to come, but they did not come...violated the SC directive. They have not rejoined work. But we have not taken any action as at times you need to deal with such situations with patience,\" she said. Banerjee said she wanted discussions with them with an open mind as solutions can be reached only through discussions. The junior doctors began their strike on August 9, hours after the body of the female trainee was found in the seminar room of the hospital. Since then, the protest has escalated, leading to disruptions in healthcare services at state-run hospitals across West Bengal. ",

        "Article Content": "Junior doctors continued their 'cease work' and sit-in demonstration outside the West Bengal Health Department headquarters for the third consecutive day on Friday, a day after the proposed talks to resolve the RG Kar hospital impasse between agitating junior doctors and the Bengal government failed to take off. Around 30 medics, representing 26 medical colleges participating in the stir, had visited Nabanna for the meeting that failed to materialise after the government did not accept the doctors' demand for live-streaming of the talks. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said the meeting with the junior doctors cannot be live-streamed as demanded by them because the issue is sub-judice and before the Supreme Court. She said her government had made arrangements to record it and hand over the recording to them with the permission of the apex court if needed. The agitating doctors said their demonstration outside 'Swathya Bhavan', the state health department headquarters, will continue until key demands are met, including the suspension of Police Commissioner, Health Secretary, Director of Health Services, and Director of Medical Education. \"We will continue our agitation despite wanting to resume our work, but not until our demands are met,\" members of the protesting doctors' forum said. The state government and the CM have repeatedly urged the doctors to resume work. Though Thursday's talks failed to take place, protesting doctors maintained that they still desire a meeting, but only in a completely transparent manner, which they believe is only possible through live-streaming. Doctors said many common people showed spontaneous solidarity by bringing food and essentials, either by cutting back on their Durga Puja festival budget or celebrating birthdays with the protestors. \"I am offering my respect to these living gods for the future of my 11-year-old daughter,\" said a father who distributed sweets to the protesting medics. \"We are overwhelmed by such support in this endeavor for justice for R.G. Kar, which is helping us keep our morale high,\" said a protesting junior doctor. A large contingent of police personnel has been deployed in and around 'Swathya Bhavan' at Salt Lake to maintain law and order and ensure smooth traffic movement. ",

        "Article Content": "An impasse over the live telecast of the meeting between agitating junior doctors and the chief minister and her top brass at Nabanna on Thursday prevented any breakthrough to the 32-day protests since the RG Kar tragedy. Junior doctors, who reached Nabanna, did not budge from their demand for a live telecast of the proceedings even as top state officials explained to them why it could not be done and Mamata Banerjee waited in her chamber to meet the delegation. Officials said the proceedings could be videographed but drew the line at live telecast, citing government protocol as the matter was sub-judice. Finally, the team of junior doctors left Nabanna.  Around 2pm on Thursday, state chief secretary Manoj Pant sent an email to the junior doctors inviting them to a meeting at 5pm at Nabanna. He made it clear that chief minister Mamata Banerjee would be present in the meeting, which was a demand by the agitating doctors. \u201cThe chief secretary had sent a letter to the junior doctors on Wednesday inviting them to a meeting.... But, the junior doctors did not respond positively and demanded they wanted the chief minister\u2019s presence in the meeting. This is the reason why the chief secretary clearly mentioned in his mail on Thursday that the chief minister would be present in the meeting,\u201d said a senior official. However, the state government did not accept their other two demands \u2014 live telecast of the meeting and allowing 30 delegates from the junior doctors, which they had mentioned in their reply by mail to the chief secretary on Wednesday. \u201cThe chief secretary made it clear that 15 delegates from the junior doctors\u2019 side would be allowed to attend the meeting and there would be no live telecast of the meeting,\u201d said an official. However, junior doctors stuck to these demands in their mail sent to the chief secretary at 3.53pm on Thursday. Then, senior officials discussed the issue with the chief minister and decided that they would allow 30 delegates as per their demands. When junior doctors reached Nabanna Sabhaghar by bus at 5.23pm, the officials found that there were 32 delegates from the junior doctors\u2019 side. \u201cWe decided to allow all the delegates to the meeting hall. But they did not enter the meeting hall saying they would not attend the meeting if live telecast was not allowed,\u201d said chief secretary Pant. All the senior officials, including Pant, home secretary Nandini Chakraborty and DGP Rajeev Kumar held discussions with the junior doctors outside the hall repeatedly and tried to persuade them to attend the meeting. When all the efforts fell flat, the chief secretary and the DGP held a news conference at Nabanna to brief why the government could not allow a live telecast of the meeting. \u201cNo live telecast of any government meeting is allowed.... Live telecast is allowed for the portion of the meeting where the general public needs to be addressed. Also, press conferences after any government meeting can be telecast live,\u201d said DGP Rajeev Kumar. Pant added that the live telecast of the meeting could not be allowed as the matter is sub-judice. \u201cWe have made it clear to the junior doctors that video recording will be done of the entire meeting to maintain transparency.... But they did not accept it,\u201d added the chief secretary. As the chief secretary and other senior officials tried to persuade the junior doctors, Mamata waited in the  meeting hall, being briefed constantly about the developments outside.  \u201cThe chief minister was waiting patiently while the senior officials were trying to persuade the junior doctors to come inside the meeting venue... The chief minister waited calmly. But when discussions did not bear the desired result, she left for her chamber on the 14th floor of Nabanna at around 6.55pm,\u201d said an official. When the junior doctors left Nabanna, senior officials went to meet Mamata to discuss the next course of action. \u201cWe will try to hold the meeting again.... The chief minister has made it clear that if the junior doctors want to attend a meeting, the senior officials should welcome them,\u201d said a bureaucrat.",

        "Article Content": "The Manipur government lifted the temporary ban on broadband internet services in the five valley districts on a \"conditional\" basis. However, the suspension of mobile internet services will remain in place, officials said on Friday. The five-day ban was imposed on September 10 following student protests demanding the removal of the DGP and security advisor for their alleged inability to handle attacks by militants. A notification by Commissioner (Home) N. Ashok Kumar stated, \"The state government has made a considered decision to lift the suspension in the case of broadband service (ILL and FTTH) conditionally in a liberalised manner, subject to fulfillment of terms and conditions.\"  \tIt further specified, \"Connection will be through static IP and the subscriber concerned shall not accept any other connection other than the allowed for the time being.\"  \tAdditionally, it said, \"No wifi/hotspots shall be allowed from any of the routers,\" and that blocking of social media and VPNs at the local level shall be enforced by the subscriber. The state government, however, decided to continue the suspension of mobile internet data due to concerns about spread of disinformation and rumours through social media, which could mobilise agitators and demonstrators, potentially leading to loss of life and damage to public and private property. The protests resulted in clashes with security forces, injuring more than 80 people, including students and police personnel. Meanwhile, while conducting security operations, security forces recovered a 7.5-foot country-made rocket in the thickly forested Shejang area of Churachandpur district, Manipur Police said. During the operations, authorities also seized a modified M-16 rifle, a large-size country-made mortar, a medium-size country-made mortar, three medium bomb launchers, four bomb launchers, and three bombs.",

        "Article Content": "Within the galaxy of student leaders emerging from the 1970s\u2019 churn in India to rise and lead major political parties for the next four decades, Sitaram Yechury was the intellectual lodestar. His untimely demise on Thursday, at age 72, shall immensely sadden every Indian citizen committed to preserve and strengthen our secular, democratic republic and fight for a just society, free from exploitation.  Comrade Sitaram was a role model for generations of student activists. As a topper of an all-India board examination, a first-class graduate from Delhi\u2019s St Stephen\u2019s College and a first-class postgraduate in economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University, he could have attained distinction as a professional academic, had he chosen that career. Yet, as the president of the JNU students\u2019 union \u2014 elected thrice \u2014 and leader of the student resistance against the Emergency, he dedicated himself to the Communist cause and became a whole-time member of the CPI(M). It was under his leadership that the Students\u2019 Federation of India emerged as the leading Left-wing student organisation across many states in the country. For him, \u201cstudy and struggle\u201d was not merely a popular slogan for university wall graffiti, but a way of life, which he himself lived and inspired many others to pursue. As a young leader working at the CPI(M)\u2019s party centre in Delhi from the 1980s, Sitaram Yechury worked closely with many communist stalwarts and learnt from all of them. He imbibed a rare combination of erudition, inspired by the likes of B.T. Ranadive, P. Sundarayya and E.M.S. Namboodiripad, alongside statesmanship and the craft of coalition building, following Jyoti Basu and Harkishan Singh Surjeet.   The generation of leaders Comrade Sitaram led and represented had the difficult task of navigating the Communist party out of the ideological turmoil following the collapse of the USSR and surviving in an increasingly globalised world dominated by finance capital and Rightwing politics, where programmatic postulates of the party were often overwhelmed by everyday events as well as long-term developments. Both as an ideologue and a practitioner of parliamentary politics, Sitaram Yechury attempted to seek answers outside orthodoxy and dogmatism. In the unfinished task of the Left\u2019s revival in India, this would be his enduring legacy. Comrade Sitaram was a firm believer in the \u2018Idea of India\u2019, which evolved through our freedom struggle and found expression in our secular and democratic Constitution. He never saw the revival of the Left in India as a project independent of the task of defending India\u2019s constitutional order from the onslaught of majoritarian communalism, political authoritarianism and crony capitalism. He was among the principal architects of the INDIA coalition, which offered us hope in dark times. His bright and affable presence would be missed by the entire Opposition in the united battles that lie ahead.   Comrade Sitaram was also an unapologetic internationalist. His commitment to democracy and social justice extended beyond India\u2019s borders, which would be fondly remembered by the people of Nepal, Cuba and Palestine. Always careful to distinguish between patriotism and chauvinism, he believed in India learning from others as much as in India teaching them.",

There is a plan to start these new bus services from Siliguri on September 18,\u201d he added. As of now, nine rocket service buses of NBSTC connect Calcutta with different parts of north Bengal. The new buses to be launched next week have 35 seats, in-built CCTV cameras and vehicle location tracking devices (VLTD).  ",

        "Article Content": "The Jalpaiguri branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has recommended the suspension of Sushanta Roy, a veteran eye specialist who is the secretary of the branch, along with his doctor son and another doctor.  There are allegations that all three of them were present at the RG Kar Medical  College & Hospital (RGKMCH) in Calcutta after the gruesome rape and murder of a doctor on August 9.  The move follows a decision made by the Bengal branch of the IMA that suspended Ghosh a couple of days back.  On Wednesday, some office bearers and members of the IMA in Jalpaiguri held a meeting which continued till late night.  \u201cAt the meeting, it has been decided that we will recommend the dissolution of the executive committee of the Jalpaiguri branch of IMA, along with the suspension of Sushanta Roy, (his son) Soutrik Roy, who is a joint secretary of the committee, and Avik Dey, a vice-president of the branch,\u201d said  Pantha Dasgupta, a senior doctor and a member of IMA. Soutrik is Sushanta\u2019s son.  Avik is a former PGT at the SSKM hospital in Calcutta. All three of them were allegedly present in RG Kar, even though none of them were associated with the health institution where the crime took place.   \u201cWe will send our recommendation to the IMA headquarters to take appropriate steps,\u201d  Dasgupta added.  Avik, an ex-student of North Bengal Medical College & Hospital (NBMCH), was in the line of fire last week. Protesters at his alma mater had alleged his role in malpractices during exams at NBMCH. \u201cIt is surprising that Avik, who is not based in Jalpaiguri, was an office bearer of IMA in Jalpaiguri. This reconfirms the highhandedness of some doctors whose names figured in the RG Kar case,\u201d said a senior doctor of the town.  He said that the IMA branch was forced to act as questions were raised over the branch\u2019s silence after the RG Kar brutality.  \u201cUnlike other places, no activity was taken up by the IMA in Jalpaiguri after the August 9 incident. At the meeting (on Wednesday night), it was also decided that some activities would be taken up in due course,\u201d he said.",

        "Article Content": "Nicolae Ceausescu was still ruling Romania. Rising from the Romanian Communist youth movement, Ceausescu was the undisputed leader of the European nation since he assumed power in 1965. Cut to 1989. Sitaram Yechury had returned from a tour of Romania and anti government protests had begun against Ceausescu. \u201cA little while after Sita returned from Romania it was time for the students\u2019 union elections at JNU. I was a candidate on an SFI ticket and spoke at the presidential debate. Sita, as he was fondly called, was also among the speakers as JNU tradition allows former student union functionaries to speak. In my speech, I had referred to Ceausescu and the uprising against him. I said Ceausescu was a Romanian dictator and must go. Speaking after me, Sita did not contest me. He gave his view that Ceausescu would be able to overcome the uprising. That was the beauty of Sita. Even though we belonged to the same party, he gave space to everyone,\u201d said retired Calcutta University professor Jagdishwar Chaturvedi, who had known the CPM leader since 1977 and was five years junior to him in JNU where they both studied. Yechury, 72, died at AIIMS in New Delhi on Thursday. The professor brought up the JNU anecdote to point to Yechury\u2019s accommodative spirit and said that one does not come across such an attribute among most Left politicians these days. Speaking about his first association with Yechury, Chaturvedi, who retired from the Hindi department of Calcutta University in 2017, and has since shifted to New Delhi, said: \u201cI was the Mathura district unit general secretary of the SFI when Sita was already a name in the students\u2019 movement in the country. It was during the emergency that we came to know each other.\u201d  Chaturvedi, who was always in touch with his leader and friend from the JNU days, said the CPM general secretary was \u201cso passionate about students\u2019 and youth movement that he never forgot his roots. \u201cEven till a few years ago, Sita would frequent the campus and showed how he loved his roots. He did not forget the varsity that churned a leader out of him. Such was his love for his political roots,\u201d the professor said.   Almost echoing Chaturvedi, another JNU-ite and socialist Surajit Mukhopadhyay recalled his memories about \u201cSita\u201d. \u201cI heard him speak several times at JNU and once in Calcutta. I was impressed by his soft persuasive gentle arguments. One could talk to him on a wide range of issues. That fascinated me as a young student. He symbolised the very essence of JNU. Reason, reading, arguments and engagement with the matter both empirically and theoretically,\u201d Mukhopadhyay said.  He added that Yechury\u2019s death would leave a huge vacuum in the country\u2019s Left movement as well as against the consolidated fight against communal forces in India. ",

        "Article Content": "Union tribal minister Jual Oram has sent a letter to BJP MP from Sikkim Dorjee Tshering Lepcha, saying the Registrar General of India (RGI) hasn\u2019t considered the Sikkim government\u2019s proposal to grant tribal status to 12 communities in the Himalayan state.  In the Darjeeling hills also, there is a longstanding demand to accord Scheduled Tribe (ST) status to 11 Gorkha communities \u2014 Kirat/Khambu/Rai, Gurung, Mangar, Thami, Sanyasi (Jogi), Bahun, Chhetri, Bhujel, Kirat/Dewan, Sunuwar and Newar.  The 12th community for which the ST status is proposed is Majhis of Sikkim.  The content of the letter dated September 10 aligns with the communication that residents and leaders of Darjeeling have been receiving for the past couple of years. Oram has told the Rajya Sabha member that \u201caccording to the prescribed modalities, proposals recommended and justified by the state government/UT can be processed and the same has to be concurred with the RGI and the National Commission for Schedule Tribes (NCST) for consideration for amendment of legislation to grant the status\u201d. \u201cRGI has replied that the issue has already been examined by them and not considered for recommendation,\u201d read the letter. With regard to the Majhi community, the minister said \u201cno proposal is received by this Ministry from the Government of Sikkim\u201d. Oram said the comments of the RGI had been sent to the Sikkim government for \u201cjustification\u201d. The BJP had promised to grant tribal status to the 12 communities in 2014 and the same was included in the party\u2019s 2019 Lok Sabha election manifesto. In its reply to a query under the RTI, the RGI had said it couldn\u2019t pursue the Bengal government\u2019s recommendation to the Centre in 2014 to grant the ST status to the 11 Gorkha communities. The RTI reply triggered charges that the Bengal government\u2019s recommendation wasn\u2019t watertight. \u201cNow that Sikkim\u2019s proposal has met the same fate, it has raised questions on whether this demand will ever be met by the Centre,\u201d said an observer from Darjeeling. Darjeeling BJP MP Raju Bista, however, allayed such fears. \u201cThis is a standard reply that bureaucrats prepare. The demand will be fulfilled by political will and we are confident about it,\u201d said Bista. Three committees had been formed by the Centre since 2016 to look into the Bengal government\u2019s proposal to grant tribal status to the 11 communities.  The final report compiled in 2019 by a team headed by M.R. Tshering, joint secretary, ministry of tribal affairs, put the ball in the court of the office of the RGI.  The Telegraph had earlier highlighted a letter written by the additional registrar general in the office of the RGI to the joint secretary in the ministry of tribal affairs on March 24, 2017. The letter said, \u201cinflow of Nepalese immigrants will further increase if the said communities are granted ST status\u201d. The letter further observed: \u201cThe consequences of specifying all these (Gorkha ) communities as STs will be that almost all the permanent residents of Sikkim will be Scheduled Tribes, and the more backward communities like Lepcha and Bhutia (who are ST) would be disadvantaged and deprived.\u201d The fact that members of many of the communities seeking the tribal status are Hindus was also seen as a stumbling block to the fulfilment of the demand.

If the balance is skewed as it happened in Kolkata, women have to take Maa Kali\u2019s form to ensure their own safety,\u201d said Rathod.    \tThe unique eco-friendly idol will be immersed in milk on Anant Chaturdashi (September 17), which marks the end of the 10-day Ganesh festival.    \tThe chocolate-laced milk will be distributed to underprivileged children, she added.

They\u2019ve already suffered a setback, with Ibrahim Zadran ruled out after sustaining an ankle sprain after slipping on the wet outfield on match eve. Menhajuddin Naz, the international cricket manager at Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB), stated that they were offered three venues \u2014 Kanpur, Bengaluru, and Greater Noida \u2014 by the BCCI. They opted for Greater Noida due to its better connectivity with Kabul \u2014 the ground is a two-hour drive from New Delhi International Airport. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) cannot wash its hands off the entire mess though the Greater Noida Authority is supposed to provide all the facilities at the stadium. For the record, the BCCI hasn\u2019t hosted any domestic games here since 2019. None of the BCCI office-bearers were available for comment. A senior BCCI official though claimed that the ACB was made aware of the poor drainage facilities when the venue was allotted the Test. ",

        "Article Content": "Forty years old, but still going strong, that\u2019s Anustup Majumdar.  Not just that, the batter has been chosen as the best cricketer for the 2023-24 season by the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and will be feted at the association\u2019s annual awards function on Saturday. In the twilight of his career, Anustup remains Bengal\u2019s go-to batsman when the chips are down. Given the frequent collapses of the Bengal batting order, Anustup seems familiar with the immense responsibility he needs to shoulder, especially during Ranji Trophy games.  But the senior player, who has also played for India \u2018A\u2019 in the past, has no complaints. \u201cI enjoy it quite a bit,\u201d was how Anustup put it. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many capable people not eager or willing to take responsibility, not just in cricket but in other fields too. They don\u2019t want to take the blame. But I love taking responsibility. \u201cPressure will always be there, but I don\u2019t let thoughts of failure creep into my mind.\u201d  Still, by far better in terms of technique than almost everyone else in the current Bengal batting group, Anustup is undecided about how much longer he wishes to continue. \u201cBut yeah, I wish to play for another year at least following this season,\u201d he said.  Last season he was the highest run-getter for Bengal in both Ranji and the Vijay Hazare Trophy (510 and 319 runs, respectively). This time around too, Anustup will adopt the same model of giving \u201cutmost priority to fitness and 100 per cent even in training sessions\u201d as his work ethics boosts the Bengal  team management.  Having said that, the lack of young batsmen with standout performances worries him. \u201cManoj (Tiwary), Wriddhiman (Saha) and I have all come from the U-19 level. But at present, there are not enough good players in the U-19 team,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who can push for a place in the senior squad, especially from the batting point of view, just aren\u2019t there. Abishek Porel and Sudip Gharami have done well, but they still have some distance to cover. In fact, in our team, the opening combination is one area that has to be sorted.\u201d Anustup added: \u201cEven performance-review meetings don\u2019t really happen. At least I haven\u2019t come across them at both senior and junior levels. Reviewing the last season, areas where we are lagging... these are necessary. Maybe infrastructure-wise, we need to effect gradual changes.\u201d  There could be some relief for Anustup and his batting colleagues in the initial stage of the Ranji Trophy as Mohammed Shami will most likely feature in two matches for Bengal this season. The senior India pacer is still at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru, working hard to get back to full-intensity bowling. \u201cIn all probability, Shami will be playing our first two games. And if not so, it could be the second and third matches,\u201d a CAB official said.",

        "Article Content": "Australian spinner Nathan Lyon has identified Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Rishabh Pant as the three \u201cbig ones\u201d to watch out for in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series. The five-Test series between India and Australia gets underway on November 22 in Perth. Besides the big ones, Lyon has also warned that the visitors have an \u2018amazing line-up\u2019, making things massively challenging for the hosts. \u201cRohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Rishabh Pant are probably going to be the three really big ones. But then, you\u2019ve still got (Yashasvi) Jaiswal, Shubman Gill, (Ravindra) Jadeja, and who else will come out \u2014 another five, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d he told Star Sports. However, Lyon was confident that if the Australians delivered as a bowling unit over an extended period, it would be beneficial for them. \u201cBut, it\u2019s a pretty amazing line-up they\u2019ve got, so it\u2019s going to be a massive challenge. As I said, if we, as a bowling group, are good enough for long periods, hopefully, we can challenge their defence,\u201d he added. The Aussies have failed to win the title since their last series victory in 2014-15 at home. The Indians have won the title on four consecutive instances since then, winning twice each at home and away, a record for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. They also became the only Asian team to win a Test series in Australia, and also on multiple occasions.",

        "Article Content": "The third days action between Afghanistan and New Zealand was called off at the Greater Noida Sports Complex ground a little after 9 am on Wednesday following persistent rain and overnight showers A damp outfield was the primary reason for the first two days of the one-off Test to be abandoned though there was no significant downpour The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) said in a statement that the BCCI has been assisting them by providing \"additional machinery\" to make \"conditions ideal\" for the match to start The outfield is not sandbased, so rain takes longer to dissipate from the surface and for the ground to dry at the venue. The BCCI made some last-minute effort by arranging for the Kotla curator, Ankit Dutta, to travel from Delhi and assist the groundsmen at Greater Noida An extra super sopper was also arranged, but that didn t make any difference. The ACB also told the media that they tried to move the Test to another venue, but at such a short notice, it was not possible The ACB, the home team for this match, was offered stadiums in Kanpur and Bengaluru but they chose the one at Greater Noida due to logistical reasons \"It was a two-hour drive from Delhi airport,\" ACB s international cricket manager Menhajuddin Raz said on Tuesday The manager sent out a message to the media on the third morning that \"there is no blame game at all from anyone, it s just extremely bad luck\" The BCCI though cannot wash its hands off since it was their decision to offer Greater Noida as an option to the ACB. A venue which meets international standards like the PCA Stadium in Mohali or the newly-built Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in Mullanpur, which hosted IPL matches this year, could have been offered as options instead At a time when Test cricket is threatened by the onset of the T20 format and franchise leagues, this has hardly been the right way to promote the game. It is bound to send the wrong signals when it comes to improving the popularity of Test matches Only a small part of the ground at Greater Noida could be protected from bad weather -- the main square, along with some adjoining areas -- and lack of adequate covers aggravated the underfoot conditions Afghanistan opener Ibrahim Zadran slipped during practice on the eve of the match, twisted his ankle and was ruled out of the Test. Thankfully, the ACB doesn t wish to complain against such sub-standard facilities especially keeping the greater picture in mind \"Look, the venue is an international standard venue,\" Raz had said after the second day. \"It has hosted around 12 (11) games internationally. It s not like it s a new venue. It s just the rain which has affected everything. And that s the only reason we re not having a game...\"  This Test is not part of the ICC s World Test Championship. The ICC doesn t need to get involved directly other than appointing match officials though match referee Javagal Srinath s report could decide the fate of the venue.  The outfield looks less than promising heading into the fourth day though both teams will be hoping to get some match practice, particularly New Zealand who are due to play back-to-back Tests in the subcontinent -- against Sri Lanka in September and then India in October.",

The Economic Impact Assessment, conducted by Nielsen for the International Cricket Council, claimed that the mega-event held in October-November last year was the biggest ever ODI World Cup. \u201cThe ICC Men\u2019s Cricket World Cup 2023 has demonstrated the significant  economic power of cricket, generating economic benefit of US$ 1.39 billion (Rs 11,637 crore) for India,\u201d ICC chief executive Geoff Allardice said in a statement. Australia ended India\u2019s unbeaten run in the tournament to win the trophy for a record sixth time on November 19. \u201cThe impact of tourism across the host cities amounted to US$ 861.4 million of revenue generation, through accommodation, travel, transportation and food and beverage because of a massive influx of domestic and foreign tourists attending the matches,\u201d read an ICC statement. \u201cThe secondary and incremental spends within the economy was a key driver, generating US$ 515.7 million, which was approximately 37 per cent of the total impact.\u201d The ICC did not specify, however, whether the massive figure cited in the report is actual revenue. A record-breaking 1.25 million spectators attended the mega event, of which nearly 75 per cent were attending an ICC 50-over match for the first time ever, the report claimed. \u201cNearly 55 per cent of the international respondents had previously visited India regularly, whilst an injection of new visitors thanks to  the World Cup saw 19 per cent of international attendees making their first ever visit to the country. \u201cInternational travellers visited multiple tourist destinations during their stay which amounted to an economic impact of US$ 281.2 million and nearly 68 per cent of international attendees said that they would recommend India as a tourist destination to friends and family in the future further enhancing India\u2019s global image.\u201d  Over 48,000 full and part-time jobs were created through direct involvement  as well. \u201cThe event created thousands of jobs and showcased India as a premier tourist destination, proving that ICC events not only engage fans passionately but also contribute significantly to the economies of our host nations,\u201d Allardice said.",

        "Article Content": "Bangladesh on Thursday named uncapped wicketkeeper batter Jaker Ali in place of injured pacer Shoriful Islam in the squad for the two-Test series in India beginning later this month.  The Tigers will be without the services of left arm-pacer Shoriful, who has been nursing a groin injury since the opening Test in Pakistan last month.  Shoriful's absence is the sole change from the 16-man squad that travelled to Pakistan, where Bangladesh recorded a historic 2-0 series victory.  Instead of going for a like-for-like replacement for Shoriful, the selectors have handed a maiden Test call up to Jaker, who has represented Bangladesh in 17 T20 Internationals, debuting during the Asian Games last year.  He has played 49 first-class games, collecting 2,862 runs at an average of 41.47, including four centuries and 19 half-centuries.  Mahmudul Hasan Joy, who also suffered a groin niggle during the Pakistan tour, has retained his spot.  The Test series starts on September 19 in Chennai, followed by the final Test in Kanpur on September 27.  The two match-series is a part of the ongoing World Test Championship cycle.  India and Australia occupy the top two spots in the WTC table currently, while Bangladesh is lurking in fourth place.  Bangladesh squad for India Tests: Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Shadman Islam, Zakir Hasan (wk), Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Shakib Al Hasan, Litton Das (wk), Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Jaker Ali (wk), Taskin Ahmed, Hasan Mahmud, Nahid Rana, Taijul Islam, Mahmudul Hasan Joy, Nayeem Hasan and Khaled Ahmed.

        "Article Content": "The focus will be on the likes of Rinku Singh, India B teammate Musheer Khan and India C left-arm spinner Manav Suthar in Round II of the Duleep Trophy beginning in Anantapur on Thursday. The star power in the season-opening red-ball event will be reduced significantly from this round as the Team India squad members are getting ready for the first Test against Bangladesh in Chennai from next Thursday. Sarfaraz Khan is the lone India squad member who will feature in this domestic competition. But one eagerly waits to see how KKR player Rinku, who was not picked for the first round despite having an impressive first-class record for Uttar Pradesh, fares in  this clash for India B at the Rural Development Trust Stadium B ground in Anantapur. The spirited left-hander has already proved his mettle in T20 cricket. Talking about Musheer, his 181 in the first innings for India B against India A in Bengaluru had impressed one and all. That innings, which he played braving a very tough situation, has almost confirmed him of a place for an \u2018A\u2019 tour when it happens next. Musheer, Sarfaraz\u2019s brother, couldn\u2019t open his account in the second innings of the first-round game. So on this occasion, the talented young batter needs to be extra cautious about getting a score that carries an impact for his side. This impact is what the national selectors value very much.  Sarfaraz will also be eyeing a big knock before he joins up with the India squad in Chennai. Fresh off his seven-wicket haul in the previous game, Suthar should be going into this round with a lot more confidence and trust in his abilities. If he continues with game-turning spells in the coming days too, the left-arm spinner should be making an even louder appeal to the selectors.  Shubman Gill joining the national team has led to Mayank Agarwal captaining the India A unit against India D in the other game. Having played his last Test in March 2022, Agarwal needs a bagful of runs to get back into the national reckoning. Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh also needs to do a lot more to enhance his red-ball credentials.",

Head banged four sixes and eight fours in an explosive innings of 59 as Australia raced to 86/0 in 5.5 overs. Opener Matthew Short also struck two sixes in his knock of 41. But Australia, having reached the halfway point on 118/2, were pegged back by England\u2019s spinners to end on 179. Having gained momentum after taking 10 Australian wickets for just 93, England were unable to carry it into their innings and were never really in the hunt. Featuring T20I debutants Jordan Cox, Jacob Bethell and Jamie Overton and captained by Phil Salt in the absence of an injured Jos Buttler, England slumped to 52/4 as wickets fell at regular intervals on a chilly evening. Sean Abbott took three wickets, while Josh Hazlewood and Adam Zampa scalped two apiece as England were all out for 151. Earlier, Head took a couple of overs to get his eye in but then let rip in spectacular fashion as Australia cashed in during the Powerplay to leave England gasping for breath. Sam Curran came in for some fearsome punishment in the fifth over as Head began with successive fours before thumping a hat-trick of sixes and finishing it by carving another boundary. Head was eventually out, top-edging Saqib Mahmood to the deep square leg boundary, where Cox pouched the catch. \u201cI was trying to acclimatise to a wicket with pace, hitting good shots while Shorty also got a cracking start,\u201d Head said. \u201cA bit of a luck, but I\u2019ve worked hard to play with a freer mindset.\u201d Following Head\u2019s dismissal, captain Mitchell Marsh was bowled by Adil Rashid for two, but with Short also in attack mode, Australia were poised for a huge score. Short departed in the 11th over though, top-edging a slog sweep off the bowling of Liam Livingstone with Curran taking a well-judged catch, and the wheels began to fall off. Livingstone had Marcus Stoinis and Tim David trapped lbw in successive deliveries as Australia slumped to 132/5.  Australia 179 in 19.3 ovs (Travis Head 59; Liam Livingstone 3/22). England 151 in 19.2 ovs (Liam Livingstone 37; Sean Abbott 3/28). Australia won by 28 runs.",

Kishan\u2019s 111 (126b, 14x4, 3x6) lifted India C from a slightly wobbly 97/2 after they lost Rajat Patidar (40) and B. Sai Sudharsan (43) in quick succession. The innings also underlined the fitness of the 26-year-old, who was originally in India D squad, as he missed the first round of Duleep Trophy with a groin injury. Sanju Samson was drafted in as Kishan\u2019s replacement in India D squad, necessitating the redrafting of the former into India C. India C\u2019s situation on Thursday was compounded by skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad\u2019s return to the hut with an ankle niggle after facing just two balls. However, any majorconcern over Gaikwad\u2019s fitness was allayed when he came out to bat after Kishan\u2019s dismissal, making an unbeaten 46 (50b, 7x4, 2x6) to guard the crease along with Manav Suthar (8 batting). Kishan had made a hundred in Jharkhand\u2019s opening round win over Madhya Pradesh in the recently concluded Buchi Babu Invitational tournament in Tamil Nadu. Kishan on Thursday had Baba Indrajith (78, 136b, 9x4) for company as the pair milked 189 runs for the third wicket. Kishan played late and clo\u00adse to his body to nip the early movement. He got 10 boundaries through square and fine-leg regions. The left-hander was not hesitant to flex his muscles whenever there was an opportunity. He hammered Navdeep Saini for two sixes in the fine leg region and once also lifted Mukesh Kumar over the mid-wicket boundary. Bowling all-rounder Shams Mulani stood on the cusp of his maiden first-class hundred after leading India A\u2019s remarkable recovery to steer them to 288/8 on the opening day of their match against India D. Mulani (88 not out off 174) forged a 91-run stand with Tanu\u00adsh Kotian (53 off 80) to save the day for India A, who were reduced to 93/5 inside the first session. Kumar Kushagra (28 off 66) too provided some much-needed support to Mulani, who collected eight fours and three sixes in his unbeaten effort. The southpaw would be aiming to surpass his highest score of 97 on Friday. Mulani, whose mainly plays as a spinner, effectively used his feet against the slow bowlers, especially against left-armer Saurabh Kumar. Against the quicker bowlers, his play square of the wicket stood out. For India D, pacers Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh and Vidwath Kaverappa got two wickets each.   357/5 (Ishan Kishan 111, Baba Indrajith 78, Ruturaj Gaikwad 46 batting; Mukesh Kumar 3/76) vs India B  288/8 (Shams Mulani 88 batting, Tanush Kotian 53; Harshit Rana 2/49, Vidhwath Kaverappa 2/30, Arshdeep Singh 2/73) vs India D With inputs from PTI",

        "Article Content": "Yuzvendra Chahal is not in India\u2019s Test squad for the upcoming series against Bangladesh, but the leg-spinner is in superb red-ball form.  Chahal claimed career-best match figures of 9/99 to earn Northamptonshire their first County Championship victory of the season, defeating Derbyshire by 133 runs. Chahal followed up his five-wicket haul in the first innings with a 4/54 in the second to demolish Derbyshire, who were shot out for just 132. Northamptonshire\u2019s scores in the match were 219 and 211, while Derbyshire managed just 165 in their first innings.   Chahal hunted down the ri\u00adval batters along with off-spinner Rob Keogh, who took 5/44 in the second innings and had a match haul of 8/110.  Keogh was all praise for the Indian tweaker. \u201cWe call him the magician. He\u2019s got a bag of tricks and luckily it was too cold for him to get all of them out! He said he just stuck to the flipper a few times and that got him some wickets,\u201d Keogh was quoted as saying by the Northamptonshire Chronicle. \u201cI think it helps me, not only his cricket brain, he kn\u00adows spin bowling, but it takes the pressure off me at the other end and I feel like I can just bowl and not worry about going for too many runs... I\u2019ve been lucky enough to bowl with some great spinners, but he\u2019s (Chahal) got to be up there,\u201d Keogh added. During the match, Chahal also completed a personal milestone of 100 first-class wickets. Bangladesh spinner Shakib Al Hasan too is busy playing in the County Championship. All-rounder Shakib claimed 5/96 in the second innings for Surrey against Somerset. Like Chahal, Shakib toohad a nine-wicket (9/197) match haul. Shakib will hope to carry on with the form in the upcoming Tests against India.  ",

        "Article Content": "Bangladesh have included uncapped batter Jaker Ali in place of fast bowler Shoriful Islam for the upcoming tour of India. The 23-year-old pacer had suffered a groin injury during the first Test against Pakistan and wasn\u2019t available for the second match. Taskin Ahmed, Nahid Rana, Hasan Mahmud and Khaled Ahmed make up Bangladesh\u2019s pace attack in Shoriful\u2019s absence. The Bangladesh think-tank is optimistic of Shoriful\u2019s availability for the T20I leg of the India tour. \u201cShoriful can\u2019t be considered fully fit at the moment. He was unfit during the second Test in Pakistan, which is why he wasn\u2019t part of the selection process. \u201cHe missed the second Test against Pakistan due to his injury. The physios and trainers are looking after him. He remains within the system. He is an important member  of our white-ball team. We have a T20 series coming up against India,\u201d said national selector Hannan Sarkar in Dhaka on Thursday. The squad, led by Najmul Hossain Shanto, will reach Chennai on Sunday.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call Shoriful 100 per cent fit for Tests because a Test match may require him to bowl 15-20 overs. \u201cGiven that he\u2019s not fully fit yet, we\u2019re not willing to take any risks. We have other fully fit players in the Test squad who can compete. Therefore, we chose not to take a risk with Shoriful, but hopefully, he will recover in time and return to the T20 squad.\u201d Instead of adding another fast bowler as replacement, the selectors have opted  to blood in wicket-keeper batter Ali.",

        "Article Content": "Almost a month after new head coach Gautam Gambhir began his stint with the limited-overs series in Sri Lanka, Team India will commence their task of maintaining their position at the top of the World Test Championship table when they take on Bangladesh in the opening match of the two-match series in Chennai from September 19. In the lead-up to the tougher battles ahead, the players will go through a conditioning camp at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai from Friday. It is understood that most of the players, including ca\u00adptain Rohit Sharma, rea\u00adc\u00adhed Chennai on Thursday evening. Virat Kohli is expected to arrive on Friday. India\u2019s last Test series was against England at home in January-February. The team will be playing 10 Tests, including five at home \u2014 two versus Bangladesh and three against New Zealand next month \u2014 before travelling Down Under for the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The camp will be an opportunity for the Gambhir-led support staff to formulate the team\u2019s strategy and gameplan. The batters\u2019 weakness ag\u00adainst quality spin was exposed during the 0-2 ODI series loss in Sri Lanka and the think-tank will be looking to address these concerns. The Bangladesh spin duo of Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Shakib Al Hasan could pose quite a threat in the slow and low conditions and Gambhir won\u2019t be willing to leave anything to chance. The Indian top-order, including the likes of Rohit, Kohli and KL Rahul, have consistently struggled against the spinners and it could have huge implications against Nathan Lyon in Australia. The camp will be a good platform to sort out this issue. Promising Mumbai off-spinner Himanshu Singh has also been asked to join the camp at the behest of chief selector Ajit Agarkar. The composition of the middle-order will also be of importance. While Rohit and Yashasvi Jaiswal are set to open the innings, Shubman Gill will occupy the No.3 position followed by Kohli. The No.5 position, however, is up for grabs. As of now, Rahul is the favourite though Sarfaraz Khan had batted successfully in the series against England. That Sarfaraz has been allowed to play the ongoing Duleep Trophy match for India B against India C is perhaps an indication that Rahul will be the team managem\u00adent\u2019s first choice in the playing XI in Chennai. Rahul hasn\u2019t looked very comfortable in the lone Duleep outing and it will be a huge challenge for him to seal his place since he will be needed on the bouncy surfaces  in Australia. Bowling coach Morne Morkel will also link up with the squad during the camp and will get to closely have a look at the unit, which includes the promising Akash Deep and left-arm pacer Yash Dayal. The need to manage the workload of Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj in the five home Tests was considered during the selection meeting. With three spinners likely to make the XI at home, the selectors will play only one among Bumrah and Siraj wh\u00adile trying out new faces like Akash Deep or Dayal. Striking the right balance in the XI will be of great importance and the camp will look to make the most of the conditions on offer.",

        "Article Content": "Afghanistan \u201cbarely play a Test or two\u201d a year. On top of that, there has been no play on the first four days of their one-off Test against New Zealand at the Greater Noida Sports Complex ground because of persistent rain and poor ground conditions.  Such a situation, though, would not have arisen had the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) not gone ahead in selecting Greater Noida as the venue for the one-off Test against the Black Caps, feels Afghanistan assistant coach Raees Ahmadzai.  It was also learnt that the assistant coach has sent a written communication on the matter to the Afghan Board, but has got no response yet from the latter.  \u201cEven our head coach (Jonathan Trott) is extremely disappointed with how things have panned out. Our cricketers badly need some Test cricket experience as we play barely a Test match or two a year. This was an occasion when we had an opportunity to play a Test against a strong team and it would certainly have been an experience for our players and helped them to learn.  \u201cWe even spend a fair amount of money on our first-class cricket. Not even having a ball bowled on all four days, everything goes for a toss. The entire effort and time is wasted, which is extremely frustrating,\u201d a disappointed Ahmadzai, currently working with Afghanistan\u2019s white-ball specialists \u2014 getting ready for the upcoming ODI series against South Africa at Sharjah \u2014 and emerging players, told  \u201cWe should never play at this ground again. I doubt if this is an international standard venue at all,\u201d the assistant coach added.  Since the outfield at the Greater Noida ground isn\u2019t sand-based, it takes longer to dry the surface when there\u2019s so much rain. The BCCI had made some last-minute effort by arranging for Kotla curator Ankit Dutta\u2019s travel from New Delhi to assist the Greater Noida groundsmen. An extra super sopper was also arranged, but that made no difference. Then, showers from late at night on Wednesday made matters worse, leading to a washout on Day IV as well. The ACB, the home team for this one-off Test, was also offered Kanpur and Bengaluru as alternative venues. However, the Afghan Board chose the Greater Noida one due to logistical reasons. \u201cIt was a two-hour drive from the Delhi airport,\u201d the ACB\u2019s international cricket manager Menhajuddin Raz had said earlier in the week.  Refusing to buy into that idea, Ahmadzai termed it a \u201cjoke\u201d. \u201cJust because of that (logistical reasons), you wanted to play there! Come on, is this a joke or what!\u201d he stated.  \u201cBengaluru, on any day, is a better venue than this one. Our players would gain some experience from playing there irrespective of the conditions.  \u201cBesides, it didn\u2019t matter even if the Test match got over in three days or so. What counts is our guys\u2019 learning experience and Test-cricket exposure playing against a strong team like New Zealand. It would have been a big boost to our cricketers if they could have stretched the Test till the fourth or fifth day. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when we are going to play a Test match next. And this was an opportunity we lost due to sheer wrong decision-making in terms of the venue selection. It\u2019s extremely disappointing,\u201d Ahmadzai rued.  According to team sources, the Afghan cricketers have shifted their focus now to the ODI series against the Proteas at Sharjah beginning on September 18. \u201cThe ones who will be joining the rest of the squad at Sharjah prefer not to dwell any longer on this Test as the final day too may not witness any action,\u201d an Afghanistan team source said. The source added that Afghanistan may select Lucknow as the venue for their home Tests going forward. ",

        "Article Content": "The Pakistan Cricket Board has allocated 12.8 billion rupees for the renovation of stadiums in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi ahead of next year\u2019s ICC Champions Trophy, informed PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi. In a briefing given at the Board of Governors meeting in Faisalabad, Naqvi assured that the three venues would be ready in time to host the marquee event. Giving details of the fund distribution, Naqvi said 7.7 billion rupees out of 12.8 billion are being spent on the upgradation of the Gaddafi stadium in Lahore. The allocated budget for Gaddafi stadium involves 1,100 million rupees for the construction of a steel-structured pavilion, 3,471 million rupees for a concrete office building, 1,250 million rupees for the steel structure of the enclosure, 189 million rupees for a moat, and 330 million rupees for the replacement of two LED digital screens. The board is also replacing floodlights with 480 LED lights at Gaddafi Stadium at a cost 523 million rupees, while 375 million rupees have been allocated for the installation of seats, and 93 million rupees for external development works. The PCB has earmarked 3.5 billion rupees for renovating the National Stadium in Karachi including the new construction. This includes 1,500 million rupees for the steel structure of the pavilion building, 580 million rupees for renovating the main building and hospitality boxes, 330 million rupees for two new LED digital screens, 490 million rupees for replacing floodlights with 450 LED lights, and 340 million rupees for seat installation. The construction work at Pindi Stadium is estimated to cost 1.5 billion rupees including 393 million rupees for replacing floodlights with 350 LED lights and 400 million rupees for renovating the main building, hospitality boxes, and restrooms. Additionally, 330 million rupees have been allocated for replacing two LED digital screens, and 272 million rupees will be spent on new seating installations.",

        "Article Content": "Afghanistan's one-off test against New Zealand became just the eighth match in the format's history to be abandoned without a ball being bowled after rain washed out the fifth and final day in India's Greater Noida region on Friday. The first ever test scheduled between the sides looked doomed from the start due to steady rain for more than two weeks in the region. It was also the first test to be scheduled at the Shahid Vijay Singh Pathik Sport Complex near Delhi. Afghanistan play their home matches abroad due to security concerns for touring teams. The Afghan board preferred Greater Noida over two other venues in India because of its proximity to Delhi, which made travelling from Kabul easier. \"We're disappointed. We'd geared ourselves up, and we'd trained really well,\" Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott told reporters. \"What I hope it is a good learning case that things can crop up... everything has got to be checked out and made sure that it's ready for test-match cricket. \"I think the ground staff have worked, obviously, very hard here. It just unfortunately hasn't materialised, and we've had a freakish amount of rain for this time of year.\" New Zealand coach Gary Stead was frustrated after they were denied an opportunity to get used to the sub-continent's conditions ahead of a busy schedule that includes five more tests in Asia in the next two months. \"The most disappointing part for us is that we lost the opportunity to be match-hardened and match-ready when we go into our test match (against Sri Lanka) next week,\" Stead said. \"The guys are really disappointed. It was an opportunity to play Afghanistan. It doesn't come around that often.\" New Zealand will fly to Sri Lanka on Saturday for a two-test series in Galle from September 18.",

        "Article Content": "The Madhya Pradesh Congress on Friday alleged that some BJP workers and their relatives were behind the incident of assault on two army officers and rape of their woman friend near Indore's Mhow. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, rubbished the allegation and accused the opposition party of creating a \"false perception\" on the issue. It also said the state government is very sensitive in such matters and that the accused in the Mhow case will not be able to escape. Two army officers were assaulted and one of their two women friends was allegedly raped in the wee hours of Wednesday near popular tourist spot Jam Gate, about 30 km from Mhow military cantonment. Police have arrested three of the six accused so far. Talking to reporters, MP Congress president Jitu Patwari said, \"It has been proven again that whenever incidents like rape and atrocities against women come to the fore, the names of BJP workers and leaders crop up. Behind the Mhow incident also, the names of BJP workers, their relatives and also the kin of other party leaders have cropped up.\"  \"What message does it give? It shows that there is a rule of mafia and rapists, and others are indulging in such acts without any fear of administration and government. As the names of BJP workers' relatives have cropped up in the Mhow incident, I want to ask (Chief Minister) Mohan Yadav - how is it possible that in your administration, party workers have got a free run to do anything?\" he said. In all such incidents against Dalits, adivasis (tribals) and women, why there are persons linked to the BJP behind, he asked, and termed Madhya Pradesh as the \"most unsafe state\" in the country. Refuting the allegations while talking to PTI Videos, state BJP chief V. D. Sharma said, \"Congress is trying to build a false perception on the issue. There is a BJP government in the state...If any predator or pervert is found involved in such crimes, then they must know that there is a government headed by Mohan Yadav in the state which is very sensitive. It will not spare any such person even for a second.\"  \"The BJP government has ensured that such persons are jailed and get capital punishment as per the law. They won't be able to escape,\" he said. Accusing the Congress of spreading lies, he said the BJP government was working sensitively in such matters. ",

        "Article Content": "Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai on Friday apologised for the action of his party functionaries in sharing on social media a video of a private conversation between a hotel chain owner in Coimbatore and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Barely minutes after the video went viral, the DMK, Congress and other netizens criticised the BJP for allegedly forcing a reputed hotelier to tender an apology for his remarks on Goods and Services Tax (GST) on September 12 in Coimbatore. In the controversial leaked video, Sri Annapoorna Restaurant owner Srinivasan could be heard saying to the Finance Minister that he was not affiliated to any party, before apologising. Only a day ago, he had raised the issue of GST at an event attended by Sitharaman in Coimbatore and had said \u201cthe problem is that GST is applied differently to each item. For instance, there is no GST on bun. But if you apply cream on it, the GST becomes 18 per cent.\u201d \tDue to this, customers, especially families, ask for bun and cream separately saying they will apply the cream on the bun themselves to save money, he had said. \"People say that the Finance Minister has levied 5 per cent GST on sweets and 12 per cent on namkeen because people eat a lot of sweets in the north and in Tamil Nadu, sweet, namkeen and coffee go together. Please charge uniform GST,\u201d Srinivasan had pleaded and jocularly said the computer was getting stuck because of this GST confusion. Sitharaman assured to consider it. Later, speaking to reporters she had said that he had raised an issue which ought to be considered by the GST council.  \tCoimbatore South MLA Vanathi Srinivasan who was present during the conservation, told media today that there was no need for the BJP to intimidate anybody. Amidst the criticism from several quarters, Annamalai said in a post on the social media platform X \u201cOn behalf of @BJP4TamilNadu, I sincerely apologise for the actions of our functionaries who shared a private conversation between a respected business owner and our Hon. FM.\u201d \t\u201cI spoke with Thiru Srinivasan Avl, the esteemed owner of the Annapoorna chain of Restaurants, to express regret for this unintended breach of privacy. Annapoorna Srinivasan Anna (elder brother) is a pillar of Tamil Nadu\u2019s business community, contributing significantly to the state\u2019s and nation\u2019s economic growth. I request everyone to lay the matter to rest with due respect,\u201d he said. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took strong exception to the incident and commented that the owner of a small business, like Annapoorna restaurant in Coimbatore, asked for a simplified GST regime, but his request was met with arrogance and outright disrespect. \u201cYet, when a billionaire friend seeks to bend the rules, change the laws, or acquire national assets, Modi Ji rolls out the red carpet. Our small business owners have already endured the blows of demonetisation, an inaccessible banking system, tax extortion and a disastrous GST. The last thing they deserve is further humiliation,\u201d he said in a post on X. Gandhi further said \u201cBut when the fragile egos of those in power are hurt, it seems humiliation is exactly what they\u2019ll deliver. MSMEs have been asking for relief for years. If this arrogant government would listen to the people they would understand that a simplified GST with a single tax rate would solve the problems of lakhs of businesses.\u201d \tDMK MP and party\u2019s deputy general secretary Kanimozhi cautioned the BJP-led government at the Centre and also the union ministers not to taunt the Tamils\u2019 self respect. She quoted a couplet from Thirukkural which said those who are humble remain great and the lowly praise themselves pompously. Condemning the \u201chumiliation\u201d of the third generation entrepreneur and an iconic personality of Coimbatore, AIADMK spokesperson Kovai Sathyan said in a post on X that the extraction of an apology showed the extent to which the BJP government was inebriated with power. \u201cThe peak of arrogance is a sign of destruction,\u201d he added.",

Hilton Convent School's principal Avnish Kumar Sharma has also been directed by the district Child Welfare Committee (CWC) to appear before even as the student's mother claimed her three children have stopped going to school out of fear and she may seek legal recourse. The incident first came to light on September 6 when a video of a heated argument between the principal and the boy's mother surfaced on social media platforms. The principal alleged that the boy, who hails from the Muslim community, used to make religious comments in school and brought non-veg food every day. A probe into the alleged misconduct by the principal found that the charges of him holding the student hostage and removing him from the institution were baseless. As the issue refused to die down, the NCPCR, the country's apex child rights body,   ordered the District Magistrate Rajesh Kumar Tyagi on Thursday to conduct a fresh probe on the issue and submit a report in 10 days. CWC Chairman Atulesh Kumar Bhardwaj also told media persons that the committee has taken suo motu cognisance of the incident under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. He emphasised the committee's authority to investigate harassment cases involving minor children and take appropriate action. Education department officials said the mother of the affected student has three children enrolled in the same school. \"What happened that day in the school has shaken all my children so much that they are now scared of even going to the school,\" the mother (name withheld to protect the identity of the minor student) told PTI. In the video, principal Sharma was seen claiming that the student had been making inappropriate comments to his classmates and was offering them non-vegetarian food, a charge refuted by the mother. She has also said she was not satisfied with the findings of the probe and suggested she intended legal recourse. \"I will move court to seek justice for my children,\" she said and denied claims that she had approached the district education department seeking a transfer of her children to a different school.

India shares a 4,096 kilometre-long international border with Bangladesh, including 2,217 km along West Bengal. Assam, Tripura, Mizoram and Meghalaya also share borders with that nation. Bangladesh is in the grip of political turmoil after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned on August 5 in the face of strident protests and fled to India. Nobel Laureate Mohammad Yunus is heading the government there presently. Following the unrest in Bangladesh, the BSF has enhanced its vigil along the international border to thwart attempts of illegal entry by citizens of that country into India. ",

During the question and answer session after his address to the Indian community, a member of the audience asked the Minister about his comments on the recently released series 'IC814: The Kandahar Hijack' on Netflix, which he said, showed \u201cthe bureaucracy and the government dealing with hijacking in poor light.\u201d \t With a disclaimer that he has not watched the series, Jaishankar went on to reveal his personal connection with the hijacking incident.  \u201cIn 1984 there was a hijacking. I was a very young officer. I was part of the team which was dealing with it. I rang up my mother, actually, to tell her, \u2018Look, I can't come. There's a hijacking,\u201d he said elaborating how it was his turn to go home and feed his young son as his wife too was working.  \u201cAnd then I discovered, my father was on the flight. The flight ended up in Dubai. It's a long story, but fortunately, nobody got killed. It could have ended as a problem,\u201d he added.  On July 5, 1984, an Indian Airlines flight was hijacked from Pathankot and taken to Dubai. After more than 36 hours, 12 pro-Khalistani hijackers surrendered to authorities and released all 68 passengers and six crew members unharmed.  Jaishankar was an IFS officer and became a minister after his retirement. His father K Subrahmanyam was an IAS officer and a regular commentator on strategic issues.  \u201cAnd it was interesting because on the one hand, I was part of the team which was working on the hijacking. On the other hand, I was part of the family members who are pressing the government for the hijacking. So actually, I have that very unique window on both sides, in that sense of the problem,\u201d he added.  \u201cSo, often these are situations and movie guys don't make the governments look good. The hero is supposed to look good. Then nobody would watch the movie and you got to accept that,\u201d he commented, evoking peals of laughter from the audience.",

        "Article Content": "The Dalit community and Republican Party of India would launch a nationwide -Jute Maro Andolan- against Rahul Gandhi for his remark on reservations, said Union Minister Ramdas Athawale on Friday.  Recently, during an interaction with the students of Georgetown University in the United States, the Leader of the Opposition, Rahul Gandhi told the students that the Congress would think of scrapping reservations when \"India is a fair place\", which he said is not the case currently.  Responding to a question regarding Gandhi's statement, Athawale, who is also the president of the Republican Party of India, said that no one can snatch the reservation of Dalits, OBC and Aadivasi and whoever attempts to do that would be dealt with.  \"The Dalit community and Republican Party of India would launch a nationwide -Jute Maro andolan- against the leader of the opposition Rahul Gandhi for his remark on reservation,\" he said and added that shoes should be thrown at Gandhi.  \"Rahul Gandhi is a useless man. Whenever he goes to England or America, he talks against India\", he said and advised Gandhi not to make wage statements.  He said, \"How is it possible that there is no democracy in the country? How can Rahul Gandhi get 99 seats and become the leader of the opposition if there is no democracy in the country?\" \t \"The people have given us a mandate and the NDA government is taking everyone ahead, he added.  Furthermore, in a post on X, Athawale said, \"By talking about ending #\u0906\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923  @RahulGandhi has once again brought the anti-Dalit face of Congress @INCIndia in front of the country. Dalits, tribals and backward classes of the country will teach Rahul a lesson on his statement of ending reservation. The reservation given by the respected Babasaheb Ambedkar through the Constitution will never end.\" \t Athawale was in Dharamshala to participate in the seminar organized by the World Cooperatives Economic Forum to discuss issues like connecting agriculture with cooperatives, the ongoing war scenario in context to Ukraine and Russia, Israel and Hamas and Pakistan's involvement in terrorist activities in India.",

        "Article Content": "National Conference leader Omar Abdullah on Friday asked Baramulla's Lok Sabha MP Sheikh Abdul Rashid to clarify whether his party would support the BJP if the saffron party needed it after the Jammu and Kashmir elections.  The Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) supremo, popularly known as Engineer Rashid, was behind bars in Delhi's Tihar Jail and was released on interim bail on Wednesday to campaign for the assembly elections.  \"Yesterday, at a seminar, when Rashid was asked whether he would support the BJP after the election, he remained silent. Why does he not say categorically that he will not support the BJP in any manner after the elections,\" Abdullah told reporters in Devsar area of south Kashmir's Anantnag district after an election rally. \"Engineer Rashid probably stated yesterday that if I am ready to go back to Delhi with him, he will leave the field in our favour. Today, I say that the day he has to go back to Tihar Jail, I will go with him to drop him there. He should leave the field and sit at home,\" the NC vice president added.  He said his party has talked about every issue related to the people of Jammu and Kashmir in their manifesto.  \"We (NC) have talked about Article 370. We have talked about the Kashmir issue. We have always talked about improving relations between India and Pakistan. And we have also talked about the day-to-day issues of the people here. What issue have we left?\" Abdullah asked.  Abdullah, who was defeated by Rashid in the Lok Sabha polls, said Jammu and Kashmir has faced a lot of \"losses because of the BJP\".  \"Whether it is Jammu or Kashmir, people everywhere are disappointed. To get rid from this disappointment and suffering, the BJP and those who are ready to help the BJP after October 8, must be defeated in this election.  This is the reason we have formed a pre-poll alliance to prove that we are the ones who are not ready to join hands with the BJP to form the government,\" he said.  According to Abdullah, other parties or candidates were in the election fray to help the BJP \"in some way or the other\".  \"We appeal to the voters to make the alliance candidates successful so as to get chance to save J-K from the BJP, and correct the injustices and exploitation that have taken place in the last 10 years,\" he added. Asked about the Supreme Court granting Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal bail in a CBI case, Abdullah said the people of Baramulla were told that they can get someone out of jail through their votes.  \"No one comes out through votes, they come out only through the court,\" the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said.",

        "Article Content": "The Delhi High Court on Friday granted interim bail till January 30 to four co-owners of the basement of an Old Rajinder Nagar coaching centre where three civil services aspirants drowned in July. Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma, while pronouncing the verdict on the bail pleas of the four accused, said the relief is subject to the co-owners depositing Rs 5 crore with the Red Cross. The judge said the conduct of the co-owners is \"unpardonable\" and an \"act of greed\". In the order, a request has been made to the Lieutenant Governor to constitute a committee under a retired high court judge to ensure no coaching centre is permitted to run without permission. The authorities should also carve out a place for coaching centres in the capital, Justice Sharma added. A detailed copy of the order is awaited. Three civil service aspirants -- Shreya Yadav (25) from Uttar Pradesh, Tanya Soni (25) from Telangana and Nevin Delvin (24) from Kerala -- died after the basement of the building housing Rau's IAS Study Circle was flooded following heavy rains in central Delhi's Old Rajinder Nagar on July 27. The co-owners of the basement -- Parvinder Singh, Tajinder Singh, Harvinder Singh and Sarbjit Singh -- sought bail on the grounds that they are merely the landlords of the basement which was let out on rental basis to the coaching centre and, therefore, they had no role whatsoever in the unfortunate event. The CBI has opposed the bail pleas and said the investigation was an initial stage and the accused should not be given the relief until independent witnesses are examined. The case, being probed under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), including section 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), was transferred from the Delhi Police to the CBI by the high court.",

        "Article Content": "The Supreme Court on Friday sought the response of the Centre and the Uttarakhand government on a plea moved by a girl, whose mother was allegedly raped and killed, seeking framing of guidelines on the protection of hospital staffers across the country. A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra was hearing the plea of the girl, who has moved the court through her maternal grandfather, alleging a delay and other procedural lapses on the part of the Uttarakhand Police in lodging an FIR in connection with the alleged rape and killing of her mother, who was employed with a hospital in the state. Besides seeking a direction to the Centre to frame guidelines on the protection of hospital staff regardless of their medical qualification, the plea has also sought an order \"to mandate a centralised alert in case a woman is reported to be missing and cannot be located within a reasonable time-frame\". The girl has sought an independent inquiry into the death and alleged sexual assault of her mother, who was working as an OPD assistant in the hospital. According to the plea, the victim went missing in the evening of July 30 and her partly-decomposed body was found on August 8 near her apartment in Rudrapur in Udham Singh Nagar. The plea has said police lodged a missing report and even the FIR belatedly, after a media outcry and an agitation. The FIR was registered on August 14. \"It is pertinent to mention here that even the post-mortem report failed to substantiate any specific cause for the death of the deceased and squarely covered the things on the basis that due to the advanced stage of decomposition, it is not possible to make any definite comment regarding the presence or absence of any skin or visceral injury, which may have individually or collectively caused the death or contributed to the cause of the death,\" it has said. The plea has said the minor is entitled to compensation under the Uttarakhand Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault Other Crimes, 2022 and yet no assistance has been provided to her or to her grandfather. It is clear that the investigation carried out by the local police is not reliable and an independent probe is needed, the plea has said. ",

        "Article Content": "Two Army personnel, including a junior commissioned officer (JCO), were killed and an equal number injured in an encounter with terrorists in the higher reaches of Jammu and Kashmir's Kishtwar district on Friday, officials said. The gunfight broke out when a joint security party of the Army and police, acting on a tip-off, launched a cordon-and-search operation in the Naidgham area in the Chhatroo belt connecting Kishtwar with south Kashmir's Anantnag district, they added. The officials said there was an exchange of fire between the search team of the security forces and the terrorists hiding in the Pingnal Dugadda forest area in the upper reaches of Naidgham village located within the Chhatroo police station limits. Four Army personnel were injured in the gunbattle and two of them -- Naib Subedar Vipan Kumar, a JCO, and Sepoy Arvind Singh -- later succumbed to their injuries, the officials said, adding that one of the soldiers died of splinter injuries caused by a grenade explosion and another of a bullet injury in the head. The Army also confirmed the killing of the two soldiers. \"GOC (General Officer Commanding) White Knight Corps and all ranks salute the supreme sacrifice of the bravehearts; offer deepest condolences to the families,\" the Army said. Earlier, the Army had said the search party exchanged a heavy volume of fire with the terrorists around 3:30 pm. \"In the ensuing firefight four army personnel have been injured. The operation is in progress,\" the Jammu-based White Knight Corps said in a post on X. The officials said the injured soldiers were airlifted to an Army hospital after preliminary treatment at a local hospital. The encounter comes two days after the Army, in a successful operation, neutralised two Pakistani terrorists affiliated with the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) outfit in the higher reaches of Basantgarh in Udhampur district. The Jammu and Kashmir unit of the Congress expressed grief over the killing of the two soldiers and prayed for a speedy recovery of the injured. \"The Congress strongly condemns the terrorist attack.... The BJP government has utterly failed to deal with terrorism, which has revived in the Jammu region after two decades,\" Pradesh Congress Committee vice-president Ravinder Sharma said in a statement. He said the government must take urgent measures to check terror attacks, instead of making \"hollow claims\" of normalcy.",

        "Article Content": "A court here has acquitted 10 men of various charges, including for unlawful assembly and arson, in a case regarding the 2020 northeast Delhi riots, saying it was not safe to rely upon the testimonies of three police witnesses. The court also observed that the \"artificiality of the claim\" made by the investigating officer (IO) and three police eyewitnesses created a doubt regarding their identification of the accused persons. Additional Sessions Judge Pulastya Pramachala was hearing the case against the 10 accused against whom the Gokalpuri police station had registered a case for several offences, including arson and lurking house trespass. According to the prosecution, the accused were part of a riotous mob that vandalised and torched a pizza shop on the ground floor, besides trespassing and committing robbery on the first floor of a building in the Chaman Park locality of Brijpuri here during the communal riots of February 24, 2020. Taking note of the evidence before it, the court, in its verdict pronounced on Wednesday, said two eyewitnesses in the case had taken \"contradictory stands\" about the shop being set on fire by a riotous mob and this dented their credibility. Taking note of the testimony of Head Constable Sanjay about being on duty with Constable Vipin and Assistant Sub-Inspector Hari Babu, the court said according to the duty roster for the day, Vipin and Babu were assigned duty at Chaman Park while Sanjay was assigned duty in Johripur. There was, however, no evidence to prove that Sanjay was directed to join the two other police officials, the court said. \"Thus, there is another gap in the evidence of the prosecution to give a contradictory picture. This gap goes on to adversely affect the credibility of the claims made by all aforesaid three eyewitnesses,\" it said. The court also noted the discrepancy in the statement of Inspector Manoj, the third investigating officer (IO) in the case, according to which, after reading the case file on April 8, 2020, he came to know that Sanjay, Vipin and Babu were on duty in the Brijpuri area. However, according to the evidence before it, the duty roster was not placed in the file when it was given to the IO on April 7, the court said. \"The question is that if the duty roster was not placed in the file, then how could he know about the duty of PW6 (Vipin), PW9 (Sanjay) and PW13 (Babu) on an analysis of the file? Thus, there appears to be an element of artificiality in such a claim,\" the judge said. \"I can understand that due to ongoing problems in the form of managing the after-effects of the riots and COVID-19, there could have been a delay in going ahead with the investigation. However, the artificiality of the claim is a different thing, which creates a doubt regarding the genuineness of the claim made by the IO and the aforesaid police eyewitnesses,\" he added. The court noted that the complainant, Narender Kumar, his wife Poonam Johar and eyewitness Shyam were declared hostile as they did not support the prosecution's case regarding identifying the accused. \"Thus, the overall effect remains that I find it unsafe to rely upon the evidence of PW6, PW9 and PW13 to believe that all the accused persons were part of the mob, which had attacked upon the property,\" the judge said, adding, \"I find that the charges levelled against all the accused persons are not proved beyond reasonable doubts.\" \tThe court acquitted the 10 accused -- Mohammed Shahnawaz, Mohammed Shoaib, Mohammed Faisal, Mohammed Tahir, Shahrukh, Rashid, Azad, Ashraf Ali, Parvez and Rashid -- of all charges.

        "Article Content": "Port Blair, the capital city of the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, has been renamed Sri Vijaya Puram, Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced on Friday. Shah said the decision was taken to free the nation from colonial imprints as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands had an \"unparalleled place\" in the country's freedom struggle and history. \"Inspired by the vision of Prime Minister @narendramodi ji, to free the nation from the colonial imprints, today we have decided to rename Port Blair as 'Sri Vijaya Puram',\" Shah said on X. While the earlier name had a colonial legacy, Sri Vijaya Puram symbolises the victory achieved in India's freedom struggle and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands' unique role in it, the home minister said. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands have an \"unparalleled place\" in the freedom struggle and history, and the island territory that once served as the naval base of the Chola Empire is now poised to be the critical base for India's strategic and development aspirations, he added. \"It is also the place that hosted the first unfurling of our Tiranga by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose ji and also the cellular jail in which Veer Savarkar ji and other freedom fighters struggled for an independent nation,\" Shah said. Being a Union Territory, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands come under the direct administrative control of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. The Andamans is world renowned for its pristine natural beauty, rich marine life, flora and fauna spread around 836 islands, islets and rocks. The islands present picturesque views with rich culture and heritage. The archipelago, located in the east of the Indian mainland geographically, floats in splendid isolation in the Bay of Bengal. Once a hill range extending from Myanmar to Indonesia, these picturesque undulating islands and islets are covered with dense rain-fed, damp and evergreen forests and endless varieties of exotic flora and fauna. Most of these islands (550) are in the Andaman Group, 28 of which are inhabited. The smaller Nicobars comprise some 22 main islands (10 inhabited). The Andaman and Nicobars are separated by the Ten Degree Channel, which is 150 kilometres wide, according to the Union Territory's tourism department. The archipelago has been inhabited for several thousand years, at the very least. Early archaeological evidence goes back some 2,200 years. However, indications from genetic, cultural and linguistic isolation studies point to habitation going back 30,000 to 60,000 years, well into the Middle Palaeolithic, according to the tourism department. In the Andaman Islands, the various Andamanese people maintained their separated existence through diversifying into distinct linguistic, cultural and territorial groups. In the 1850s, the indigenous people of Andamans first came into contact with the outside world. The local people are the Great Andamanese, who collectively represent at least 10 distinct sub groups and languages; the Jarawa: the jungle (or Rutland Jarawa); the Onge; and the Sentinelese (the most isolated of all the groups). The indigenous people of the Nicobars (unrelated to the Andamanese) have a similarly isolated and lengthy association with the islands. There are two main groups: the Nicobarese, or Nicobari living throughout many of the islands; and the Shompen, restricted to the interior of Great Nicobar.",

The locals and families of the victims are attributing the attacks to wolves, while forest department officials and wolf experts are suggesting that jackals or dogs may be responsible.  The recent attacks took place in the intervening night of Thursday and Friday. In one incident, Gudiya (26) was attacked by a wild animal while putting her daughter to sleep in Singiya Nasirpur village. The animal inflicted injuries to her neck and face, and she was subsequently admitted to the district hospital for treatment, the locals alleged.  Another attack occurred in Narkotwa village, where Nanakau (6) was injured by an unknown animal. In Sammanpurwa village, Mukimunnisha (45) was also attacked while going about her daily chores.  Locals have alleged that wolves are behind the three attacks. The forest department officials hold a different view.  Divisional Forest Officer Ajit Pratap Singh stated in an official statement that WII expert scientist Dr Shaheer Khan, who visited the scene of the incidents, did not find any evidence of wolf footprints but instead discovered footprints of jackals and dogs.  All the injured victims have been admitted to the district hospital and are receiving medical care, Singh said. Since July 17, the state government has launched an 'Operation Bhediya' to catch the wolves - five of which have already been rescued -  efforts are underway to find the sixth wolf from the pack, whose images were seen through a drone camera last month.  In Bahraich's Mahsi tehsil, 10 people, including nine children have been killed in these attacks since March and around three dozen people are left injured in human-wildlife conflicts in the area with the government declaring it as a \"wildlife disaster\".",

        "Article Content": "A court here on Friday extended till September 17 the judicial custody of Kannada actor Darshan Thoogudeepa along with his friend Pavithra Gowda and others, who are accused in the Renukaswamy murder case.       All the 17 accused, including Darshan and Pavithra, were produced before the 24th Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate court through video conferencing from various prisons across the state, where they are lodged, as their judicial custody ended today.       Police on September 4 had submitted to the court a 3,991-page preliminary chargesheet to the court in the case.        The 47-year-old actor is currently lodged in Ballari prison. He was shifted there from the Parappana Agrahara Central jail here by obtaining court permission, after a photograph of him hanging out with three others, including a rowdy-sheeter, on the lawns of the jail had gone viral, sparking an uproar.        In the picture, the actor is seen in a relaxed mood, sitting on a chair and holding a cigarette and a coffee mug. Also, a purported video of Darshan speaking to a person over a video call from the prison too had surfaced on social media.        The court had also permitted shifting of other co-accused in the murder case to various prisons in the state.       Other accused -- Pawan, Raghavendra and Nandish -- are now lodged in Mysuru, Jagadish and Lakshmana in  Shivamogga,  Dhanraj in Dharwad, Vinay in Vijayapura, Nagaraj in Kalaburagi/Gulbarga Jail, and Pradosh in Belagavi Jail.         Three accused -' Pavithra Gowda, Anukumar, and Deepak -- continue to remain at Parappana Agrahara Central Jail here. Four accused -- Ravi, Karthik, Nikhil and Keshavamurthy -- were earlier shifted to Tumakuru prison and they continue to remain lodged there.          Nine prison officials, including the Chief Superintendent of the Parappana Agrahara jail, were suspended over their \"lapses\" after a preliminary probe into \"special treatment\" to Darshan.           Also, three FIRs were registered, including against Darshan, under sections of the Prisons Act and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.         According to police sources, 33-year-old Renukaswamy, a fan of the actor, had sent obscene messages to Pavithra, which enraged Darshan, allegedly leading to his murder. His body was found near a stormwater drain next to an apartment in Sumanahalli here on June nine.        Raghavendra, one of the accused who is part of Darshan's fan club in Chitradurga, had brought Renukaswamy to a shed in R R Nagar here, on the pretext that the actor wanted to meet him. It was in this shed that he was allegedly tortured and murdered.         According to the post-mortem report, Renukaswamy, a native of Chitradurga,  died due to shock and haemorrhage as a result of multiple blunt injuries.         Police sources said Pavithra, who is accused number one, was the \"major cause\" for Renukaswamy\u2019s murder and claimed that it has been proved from the probe that she instigated other accused, conspired with them, and took part in the crime.

        "Article Content": "Gaza's economy has shrunk to less than a sixth of its size when the Israel-Hamas war began nearly a year ago, while unemployment in the occupied West Bank has nearly tripled, a U.N. report said on Thursday, underscoring the challenges of reconstruction. The report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) described Gaza's economy as \"in ruins\" more than 11 months after Israel launched a military campaign there that has reduced much of the Strip to rubble in response to the deadly Oct. 7 attacks on southern Israel by Hamas militants. The U.N. trade body said the Palestinian Authority (PA), which exercises limited self-rule under Israeli occupation in the West Bank, is under \"immense pressure\" that is jeopardising its ability to function. In addition to the economic slowdown caused by the conflict, falling international aid and revenue deductions and withholdings by Israel - which UNCTAD estimated at more than $1.4 billion since 2019 - are adding to the strain, it said. Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who ordered the funds to be withheld, accuses the PA of supporting the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The PA denies promoting violence. Israel also routinely deducts so-called \"martyr payments\" paid by the PA to families of militants and civilians killed by Israeli forces. UNCTAD called for \"immediate and substantial intervention by the international community to halt the economic freefall, address the humanitarian crisis, and lay the groundwork for lasting peace and development\". It also said there was a need for a comprehensive recovery plan. The document described \"a rapid and alarming economic decline\" in the occupied West Bank, which has suffered a surge in violence since the Gaza war. A total of more than 300,000 jobs have been lost in the West Bank since the war began, UNCTAD said, driving up the unemployment rate there from 12.9% to 32%. UNCTAD blamed the decline on the unrest, which the U.N. says has resulted in the deaths of more than 650 Palestinians since Oct. 7 as well as new Israeli trade restrictions such as checkpoints. Israel, which does not give Palestinian death tolls, says around 40 Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians outside Gaza since Oct. 7. It says its actions in the West Bank have been necessary to counter Iranian-backed militant groups and prevent harm to Israeli civilians. The war was triggered when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent assault on Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the enclave's health ministry. ",

        "Article Content": "Pakistan's central bank Thursday announced that it will cut the policy rate by 200 basis points (bps) to 17.5 per cent from 19.5 per cent amid a reduction in inflation. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) made the announcement in a statement after a meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which makes periodic adjustments in the interest rates. \"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the policy rate by 200 bps to 17.5 per cent in its meeting today,\u201d a statement released by the SBP read. It added that the committee took into \u201caccount various factors impacting the inflation outlook\u201d. The MPC \u201cassessed the real interest rate to still be adequately positive to bring inflation down to the medium-term target\u201d of 5 to 7 per cent and help ensure macroeconomic stability, according to the statement. The committee also noted that oil prices had fallen sharply and the SBP\u2019s foreign reserves stood at $9.5 billion on Sept 6. \u201cThird, secondary market yields of government securities have declined noticeably since the last MPC meeting,\u201d it said, adding that \u201cinflation expectations and confidence of businesses have improved in the latest pulse surveys, while those of consumers have worsened slightly\u201d. The decision on reduction had been keenly awaited after inflation in August was recorded at 9.6 per cent, a substantial improvement in terms of prices of essential commodities. The MPC noted that the decline in August \u201creflected the impact of contained demand, reinforced by improved supplies of major food items\u201d. The SBP in recent months began to bring down interest rates from 22 per cent by two successive cuts of 1.5 and 1 per cent. The reduction will help the industrial sector to borrow from banks at more reasonable rates and increase industrial output, which is essential to meet the 3.5 per cent annual growth target set by the government for fiscal 2024-25.",

        "Article Content": "A new round of cattiness emerged on Wednesday when billionaire Elon Musk, a vocal republican supporter and reportedly an inspiration behind Tony Stark- a Marvel comics superhero- took a non- heroic dig at pop star Taylor Swift and jumped into the cat debate. Must wrote on X: \u201cToxoplasma gondii is a danger to our democracy.\u201d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says \u201cToxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that infects most species of warm-blooded animals, including humans, and causes the disease toxoplasmosis\u2026 the only known definitive hosts for Toxoplasma gondii are members of family Felidae (domestic cats and their relatives).\u201d A study in Nature, published on September 5 2022 says \u201cT. gondii infection was associated with mania, schizophrenia, depression, recurrent depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.\u201d Hours before connecting democracy and an infection, Musk wrote on \u2018X\u2019: \u201cFine Taylor \u2026 you win \u2026 I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.\u201d Elon Musk, who acquired Twitter and renamed it \u2018X\u2019, has 197.3 million followers on the platform. Taylor Swift has 95.2 million. Musk\u2019s comment comes right after Swift supported democrat Kamala Harris\u2019s candidature on Instagram on Wednesday. Swift had signed off the post as \u201cchildless cat lady.\u201d It was a not-so-veiled dig at Donald Trump and Ohio senator JD Vance, who believe that immigrants eat cats. Is it Trump\u2019s and Vance\u2019s underlying fear of the Chinese, who are rumoured to eat cats? We don\u2019t know. But we do know that right wing populist theories stereotype Asian immigrants as people who eat dogs, cats, and even jobs.   Swift, an ardent cat lover, often poses with her cat, which is curiously named Benjamin Button. Now there is no clarity if Musk wants to give away a child to Swift out of the dozen children he fathered or wants to father a child with her. Musk frequently expresses worry about the insufficient rate of procreation, as reported by The New York Times in July 2022. \u201cDoing my best to help the underpopulation crisis. A collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far.\u201d Musk wrote on July 7, 2022. But what we know is that people have accused Musk of sexual misconduct in the past. The same report in the New York Times says SpaceX paid $250,000 to a flight attendant after she accused Musk of showing her his penis. Musk denied the allegations, calling them \u201cutterly untrue.\u201d Is Musk serious about guarding Swift\u2019s cats with his life? Is it about cats or is it about the popularity of women, such as Taylor Swift and Kamala Harris? Whatever it is, cats rule this debate. ",

        "Article Content": "National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Thursday briefed Russian President Vladmir Putin on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv amid renewed efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Ukraine conflict. Doval met Putin at the Konstantinovsky Palace in St Petersburg on the margins of a conclave of the (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) grouping. \"As the prime minister told you during a telephone talk that he was keen to brief you about his visit to Ukraine and his meeting with President Zelenskyy. He (PM Modi) wanted me to come and personally brief you about the talks,\" Doval told the Russian President. The NSA said the Modi-Zelenskyy talks were in a very \"close format\". \"I have come here on the direction of Prime Minister Modi who has conveyed his highest regards to you. His visit to Moscow was greatly successful and he was highly satisfied with the visit,\" Doval was heard conveying to Putin in a video released by Russian media. The Putin-Doval meeting came nearly three weeks after Modi travelled to Ukranian capital Kyiv and held talks with Zelenskyy. Last week, the Russian President, speaking at a panel discussion at the Eastern Economic Forum in the Russian city of Vladivostok named India, Brazil and China as possible intermediaries that could play a role in resolving the conflict. In the meeting with Doval, Putin proposed a bilateral meeting with Modi on October 22 on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan next month. The summit of the grouping will be held in Kazan from October 22-24. Modi is set to attend the summit. In his talks with Zelenskyy, Modi said both Ukraine and Russia should sit together without wasting time to end the ongoing war and that India was ready to play an \"active role\" to restore peace in the region. The prime minister said India was on the side of peace since the beginning of the conflict and he would even like to contribute personally for a peaceful resolution of the crisis. Modi's nearly nine-hour visit to Ukraine, the first by an Indian prime minister since its independence in 1991, came six weeks after he held summit talks with Putin in Moscow. In the last few days, there has been calls for India's potential role in pushing peace talks between Russia and Ukraine as New Delhi has good relations with both the nations. India has been maintaining that the conflict in Ukraine must be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy. On Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni following her talks with Zelenskyy said India and China can play a role in finding a solution to the dragging conflict. A Kremlin readout of Putin-Doval meeting said the Russian president \"noted the successful development of the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between India and Russia and stressed the importance of security issues in bilateral relations, thanking the Indian side for maintaining dialogue in this area.\"  \tIt said the Russian president proposed the bilateral meeting with Modi to \"summarise the outcomes of joint work\" on the implementation of the agreements reached during the Indian leader's visit to Moscow and to outline prospects for the near future. \"We are waiting for our good friend Modi and best regards to him,\" the Russian media quoted Putin as saying in the meeting with Doval. On Wednesday, the NSA held wide-ranging talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu focusing on important issues of \"mutual interests\". \"Both sides reviewed progress in bilateral cooperation and discussed important issues of mutual interest,\" the Indian embassy in Russia said on the talks between Doval and Shoigu.

One airstrike killed five people the military said were militants threatening its troops. A second strike on a car killed at least three people, the Palestinian health ministry said.

        "Article Content": "A policeman opened fire inside a police station in the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta on Thursday, killing a suspect held on accusations of blasphemy, a local official said. The slain man was identified as Syed Khan. Police said he had been arrested the day before, after officers snatched him from an enraged mob that claimed he had insulted Prophet Muhammad. According to police official Mohammad Khurram, the officer involved in the fatal shooting has been arrested. Khurram did not provide further details. Killings of suspects while in police custody are rare in Pakistan, where accusations of blasphemy \u2014 sometimes even just rumours \u2014 are common and often spark rioting and rampage by mobs that can escalate into lynching and killings. Under Pakistan\u2019s controversial blasphemy laws, anyone found guilty of insulting Islam or Islamic religious figures can be sentenced to death \u2014 though authorities have yet to carry out death sentences for blasphemy. In the case of Khan, the man killed on Thursday, local residents claimed he had used derogatory remarks against the prophet and went after him. After he was arrested, the mob surrounded the station, demanding police hand Khan back to them so they could kill him. At one point, a man hurled a grenade at the station on Wednesday while a group of Islamists briefly blocked a key road in the city, demanding punishment for Khan.",

        "Article Content": "A Russian missile hit a civilian vessel carrying grain from Ukraine that had already left Ukrainian waters in the Black Sea, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday. Foreign minister Andrii Sybiha called the strike \u201ca brazen attack on freedom of navigation and global food security\u201d. Zelensky said the vessel was on its way to Egypt. Zelensky said there were no casualties. \u201cUkraine\u2019s food deliveries to African and Middle Eastern countries are critical,\u201d Zelensky said in a post on X. \u201cWe will continue to make every effort to safeguard our ports, the Black Sea, and food exports to global markets. Wheat and food security should never be targets for missiles.\u201d An industry source told Reuters the grain vessel was struck in Romanian waters near the mouth of the Danube river in the Black Sea overnight. Dmytro Pletenchuk, a spokesman for the Ukrainian navy, told Reuters the grain vessel was not in Ukraine\u2019s grain corridor at time of the strike. He said the vessel was in Romania\u2019s maritime economic zone. Ukraine is exporting about four million tonnes of grain a month via its Black Sea shipping corridor, which was set up in August 2023 after Russia pulled back from the Black Sea Grain Initiative brokered by the UN and Turkey. Ukraine\u2019s corridor hugs the western Black Sea coast near Romania and Bulgaria. Ukraine is one of the world\u2019s leading grain producers and exporters. Kursk offensive Zelensky said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces had anticipated Moscow\u2019s counteroffensive in the Russian region of Kursk, his first comments on the pushback this week more than a month after Ukraine\u2019s cross-border incursion. Ukraine\u2019s troops captured an enclave of western Russian territory in a surprise raid that began in early August, a move aimed at wresting the battlefield initiative from Russia including by diverting Moscow\u2019s forces from the eastern front. Its forces made rapid initial gains before stalling, while the situation around the eastern Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk, which has been the focus of Russia\u2019s main offensive operations in recent weeks, remained perilous. \u201cThe Russians have begun counter-offensive actions. It is going according to our Ukrainian plan,\u201d Zelensky told a news conference in Kyiv with Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda. A Russian commander said on Wednesday that his soldiers had taken back control of about 10 settlements in Kursk region in a counterattack. Reuters has not been able to independently verify the battlefield reports on either side. Zelensky repeated earlier assertions that Ukraine had also noticed a buildup of forces across the border with Belarus, Russia\u2019s main ally in its full-scale war on Ukraine. \u201cWe have seen it for a long time \u2014 this process is under control,\u201d he said. His comments came as fighting continued on several fronts.",

It had weakened from a Category 2 hurricane to a tropical depression as it moved northeastward over central Mississippi, but still packed winds of 55 kmph and threatened areas with dangerous storm surges early on Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. It was expected to weaken further and become a post-tropical cyclone later in the day, the center added. In the low-lying, coastal Louisiana city of Houma in Terrebonne Parish, where the storm made landfall on Wednesday evening with winds near 160 kmph, Christine Bundy, 72, was hooking up a new generator she\u2019d just bought. \u201cA Cat. 2 is nothing,\u201d she told Reuters by telephone on Thursday. \u201cThis house has been through every storm since 1975.\u201d It took the deadly hurricane Ida, a Category 4 storm that hit Louisiana in 2021, to earn Bundy\u2019s respect and fear. \u201cIda took our roof off, tore up the fence and everything,\u201d she said. \u201cWith this one, we\u2019re just cleaning up a little.\u201d Heavy rains were expected throughout the day in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida panhandle after many spots were inundated with downpours for hours. In all, some spots could see as much as 30 cm of rain before the storm completely subsides, the National Weather Service said. Government offices, schools and libraries were closed throughout the region as widespread flooding was reported. \u201cOur drainage system just couldn\u2019t keep up,\u201d said Jennifer Van Vrancken, a councilwoman in Jefferson Parish, which encompasses part of the New Orleans metropolitan area. \u201cThis will be a flood where people remember getting water inside their homes.\u201d ",

The current retirement age is 60 for men, and 50 for women in blue-collar jobs and 55 for women in white-collar jobs. The policy will be implemented starting in January next year, according to the announcement from China's legislature reported by state broadcaster CCTV. \u201cWe have more people coming into the retirement age, and so the pension fund is (facing) high pressure, that's why I think it's now time to act seriously,\u201d said Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Victoria University in Australia who studies China's population and its ties to the economy. The change will take effect progressively based on a person's birthdate. For example, a man born in January 1971 could retire at the age of 61 years and 7 months in August 2032, according to the chart released along with the policy. A man born in May 1971 could retire at the age of 61 years and 8 months in January of 2033.",

        "Article Content": "Roughly 75 per cent of the \"disengagement problems\" with China are sorted out but the bigger issue has been the increasing militarisation of the frontier, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday on the lingering border row in eastern Ladakh. In an interactive session at a think-tank in this Swiss city, Jaishankar said the Galwan Valley clashes of June 2020 affected the \"entirety\" of India-China ties, asserting that one cannot have violence at the border and then say the rest of the relationship is insulated from it. The external affairs minister said negotiations between the two sides to find a solution to the problem are underway. \"Now those negotiations are going on. We made some progress. I would say roughly you can say about 75 per cent of the disengagement problems are sorted out,\" he said at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy. \"We still have some things to do,\" Jaishankar said, responding to a question. But there is a bigger issue that both of us have brought forces close up and in that sense, there is a militarisation of the border, he said. \"How does one deal with it? I think we have to deal with it. In the meanwhile, after the clash, it has affected the entirety of the relationship because you cannot have violence at the border and then say the rest of the relationship is insulated from it,\" he said. The external affairs minister indicated that the relationship can improve if there is a resolution to the row. \"We hope that if there is a solution to the disengagement and there is a return to peace and tranquility, then we can look at other possibilities,\" he said. The Indian and Chinese troops are locked in a standoff in certain friction points in eastern Ladakh even as the two sides completed disengagement from several areas following extensive diplomatic and military talks. India has been maintaining that its ties with China cannot be normal unless there is peace in the border areas. Describing India-China relations as \"complex\", Jaishankar said the ties were kind of normalised in the late 1980s and the basis for it was that there would be peace at the border. \"The basis obviously for a good relationship, I would say even for a normal relationship, was that there would be peace and tranquility in the border. After things started to take a better turn in 1988, we had a series of agreements which stabilised the border,\" he said. \"What happened in 2020 was in violation of multiple agreements for some reasons which are still entirely not clear to us; we can speculate on it.\" \t\"The Chinese actually moved a very large number of troops to the Line of Actual Control at the border and naturally in response, we moved our troops up. It was very difficult for us because we were in the middle of a Covid lockdown at that time,\" he said. Jaishankar described the development as very dangerous. \"Now we could see straight away that this was a very dangerous development because the presence of a large number of troops in these extreme heights and extreme cold in near proximity could lead to a mishap. And that's exactly what happened in June 2022,\" he said, referring to Galwan Valley clashes. The external affairs minister said the issue for India was that why China disturbed the peace and tranquility and why they moved those troops and how to deal with this very close-up situation. \"We have now been negotiating close to four years and the first step of that is what we called disengagement which is their troops go back to their normal operating bases and our troops go back to their normal operating bases and where required we have an arrangement about patrolling because both of us patrol regularly in that border as I said it is not a legally delineated border.\" \tJaishankar is here on the final leg of his three-nation tour that also took him to Saudi Arabia and Germany.",

        "Article Content": "The World Health Organisation on Friday said it has granted its first authorisation for use of a vaccine against mpox in adults, calling it an important step toward fighting the disease in Africa and beyond. The pre-qualification of the vaccine by Bavarian Nordic A/S means that donors like GAVI the Vaccine Alliance and UNICEF can buy it. But supplies are limited because there's only a single manufacturer. \u201cThis first pre-qualification of a vaccine against mpox is an important step in our fight against the disease, both in the context of the current outbreaks in Africa, and in future,\u201d said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The UN health agency chief called for \u201curgent\u201d scale-up of procurement, donations and rollout to get the vaccine where it is needed most, along with other response measures. Under the WHO authorisation, the vaccine can be administered in people aged 18 or above in a two-dose regimen. The approval says that while the vaccine is not currently licensed for those under 18 years old, it may be used in infants, children and adolescents \u201cin outbreak settings where the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks\u201d. Officials at the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said last month that nearly 70 per cent of cases in Congo \u2014 the country hardest hit by mpox \u2014 are in children younger than 15, who also accounted for 85 per cent of deaths. On Thursday, the Africa CDC said 107 new deaths and 3,160 new cases had been recorded in the past week, just a week after it and WHO launched a continental response plan. Mpox belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox but causes milder symptoms like fever, chills and body aches. People with more serious cases can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.",

        "Article Content": "Indonesia has welcomed the birth of a baby Javan rhinoceros, a new member of one of the world's most critically endangered species, the environment and forestry ministry said. Footage captured in May from a camera set up in the Ujung Kulon National Park, a conservation area on the western tip of Java island, was released by the ministry on Thursday. The clip showed the baby, named IRIS, walking with her mother. IRIS is the mother's first-born calf and is estimated to be 3-5 months old, the ministry said. There are only about 80 Javan rhinoceros globally, all in Indonesia, according to the International Rhino Foundation. A female calf was also spotted last year, believed to have been born in February 2023. Javan rhinoceros, distinguished by their single horn, were once found throughout northeast India and Southeast Asia. They are now among the most threatened of the five rhino species, mainly due to poaching. Ardi Andono, head of Ujung Kulon, said the discovery of IRIS does not mean \"the environment in which rhinos procreate is safe from many disturbances,\" adding that there are still dangers from illegal hunters and natural disasters.

        "Article Content": "Russia's Federal Security Service on Friday accused six British diplomats of spying and said a decision has been made to withdraw their accreditation. Russian state TV quoted an official from the security service known as the FSB as saying that they will be expelled. The expulsions come as Prime Minister Keir Starmer visits Washington for talks with President Joe Biden that will include Ukraine's request to use Western-supplied weapons against targets inside Russia. Starmer said on his way to the US that Britain does not \u201cseek any conflict with Russia\u201d. \u201cRussia started this conflict. Russia illegally invaded Ukraine. Russia could end this conflict straight away,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cUkraine has the right to self-defense and we've obviously been absolutely fully supportive of Ukraine's right to self-defense \u2014 we're providing training capability, as you know. But we don't seek any conflict with Russia \u2014 that's not our intention in the slightest,\u201d he said. The FSB said it received documents indicating that the diplomats were sent to Russia by a division of the UK Foreign Office \u201cwhose main task is to inflict a strategic defeat on our country\u201d, and that they were involved in \u201cintelligence-gathering and subversive activities\u201d. Russian state TV said in a report that the six diplomats had met with independent media and rights groups that have been declared \u201cforeign agents\u201d \u2014 a label the Russian authorities have actively used against organizations and individuals critical of the Kremlin. The British Embassy in Moscow did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. There was no immediate comment from Britain's Foreign Office. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said in an online statement that \u201cWe fully agree with the assessments of the activities of the British so-called diplomats expressed by the Russian FSB. The British Embassy has gone far beyond the limits outlined by the Vienna Conventions.\" She said the diplomats were carrying out \u201csubversive actions aimed at causing harm to our people\u201d. Explusions of diplomats \u2014 both Western diplomats working in Russia and Russian diplomats working in Western countries \u2014 have become increasingly common since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russian news outlet RBC counted last year that Western countries and Japan expelled a total 670 Russian diplomats between the beginning of 2022 and October 2023, while Moscow expelled 346 diplomats in response. According to RBC, it was more than in the previous 20 years combined. In May, the UK expelled Russia's defence attache in London, alleging he was an undeclared intelligence officer, and closed several Russian diplomatic properties in Britain that it said were being used for spying.",

        "Article Content": "The US has taken action against four Chinese entities, one Pakistani company, and one Chinese individual for their supply to Pakistan's ballistic missile programme under the missile sanctions laws, a State Department statement has said.  State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller in a statement on Thursday said the US imposed sanctions on the Beijing Research Institute of Automation for Machine Building Industry (RIAMB), which has worked with Pakistan\u2019s National Development Complex (NDC), under the missile sanctions laws (i.e. the Arms Export Control Act [AECA] and the Export Control Reform Act [ECRA]).  The statement said the Beijing Research Institute had worked with NDC in the development and production of Pakistan\u2019s long-range ballistic missiles to procure equipment for testing of large-diameter rocket motors, including the Shaheen-3 and Ababeel.  \"The United States is [also] imposing sanctions on three PRC-based entities, one PRC individual, and a Pakistani entity for ballistic missile proliferation activities: PRC-based firms Hubei Huachangda Intelligent Equipment Company, Universal Enterprise Limited, and Xi\u2019an Longde Technology Development Company Limited (aka Lontek); and PRC individual Luo Dongmei (aka Steed Luo) for knowingly transferring equipment and technology controlled under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Annex, in support of MTCR Category I missile programmes, to a non-MTCR country,\" the statement said.  The statement said the department also imposed sanctions on a Pakistan-based entity Innovative Equipment under the missile sanctions laws.  \"The United States will continue to act against proliferation and associated procurement activities of concern, wherever they occur,\" the statement concluded.  The US had similarly targeted three China-based companies with sanctions in October last year for supplying missile-applicable items to Pakistan.  The US State Department had sanctioned General Technology Limited, Beijing Luo Luo Technology Development Co Ltd, and Changzhou Utek Composite Company Ltd. for supplying brazing materials used to join components in ballistic missile rocket engines, in the production of combustion chambers, and supplying mandrels and other machinery used in the production of solid-propellant rocket motors.",

        "Article Content": "A global rally led by expectations of a rate cut from central banks triggered a late surge in stocks on Thursday that sent the Sensex over the 83,000 mark in intra-day trades and helped the Nifty 50 scale another peak. The 30-share barometer spurted 1593.03 points or 1.95 per cent to touch a lifetime intra-day peak of 83116.19 in the last hour of trade. It closed at an all-time high of 82962.71, up 1439.55 points or 1.77 per cent. On the NSE, the Nifty added 470.45 points or 1.89 per cent to end at a record high of 25388.90.  Earlier, the 50-share gauge reached a peak of 25433.35, marking a rise of 514.9 points or 2 per cent. The rally was induced by an uptrend in global markets in the anticipation of a quarter percentage point rate cut by the European Central Bank. The markets second-guessed the move correctly and the ECB later cut the policy rate to 3.5 per cent even though it expected inflation to rise in the latter part of 2024. This is the second time that the ECB has cut rates since June. Next week the US Federal Reserve is expected to begin its easing cycle with at least a 25-basis- points cut. The meetings come amid reports that China is also weighing to bring down interest rates on mortgages. After the domestic markets were shut for trading, the ECB brought down interest rates as widely expected by a quarter of a percentage point. ``The Nifty rallied in the final hour of the session supported by buying seen in large-caps which outperformed the broader market. This positive up-move was supported by heightened expectations of a 25 basis points rate cut by the US Fed after the inflation data came in on expected lines,\u201d Siddhartha Khemka, head \u2014 research, wealth management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said. \u201cOverall, we expect the market to continue its ongoing momentum on the back of healthy buying by FIIs and retail participation at every dip. The key event to watch out on domestic front will be the inflation data,\u2019\u2019 he said. India\u2019s retail inflation came in at 3.65 per cent in August, below the RBI-mandated threshold. Provisional data showed overseas investors purchasing stocks worth  1,755 crore in Thursday\u2019s trade. The net purchases by domestic institutional investors lagged at  231 crore. With inflation subsiding, the European Central Bank cut interest rates again on Thursday to prop up tepid growth with lower borrowing costs for companies and home buyers. The US Federal Reserve likely won\u2019t be far behind in joining the rate-cutting process, reports AP. The bank\u2019s rate-setting council lowered the deposit rate from 3.75 per cent to 3.5 per cent at a meeting at its headquarters in Frankfurt. Bank president Christine Lagarde steered clear of any guidance on further cuts. ",

        "Article Content": "A Scotland-based Indian-origin transgender woman on Friday resigned as the head of a rape crisis centre at Edinburg after a review found that the unit set up to support victims of sexual assault had failed to protect women-only spaces.  Mridul Wadhwa stepped down as the chief executive officer of the Edinburgh Rape Crisis Centre (ERCC) after an independent report, commissioned by the Rape Crisis Scotland (RCS), found a \u201cfailure to protect women-only spaces\u201d as the CEO \u201cdid not understand the limits on her role's authority\u201d and therefore \u201cfailed to set professional standards of behaviour.\u201d  \t The review was commissioned in May in response to an Employment Tribunal case by a former member of staff of the ERCC charity over concerns around its systems and functioning.  \u201cMridul Wadhwa and the Board have decided that the time is right for a change of leadership at the ERCC,\u201d read a statement from the Board of Directors.  \u201cMridul has stood down from her role as CEO of ERCC. Recruitment of a new CEO will happen in due course. We are committed to delivering excellence while taking on board the recommendations from the independent review to ensure we place survivors\u2019 voices at the heart of our strategy,\u201d it noted.  In an earlier letter, the Board apologised and admitted it \u201cgot things wrong.\u201d \t The independent review, by legal specialist Vicky Ling, flagged \u201ca strategy which did not put survivors first; a failure to protect women-only spaces; poor review of systems, procedures and document control; and a period of weak governance.\u201d  \t Among its recommendations, the report notes: \u201cIn the light of the debate between those holding gender identity/affirmative and gender critical beliefs and the developing context of litigation, ERCC must take advice from RCS concerning the definition of 'woman' within its service. Women-only spaces and times must be protected and clearly publicised.\u201d  \t In its statement, RCS said that it was extremely concerned that for many months ERCC did not provide dedicated women-only spaces, as required by the National Service Standards.  The resignation of Wadhwa was welcomed by Harry Potter author J K Rowling, a very vocal campaigner for women-only spaces.  \u201cMridul Wadhwa is gone from Edinburgh Rape Crisis. He should have been fired the moment he said that survivors who wanted a female-only space were bigots who should 'reframe their trauma'. Those who appointed, enabled and protected Wadhwa remain in post,\u201d she posted on X.  Meanwhile, Member of Scottish Parliament Sue Webber stressed that by definition, rape crisis centres should offer a safe haven for traumatised women.  \u201cYet, instead of focussing on providing that, ERCC has been more concerned with imposing its own militant gender ideology on both staff and distressed victims,\u201d she added.",

        "Article Content": "Two private astronauts moved outside their spacecraft early on Thursday morning, conducting the first-ever commercial spacewalk. The spacewalk was the centrepiece of Polaris Dawn, a collaboration between Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur who is leading the mission. \u201cBack at home, we all have a lot of work to do, but from here, it sure looks like a perfect world,\u201d he said while standing in the hatch of the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule with the Earth above his head. After letting all of the air out of the Crew Dragon spacecraft, Isaacman and another crew member, Sarah Gillis, a SpaceX engineer, opened the top hatch and, one at a time, moved outside. The two other crew members, Scott Poteet and Anna Menon, remained inside the vehicle while also wearing spacesuits as the airless capsule was exposed to the vacuum of space. Space travel is no longer the exclusive province of professional astronauts working at governmental space agencies like Nasa, and now neither is the derring-do of spacewalks, when astronauts are protected by just their spacesuits from airless doom. The Polaris missions \u2014 this one is the first of three \u2014 aim to accelerate technological advances needed to fulfill Musk\u2019s hope of sending people to Mars someday. Those needs will include more advanced spacesuits for any attempt at off-world colonisation. During a news conference before the launch, Isaacman mused about how someone stepping onto Mars might one day wear a future version of the spacesuit that SpaceX developed for the Polaris Dawn mission. \u201cA huge honour to have that opportunity to test it out on this flight,\u201d he said. Closer to Earth, commercial spacewalks could open up other possibilities once impossible to imagine, such as technicians repairing private satellites in orbit. Isaacman has even suggested that the second Polaris mission could attempt a trip to Nasa\u2019s ageing Hubble Space Telescope to perform repairs. The spacewalks by Isaacman and Gillis were short and modest in complexity. They moved slowly and deliberately, using a handrail outside the hatch, never letting go of the spacecraft. Because there is no airlock in the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft used for the flight, the only way to perform a spacewalk is to let all the air out of the spacecraft, and then open one of the hatches. That requires all four crew members to wear spacesuits. Nasa and Soviet astronauts conducted spacewalks in a similar manner in the 1960s. As the Crew Dragon swings around Earth in an elliptical orbit that swings as close as 193km to the surface and as high as 692km, Isaacman and Sarah Gillis, a SpaceX engineer, exited the capsule for less than 10 minutes each. They passed through the hatch at the top of the Crew Dragon with the help of a handrail that SpaceX has named Skywalker, moving carefully and deliberately.",

        "Article Content": "HDFC Bank is reportedly in talks with various global lenders to sell $1 billion ( 8,400 crore) of loans to pare its credit book and bring its credit-deposit ratio down to a comfortable level. Its move comes at a time the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been asking banks to step up their deposit mobilisation efforts. Latest data from the central bank has shown that while deposit growth in the banking system stands at 10.8 per cent, the credit growth is at 13.6 per cent. A Bloomberg report said that the country\u2019s largest private sector lender is in talks with banks such as Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Apart from these banks, ICICI Bank Ltd is also interested in picking up some of the loans, the report added. The proposed loan portfolio sales, with terms yet to be finalised, could take place through pass through certificates (PTC), a debt instrument that have rights over assets backed by cash flows. It is expected that the move will enable HDFC Bank to improve its credit-deposit (CD) ratio, which is a measure of how much of a bank\u2019s deposits is being given out as loans. The lender was reportedly in separate discussions with domestic asset management companies to sell as much as  10,000 crore of loans. Earlier, it had sold a  5,000 crore loan portfolio in June. HDFC Bank\u2019s CD ratio stood at 104 per cent as of March 31, 2024 higher than the 85-88 per cent rate in the previous three fiscal years, according to ICRA Ltd.",

Now you will see that we are not just focussed on EBITDA before Esop.. because there is a large Esop charge. It is little bit of good indication, but not the perfect indication of the company.

Pant, chief economist, India Ratings and Research, said \u201cthe pickup was largely led by food & beverages whose inflation increased to 5.3 per cent in August 2024 (July 2024: 5.1 per cent)\u201d. \u201cNevertheless, the retail inflation remained benign owing to continued contraction in fuel and light (5.3 per cent) and an unchanged core inflation (3.4 per cent).\u201d \u201cThe rise in food and beverages inflation was largely led by vegetables and fruits. While vegetables inflation turned back to double-digits (10.7 per cent), fruits inflation increased to 6.5 per cent in August 2024,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, what was favourable was a broad-based decline in inflation of other key food items such as pulses, cereals and sugar. The positive effects of better kharif sowing would be visible only post- harvest, i.e. October 2024 onwards. Till that time, pulses inflation is expected to remain in double-digits and cereals inflation would also be above 6 per cent,\u201d he added. Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda, said: \u201cFrom the point of view of policy, these numbers are better than expected as the RBI had projected 4.4 per cent for Q2 and for the first two months average 3.65 per cent. Hence while the number will move towards 4 per cent in September, with the base effect getting weaker, inflation will move up. RBI will look for inflation to stay low on a durable basis and hence will be circumspect again. \u201cWe believe December will be the earliest point for considering any change in policy. The monsoon has been good but the risk factor of excess rains affecting crop prospects is something to be monitored.\u201d The government has tasked the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to ensure that the CPI inflation remains at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side. India\u2019s industrial production output decelerated to 4.8 per cent year-on-year in July 2024, mainly due to poor performance of the manufacturing and mining sectors. The manufacturing sector\u2019s growth declined to 4.6 per cent in July from 5.3 per cent a year ago. Mining output growth decelerated to 3.7 per cent from 10.7 per cent expansion a year ago.",

        "Article Content": "A Donald Trump ally came under fire after she mocked Kamala Harris' Indian heritage and said the White House would \u201csmell like curry\" if the Democratic nominee became the president. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Thursday slammed Trump\u2019s association with Laura Loomer after her post against Harris, calling it \u201crepugnant\u201d. The remark also didn\u2019t go well with some Trump supporters. Georgia  Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene said, \"This does not represent President Trump. This type of behaviour should not be tolerated ever.\u201d \tLoomer, a former congressional candidate, made the remarks on X on Sunday, days before the presidential debate in which Harris was widely seen to have outperformed her Republican rival. If the vice president wins the November 5 election, she said, \u201cThe White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call centre and the American people will only be able to convey their feedback through a customer satisfaction survey at the end of the call that nobody will understand.\u201d \tLoomer, 31, often seen as a right-wing conspiracy theorist, made the remark while commenting on a photo posted by Harris on National Grandparents Day in which the vice president talked about her grandparents from India. Harris' mother Shyamala Gopalan migrated to the US at the age of 19 to pursue higher studies. Her father Donald J Harris is from Jamaica. White House press secretary Jean-Pierre called the comments \u201crepugnant\u201d when questioned about them during the daily briefing. \u201cNo leader should ever associate with someone who spreads this kind of ugliness. This kind of racist poison, that\u2019s what this is,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cExactly the kind of hateful, decisive rhetoric that we should denounce. And should not be part of the fabric of this country. It doesn\u2019t matter your political views, you should stand and condemn \u2026 these types of just repugnant, repugnant words,\u201d she added. Previously, Loomer has called the 9/11 attacks an \u201cinside job,\u201d which Jean-Pierre brought up Thursday in her rebuke of the former president Trump\u2019s ally. \u201cNo leader should be connected to that or spreading that,\u201d she said. Several X users condemned Loomer's remark as racist. \"I\u2019ve reported this to X for a clear violation on account of racism,\" a user with the account name Lady Jane said. \"Damn, that\u2019s a really racist thing to say. That\u2019s a bad look,\" another user wrote.",

        "Article Content": "California firefighters had to douse a flaming battery in a Tesla Semi with about 50,000 gallons (190,000 liters) of water to extinguish flames after a crash, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday. In addition to the huge amount of water, firefighters used an aircraft to drop fire retardant on the \u201cimmediate area\u201d of the electric truck as a precautionary measure, the agency said in a preliminary report. Firefighters said previously that the battery reached temperatures of 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (540 Celsius) while it was in flames. The NTSB sent investigators to the Aug. 19 crash along Interstate 80 near Emigrant Gap, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northeast of Sacramento. The agency said it would look into fire risks posed by the truck's large lithium-ion battery. The agency also found that the truck was not operating on one of Tesla's partially automated driving systems at the time of the crash, the report said. The systems weren't operational and \u201ccould not be engaged,\u201d according to the agency. The crash happened about 3:13 a.m. as the tractor-trailer was being driven by a Tesla employee from Livermore, California, to a Tesla facility in Sparks, Nevada. The Semi left the road while going around a curve to the right and hit a tree, the report said. It went down a slope and came to rest against several trees. The driver was not hurt. After the crash, the Semi's lithium-ion battery ignited. Firefighters used water to put out flames and keep the batteries cool. The freeway was closed for about 15 hours as firefighters made sure the batteries were cool enough to recover the truck. Authorities took the truck to an open-air facility and monitored it for 24 hours. The battery did not reignite. The NTSB said all aspects of the crash are under investigation as it determines the cause. The agency said it intends to issue safety recommendations to prevent similar incidents. A message was left Thursday seeking comment from Tesla, which is based in Austin, Texas. After an investigation that ended in 2021, the NTSB determined that high-voltage electric vehicle battery fires pose risks to first responders and that guidelines from manufacturers about how to deal with them were inadequate. The agency, which has no enforcement powers and can only make recommendations, called for manufacturers to write vehicle-specific response guides for fighting battery fires and limiting chemical thermal runaway and reignition. The guidelines also should include information on how to safely store vehicles with damaged lithium-ion batteries, the agency said. Tesla began delivering the electric Semis in December of 2022, more than three years after CEO Elon Musk said his company would start making the trucks. Musk has said the Semi has a range per charge of 500 miles (800 kilometers) when pulling an 82,000-pound (37,000-kilo) load. ",

        "Article Content": "Boeing's U.S. West Coast factory workers will walk off the job after 96% voted on Thursday in favor of a strike, halting production of the planemaker's strongest-selling jet as it wrestles with chronic output delays and mounting debt. The workers' first strike since 2008 will start at midnight Pacific time (0700 GMT) as Friday begins, just weeks after new CEO Kelly Ortberg was brought on in August to restore faith in the planemaker after a door panel blew off a near-new 737 MAX jet in mid-air in January. Roughly 30,000 workers who produce Boeing's 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland areas voted on their first full contract in 16 years. International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) members voted 96% in favor of striking and 94.6% to reject the agreement. \"This is about respect, this is about addressing the past, and this is about fighting for our future,\" said Jon Holden, who headed the negotiations for IAM, Boeing's largest union, before announcing the vote result. \"We strike at midnight,\" he said, as members in the union hall cheered and chanted: \"Strike! Strike! Strike!\" Boeing did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The deal included a general wage increase of 25%, a $3,000 signing bonus and a pledge to build Boeing's next commercial jet in the Seattle area, provided the program was launched within the four years of the contract. Although IAM leadership recommended last Sunday that its members accept the contract, many workers had responded angrily, arguing for the originally demanded 40% pay rise and lamenting the loss of an annual bonus. \"We're going to get back to the table as quickly as we can,\" Holden told reporters, without saying how long he thought the strike would last or when talks would resume. \"This is something that we take one day at a time, one week at a time.\u201d Workers have been protesting all week in Boeing factories in the Seattle area that assemble Boeing's MAX, 777 and 767 jets. Boeing shares closed up 0.9% on Thursday before the vote results were announced but are down 36% this year on concerns over safety, production and a $60 billion debt burden. The duration of the walkout is not clear. A long strike would weigh not only on Boeing's financials, but on airlines that depend on the planemaker\u2019s jets and suppliers who manufacture parts and components for its aircraft. According to a pre-vote note from TD Cowen, a 50-day strike could cost Boeing an estimated $3 billion to $3.5 billion of cash flow. The Boeing workers' last strike in 2008 shuttered plants for 52 days and hit revenue by an estimated $100 million per day. S&P Global Ratings said that an extended strike could delay the planemaker's recovery and hurt its overall rating. Both S&P and Moody's rate Boeing one notch above junk status. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        "Article Content": "The Supreme Court said Thursday it will consider listing low-cost airline SpiceJet\u2019s plea challenging a Delhi high court order that grounded three aircraft engines after the airline defaulted on payments to lessors. A bench comprising Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Manoj Misra asked the counsel for the airline to send an e-mail seeking an urgent hearing of its plea against the high court verdict of September 11. \u201cPlease circulate the e-mail,\u201d the CJI said, adding that the appeal may be listed. A division bench of the Delhi High Court on Wednesday held that the carrier had violated an agreed interim arrangement for payment of dues and upheld an order of a single-judge bench asking the low-cost airline to ground the three engines for defaulting on the payments. The single-judge bench of the high court had on August 14 directed SpiceJet to ground three engines by August 16 and hand them over to their lessors \u2014 Team France 01 SAS and Sunbird France 02 SAS. A high court bench of Justices Rajiv Shakdher and Amit Bansal refused to interfere with an August 14 order of the single-judge bench to ground the three aircraft engines and hand them over to the lessors, and disposed of SpiceJet\u2019s appeals against it. SpiceJet had challenged the August 14 order of the single-judge bench. \u201cThe appeals are emblematic of the adage that fools create assets and wise men use them. The use of a lessor\u2019s assets without recompense, on agreed terms, by the lessee often leads to consequences which disrupt the interests of both sides,\u201d the high court said.",

        "Article Content": "India's bioeconomy has experienced significant growth, reaching a valuation of USD 151 billion by the end of 2023, according to a new report, which said that the surge highlights the bioeconomy's critical role in national development, contributing 4.25 per cent to the country's GDP and positioning India among the top five global bioeconomies.  The report, prepared by the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) and the Association of Biotechnology Led Enterprises (ABLE), outlines transformative advances across biotechnology, agricultural innovation, healthcare, and biomanufacturing, driving the sector's expansion.  It was released during a session at the Global Bio-India Summit 2024.  The report said that India's bioeconomy has experienced significant growth, reaching a valuation of USD 151 billion by the end of 2023.  \"This surge highlights the bioeconomy's critical role in national development, contributing 4.25 per cent to the country's GDP and positioning India among the top five global bioeconomies,\" it said.  One of the major drivers of this growth has been the BioE3 (Biotechnology for Economy, Environment, and Employment) Policy, the report said, noting that the policy focuses on bio-based chemicals, precision biotherapeutics, climate-resilient agriculture, and advanced research in marine and space technologies.  Rajesh S Gokhale, Secretary DBT, Chairman BIRAC & DG-BRIC said the India bioeconomy report 2024, launched at the 4th edition of Global Bio India, marks a pivotal moment in India's journey to becoming a global leader in biotechnology.  \"The report underscores India's bioeconomy growth from USD 10 billion in 2014 to USD 151 billion by 2023, driven by rising demand for vaccines and biopharmaceuticals. With the new BioE3 Policy, we are poised to accelerate this momentum, aiming to reach USD 300 billion by 2030. This report sets the foundation for India\u2019s bio-revolution and highlights our path towards global leadership in biotechnology,\" Gokhale told PTI.  The report also emphasises the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in biomanufacturing, with plans to create biomanufacturing and Bio-AI hubs.  These efforts are expected to create new employment opportunities, particularly in tier-II and tier-III cities, while supporting the integration of biotechnology across various industries, the report said.  The Bioindustrial sector remains the largest contributor to India's bioeconomy, accounting for USD 72.6 billion or 48.09 per cent of the total market, the report said.  This sector includes biofuels, bioplastics, and enzymatic applications in industries such as textiles and detergents. Biofuels, in particular, have seen a sharp rise, with ethanol production capacity increasing to 13.8 billion litres in 2023, making India the world's third-largest producer of ethanol.  The Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme, which promotes domestic ethanol production, has been central to reducing India's dependency on imported fuels and enhancing energy security, the report added.  The biopharma sector also saw impressive growth, contributing USD 53.8 billion or 35.65 per cent to the bioeconomy.  India's vaccine manufacturing capacity continues to be a global leader, with companies like Serum Institute of India (SII) producing over 3 billion doses annually. Major breakthroughs, such as the R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine and India's first quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, have highlighted India's prowess in vaccine production.  The diagnostics and medical devices segment, which grew to USD 19.4 billion, has also played a crucial role in addressing healthcare challenges, particularly through advancements in early disease detection and personalized medicine, the report said.  In the bioagri sector, which accounted for USD 12.44 billion (8.24 per cent), agricultural biotechnology continues to drive innovations in sustainable farming practices. Precision agriculture technologies, such as genetically modified crops and bio-based products like biopesticides, are being increasingly adopted to enhance agricultural productivity.  \"Bt cotton remains a key example of how biotechnology is improving crop resilience and yields, contributing to sustainable agriculture growth in India,\" the report said.  India's bioservices sector, valued at USD 12.1 billion (8.02 per cent), has emerged as a critical support system for the bioeconomy, providing contract research, clinical trials, and biotech software services, the report said.  \"This segment grew by 30 per cent in 2023, reflecting India's expanding role as a global hub for research and development. The sector's growth is expected to continue, with increasing demand for outsourced research and specialised bioservices that help accelerate product commercialisation,\" the report added.  Looking ahead, the report said India's bioeconomy is expected to continue its robust expansion, targeting a valuation of USD 300 billion by 2030.  \"This growth will be driven by advancements in sectors like bioindustrial, biopharma, and bioagri, along with strategic government policies such as the BioE3 initiative. The bioeconomy is also projected to support over 35,000 startups and create 35 million jobs by the end of the decade, underscoring its potential as a key driver of India's sustainable development and economic growth,\" it said.",

        "Article Content": "American automaker Ford on Friday said it is preparing to utilise its Chennai manufacturing plant to roll out vehicles for exports and has intimated the same to the Tamil Nadu government.  The company which in 2021 had said that it would stop manufacturing vehicles in India, has submitted a Letter of Intent (LOI) to the Tamil Nadu government, confirming its intention to utilise the Chennai plant for manufacturing for exports.  The announcement follows a meeting between Ford leadership and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin as part of his visit to the United States, Ford said in a statement.  \"This step aims to underscore our ongoing commitment to India as we intend to leverage the manufacturing expertise available in Tamil Nadu to serve new global markets,\" Ford International Markets Group President Kay Hart said.  Ford said the strategic move will see the facility repurposed to focus on manufacturing for export to global markets, as part of the company's ambitious 'Ford+ growth plan'.  It, however, said further information about the type of manufacturing and other details will be disclosed in due course.  Ford said its latest announcement reaffirms the company's commitment to India as a critical market for its global operations.  The company currently employs 12,000 individuals in Global Business Operations in Tamil Nadu, a number expected to grow by 2,500 to 3,000 jobs within the next three years, it added.  \"Combined with the engine manufacturing operations in Sanand, India represents Ford's second-largest salaried workforce worldwide,\" the company said.  In September 2021, after nearly three decades of struggling to make a mark in India, Ford Motor Co had announced that it would stop vehicle production at its two plants in the country and will sell only imported vehicles going ahead, as part of a restructuring exercise.  While the company sold its vehicle manufacturing plant at Sanand in Gujarat to Tata Motors, it could not wind down its vehicle and engine manufacturing in Chennai by the targeted timeline of second quarter of 2022.

        "Article Content": "The head of India's market regulator, Madhabi Puri Buch, said on Friday in a personal statement that she had complied with all disclosure guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), reports Reuters. \"Madhabi has complied with all the disclosure and recusal guidelines of Sebi, and in fact, maintained a proactive continuing recusal list with Sebi over and above the requirements under the guidelines,\" the statement said. Buch has faced criticism from Hindenburg Research and India's opposition political parties for alleged conflicts of interest in investigations related to the Adani Group and other corporate entities. \"The allegations made are false, incorrect, malicious and motivated,\" Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch said in the statement. In particular, Buch said she has not dealt with any regulatory matters related to her former employer ICICI Bank. Earlier this month, the main opposition Congress party alleged that the regulator head had a conflict of interest in dealings with ICICI, where she worked until 2011. The bank denied this in a statement. Buch's statement also denied allegations made by the Congress on a conflict of interest with the Mahindra Group and Dr Reddy's due to consulting fees given by these group to Dhaval Buch. Madhabi Buch recused herself from matters related to these companies, the statement said. According to a PTI report, Buchs said in a statement, \"Our income tax returns clearly have been obtained by adopting fraudulent means and illegally. This is a clear breach of not only our right to privacy (which is a fundamental right) but also a violation of the Income Tax Act.\" According to the statement, Madhabi has never dealt with any file involving Agora Advisory, Agora Partners, the Mahindra Group, Pidilite, Dr Reddy\u2019s, Alvarez and Marsal, Sembcorp, Visu Leasing or ICICI Bank at any stage after her joining Sebi.",

In a volatile trade, the 30-share BSE Sensex fell by 71.77 points or 0.09 per cent to close at 82,890.94. During the day, it dived 309.49 points or 0.37 per cent to 82,653.22. The NSE Nifty dropped 32.40 points or 0.13 per cent to 25,356.50.

In contrast, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance, IndusInd Bank, Tata Steel, Axis Bank and Tech Mahindra were among the gainers. In Asian markets, Tokyo and Shanghai settled lower, while Seoul and Hong Kong ended in positive territory. \"The market took a breather and ended on a flat note after the previous day\u2019s sharp uptick. Despite domestic CPI inflation being within the RBI's target band, the increase in food prices may influence the central bank to remain prudent on rates. \"Higher liquidity from FIIs to the domestic market and a slide in US 10-year yield increased the prospects of the FED rate cut, which will aid domestic sentiment,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. Retail inflation in August inched up to 3.65 per cent, though vegetables and pulses witnessed price rise in double digits, according to official data released on Thursday. The retail inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), however, remained below the Reserve Bank's median target of 4 per cent for the second month in a row. It was at a five-year low of 3.6 per cent in July. The headline inflation was 6.83 per cent in August 2023. European markets were trading higher in the mid-session deals. The US markets ended with gains on Thursday. A sharp fag-end rally on Thursday drove the BSE benchmark to the 83,000 level for the first time. The barometer surged 1,593.03 points or 1.95 per cent to hit its lifetime intra-day peak of 83,116.19. The index ended at a record high of 82,962.71, up by 1,439.55 points or 1.77 per cent.

        "Article Content": "Gold prices bounced by Rs 1,200 to hit nearly a two-month high level of Rs 75,550 per 10 grams in the national capital on Friday, tracking a buying rush in domestic markets by jewellers amid a firm global trend.  The precious metal had closed at Rs 74,350 per 10 grams on Thursday.  Extending its gains for the fourth straight session, silver prices also rallied by Rs 2,000 to Rs 89,000 per kilogram on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers, according to the All India Sarafa Association.  The white metal had finished at Rs 87,000 per kg in the previous close on Thursday. In the past four sessions, the metal has surged Rs 5,200 per kg.  Meanwhile, gold of 99.5 percent purity also jumped by Rs 1,200 to Rs 75,200 per 10 grams from Rs 74,000 per 10 grams in the previous close.  Traders attributed the sharp rise in gold prices to strong cues in the international markets where the rates rose to a record high as investors expect a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve next week.  Also, weddings and the ongoing festival season are driving purchases with buyers opting for gold leading to an increase in demand, traders said.  In July, gold prices have corrected sharply by Rs 5,000 to Rs 71,050 per 10 grams in the local markets after the government slashed basic customs duties on gold and silver from 15 per cent to 6 per cent.  In the Asian trading hours, Comex gold was trading 0.74 per cent high at USD 2,599.70 per ounce.  \"Comex gold prices reached a new all-time high on Friday, fuelled by the weakening dollar, as investors anticipating an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve next week,\" Kaynat Chainwala, AVP-Commodity Research, Kotak Securities, said.  According to commodity market experts, lower interest rates are positive for the bullion prices because it reduces the opportunity cost of holding the non-interest-bearing asset, making it attractive to investors.  Silver also quoted higher at $30.47 per ounce in the overseas markets.  \"Gold prices surged to new highs, exceeding $2,550 per ounce, while silver reached three-week highs, following significant rate cuts by the European Central Bank and a weakening dollar index,\" Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities of Mehta Equities Ltd, said.  According to Deveya Gaglani, Senior Research Analyst at Axis Securities, Comex gold prices experienced a strong 1.9 percent rally, the strongest since August 16 this year.  \"This week's latest inflation data has significantly increased the likelihood of a rate cut by the Fed next week. This key factor has fuelled a bullish sentiment among yellow metal traders,\" Gaglani said.",

        "Article Content": "Inflation in India has moderated but still there is a distance to cover, Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Friday.  India's retail inflation based on movement in consumer price index (CPI) was at 3.65 per cent in August, making it the second consecutive month of sub-4 per cent inflation. The government has tasked the RBI to ensure that inflation remains at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side.  \"Inflation has moderated from its peak of 7.8 per cent in April 2022 into the tolerance band of +/- 2 per cent around the target of 4 per cent, but we still have a distance to cover and cannot afford to look the other way,\" said Das in a keynote address at the Future of Finance Forum 2024 organised by the Bretton Woods Committee here.  The RBI's projections indicate that inflation is likely to ease from 5.4 per cent in 2023-24 to 4.5 per cent in 2024-25 and 4.1 per cent in 2025-26.  The Governor further said while global economic activity and trade have largely withstood downside risks, the last mile of disinflation has proved to be challenging, giving rise to financial stability risks.  \"The momentum of global disinflation is slowing, warranting caution in easing monetary policy,\" Das said adding monetary policy management by central banks has to be prudent and supply side measures by government have to be proactive.  Das noted that market expectations of rate cuts are now regaining momentum, especially after indications of a policy pivot from the US Fed, but the adverse spillovers from the \u2018higher for longer\u2019 interest rate scenario remains a contingent risk.  On the other hand there are central banks which naturally and justifiably remain averse to premature loosening of policy before inflation has been durably reined in in their countries, he said.  Central banks in these countries need to remain watchful of their domestic inflation\u2013growth balance and make policy choices, the RBI Governor added.",

        "Article Content": "The government on Friday scrapped the minimum price thresholds for onion and basmati rice to boost outbound shipments and enhance farmers' income.  The decision to remove the Minimum Export Price (MEP) on both onion and basmati rice comes ahead of assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana.  Haryana along with Punjab is the major producer of basmati rice.  According to a communication from the Department of Commerce, the USD 950 per tonne minimum export price on basmati rice has been removed.  Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said the move will help boost exports and increase farmers' income.  \"It has been decided to remove current minimum export price (MEP) of USD 950 MT for issuing Registration-cum-Allocation Certificates (RCAC) for export of Basmati Rice,\" the communication said.  The APEDA (agricultural and processed food products export development authority) has been requested to take immediate action to implement the decision and it will also closely monitor export contract for any non-realistic prices for basmati exports.  In October 2023, the government has reduced the floor price for basmati rice exports to USD 950 per tonne from USD 1,200 per tonne amid concerns that higher prices were hurting outward shipments.  The government on August 27, 2023 decided not to allow exports of basmati rice below USD 1,200 per tonne to restrict possible \"illegal\" shipment of white non-basmati rice in the garb of premium basmati rice.  India's total exports of basmati rice stood USD 5.9 billion in 2023-24.  During 2022-23 fiscal, basmati rice exports stood at USD 4.8 billion in terms of price, while in volume terms it was at 45.6 lakh tonnes.  As per the Foreign Trade Policy, APEDA is mandated to register all contracts for the export of basmati rice and issue the registration-cum-allocation certificate for the export of basmati rice.  The basmati crop is grown in kharif (summer-sown) season.  In another farmer-friendly decision ahead of assembly election in Maharashtra, the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) removed the MEP on onion with immediate effect.  In May this year, the government lifted the ban on onion exports but had imposed a USD 550 per tonne as the minimum export price (MEP), which essentially meant farmers could not sell their produce overseas at lower than this rate.  \"The Minimum Export Price (MEP) condition on export of onions is removed with immediate effect and until further orders,\" the DGFT said.  The decision to remove the MEP on onion has been taken despite high retail prices of this key kitchen item.  According to the data compiled by the Department of Consumer Affairs, the All-India average price of onion on Friday is Rs 50.83 per kg, while the modal price is Rs 50 per kg. The maximum price of onion is Rs 83 per kg and the lowest is Rs 28 per kg.  On September 5, the Centre began the first phase of retail sales of onion at a subsidised rate of Rs 35 per kg to provide relief to Delhi-NCR and Mumbai consumers from rising prices of the kitchen staple.  NCCF and NAFED, which are maintaining a buffer stock of 4.7 lakh tonnes onion on behalf of the government, have started retail sale through their stores and mobile vans.  Last week, Consumer Affairs Secretary Nidhi Khare noted that the outlook for onion availability and prices in coming months remains positive as the kharif (summer) sown area has increased sharply to 2.9 lakh hectares till last month against 1.94 lakh hectares in the year-ago period.  Further, about 38 lakh tonnes of onion are reported to be still in storage with farmers and traders, she had said. ",

        "Article Content": "Calcutta Heart Clinic & Hospital inaugurated a cath lab on September 8. The date was significant as it marked the beginning of the year-long golden jubilee celebration of the society that runs the Sector III hospital. There was another significant announcement made of a new hospital. \u201cOur second campus will be on a three-bigha plot in the Kolkata Leather Complex thana area. It should be up in two or three years and will begin operations with a general department,\u201d board president Prof Dhrubajyoti Mukhopadhyay said at a press meet held ahead of the jubilee curtain-raiser. The ceremony on Sunday began with a minute of silence to mourn the tragedy at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. After that, several doctors invited on the occasion shared good wishes for the team. Humble beginnings \n \u201cThe society was registered in 1975 by Dr Nani Guha, a freedom -fighter who earned his medical degree after being released from jail in 1945. Post-independence, Dr Guha realised that the country\u2019s healthcare system was severely lacking and resigned as head of the chest department at Calcutta National Medical College to start this society with a hospital at his own home near Park Circus,\u201d said honorary secretary of the board, Dr Kisan Pradhan. Later, the society bought land in Salt Lake\u2019s HC Block, and the foundation stone of the hospital was laid in 1986 by the then-chief minister Jyoti Basu. It opened in 1988, Dr Guha passed away in 1991, but the hospital\u2019s governing body has continued his vision. \u201cI came across a speech Dr Guha had made at the inauguration in 1986, where he mentioned that they were then focused on general medicine, but that they would one day conduct cardio-thoracic surgeries here,\u201d smiled Dr Samanta. \u201cWe are so proud to have realised his dream.\u201d Among the host of doctors at the event was Dr A.B. Dutta, the only surviving founder member of the hospital. Vital addition\n A catheterisation or cath lab is a specialised facility where doctors perform minimally invasive procedures to diagnose and treat cardiovascular conditions. Equipped with advanced imaging technology, it provides real-time, X-ray-like images of the heart, blood vessels etc. In this lab, neurological cases can also be examined. \u201cA cath lab is a crucial part of a cardiac hospital. Since we didn\u2019t have one thus far, we could only offer emergency treatment to patients suffering from acute heart attacks, and many would have to shift elsewhere for further care. That won\u2019t be necessary anymore,\u201d said Dr Alok Mazumdar, the director of the cath lab. The lab spans nearly 3,000sq feet and includes a console room with monitors to track patient readings, as well as a pre- and post-procedure room with six beds. Ancillary rooms are also attached. The facility has been set up at Rs 5 crore, including a three-year annual maintenance contract. It was funded and inaugurated by Prof Dr Sisir Kanti Chattopadhyay and named after his late wife, Chhaya Chattopadhyay. Both have been obstetricians and gynecologists. Sisir Chattopadhyay, a 90-year-old resident of BF Block, was reticent but others happily shared his long association with the hospital. \u201cYears ago, Sisirbabu used to cycle around the area and once saw a wing of our building under construction. He came up to us and asked how much we needed,\u201d shared Dr Ashok Samanta, treasurer of the board and medical director of the hospital. \u201cBack then we hesitated to even ask anyone for Rs 500, so Dr Pradhan asked Sisirbabu to donate whatever he felt right. The latter wrote Rs 500 on a cheque, but kept adding so many zeros to it that it left Dr Pradhan trembling!\u201d Samanta shared with the chuckling audience. \u201cSisirbabu\u2019s only condition was to stay anonymous.\u201d It was his wife, Dr Chhaya Chattopadhyay, who made the first donation of Rs 1 crore for the cath lab, though she later passed away from Covid at this very hospital. \u201cThey specifically wanted to help us get this lab. Despite Sisirbabu wanting to stay behind the scenes, we requested him to attend today\u2019s opening,\u201d added Dr Samanta. Golden plans\n The hospital unveiled a new logo and tagline for the jubilee celebrations: \u201cWe care from heart\u201d, and over the next year, until September 8, 2025, have planned a series of seminars, free health camps, cultural events, and lectures in memory of Dr Guha and the immediate past president Dr Sushil Kumar Mukherjee. Doctors\u2019 Day and International Nurses Day will be observed by inviting past and current doctors and nurses and they also plan to open a modular operating theatre in January, which will significantly reduce risk of infection, particularly for cardio, neuro, and orthopaedic surgeries. \u201cToday we are a multi-speciality hospital with modern facilities, affordable rates, and a human touch. We are non-commercial so profits are ploughed back into the hospital. Our disaster management team rushes to help of victims of tsunamis, cyclones, and floods and we treat patients as family and not clients,\u201d added board president Mukhopadhyay..",

        "Article Content": "A public interest litigation filed by a Purbachal resident against the Corporation over car parking has been disposed of, with the court ruling in favour of the petitioner. The Corporation is now expected to put up signs clearly marking parking zones, mentioning the parking fees, and the attendants must be in uniform. Sanjib Sinha Choudhury, a Purbachal Cluster IV resident, had lodged the case last year after his friend Ananta Mondal was assaulted by an attendant when he was trying to park his bike around the IB Block Manipal Hospitals. The Telegraph Salt Lake had published the same in \u201cParking posers: PIL against demanding an exorbitant fee for parking\u201d on December 15, 2023. \u201cEvery vehicle owner of Salt Lake suffers from this problem. The fees, the parking spaces are not mentioned clearly, the attendant has no ID card or documents\u2026 I was forced to file this PIL on behalf of the common man,\u201d says Sinha Choudhury, a businessman in his 50s. \u201cThe case was filed in the high court before the bench of Chief Justice T.S. Sivagnanam and Justice Hiranmay Bhattacharyya, and was disposed of on August 28,\u201d says Choudhury\u2019s lawyer Chandrasekhar Bag. \u201cThe judgment asks for parking spaces, fee structure, and no-parking zones to be earmarked and mentioned not only on the corporation website but also on the ground for easy access to the public. Parking attendants should be in uniform, carry identity cards and the authorities must conduct surprise visits to ensure the system is working smoothly. But Sinha Choudhury says he has seen no traction on the ground. \u201cWe served the court order to the Corporation commissioner and Bidhannagar South police station, under which my friend was first assaulted. But they have taken no steps to implement the same,\u201d says the plaintiff. \u201cRight now we ourselves are preoccupied by the RG Kar incident and are attending protest marches. But if no steps are taken by the authorities soon, I shall speak to my lawyer and make my next move,\u201d he says. In the 2023 article, The Telegraph Salt Lake had also written about Dibyayan Banerjee, an advocate from Survey Park who had filed a Right to Information (RTI) Act application, asking the Corporation to furnish details about parking, particularly about the companies that have won the parking tender contract, the revenue the civic body earns from parking etc. \u201cThe Corporation did not respond to my RTI as they are clearly trying to cover up a racket. So I appealed to the higher authority, the state information commission. They did not respond either so I\u2019m about to appeal to the central information commission now,\u201d said Banerjee, who is backed by a Phoolbagan-based social group called Citizens Forum.",

        "Article Content": "Usually never shy to comment, many protesting doctors declined to speak to reporters after the 24-minute news conference by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. More than one among those who did speak began by saying that they respected the chair of the chief minister. Some others still put up a brave face.  Here\u2019s what some of the protesters had to say: We will consult with lawyers to understand whether there is any problem with live-streaming the meeting. We are ready to pay any legal expense to find out whether the claims made by top officials of the state and the chief minister have any legal basis. We were told that there will be three cameras that will be used to record the meeting. We were also told that the recording would be shared with us only if the Supreme Court allowed that. We wanted transparency and were apprehensive that an edited version of the video would be shared with us. That is why we wanted the meeting to be live-streamed. The chief minister said she will not sit with us in the future. That\u2019s fine. We respect her chair.  We are seeking justice for our sister who we have lost in the most heinous way possible. The chief minister, while speaking at Nabanna, said she would resign if needed. We don\u2019t want to take her chair. We have never demanded that. We want to remind everyone that we are doctors and not politicians. We don\u2019t want anyone\u2019s chair. It is evident that she is under a lot of pressure and that is why she tried to portray herself as the victim. She wants to win back people\u2019s support. Our demands have not been met. The chief minister tried to divert attention from the core issue. Our protest is not only because of the lack of restrooms. We are feeling threatened in our workplace. Primarily because of certain forces in the health administration. Some people in the administration, with vested interests, are actively trying to sabotage the healthcare infrastructure. The investigation into the rape and murder has brought to the fore the rampant corruption in the healthcare system.That is what we are protesting against.  The Supreme Court proceedings are live-streamed. Then why can\u2019t our meeting be live-streamed?  The government is giving a death toll. What is the evidence that these people died because of our cease-work? Is the entire healthcare system dependent on junior doctors? The chief minister never mentioned how understaffed the hospitals are.  The chief minister is worried because we have people\u2019s support. She is trying to assuage widespread public anger. We insisted on live-streaming because a video recording can be tampered with. What if we were given only selected parts of the entire recording?  The toll that the chief minister referred to has no basis. There is no government portal recording the deaths. The chief minister was looking sad because she was under pressure. Our movement, which has garnered international attention, has put her under pressure. We are not on the back-foot. Our demands are very simple. The crime that has happened is so heinous that we will keep protesting till we get justice.",

        "Article Content": "The government on Friday scrapped a minimum price threshold that it had set previously for exports of onion as it looked to pass on the benefit of international glut to Indian farmers.  The government had previously fixed a USD 550 per tonne as the minimum export price (MEP), which essentially meant farmers could not sell their produce overseas at lower than this rate.  A DGFT notification issued on Friday removed the MEP with immediate effect.  The move comes ahead of assembly elections in Maharashtra, a key onion producing state.  The move would help promote exports of the commodity.  \"The Minimum Export Price (MEP) condition on Export of onions is removed with immediate effect and until further orders,\" the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) said in a notification.

        "Article Content": "Forty-year-old Junu Dafadar went to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital because her surgery for gall bladder removal was due on Thursday.  Eighty-year-old Rupali Raychaudhuri, suffering from shortness of breath, came to the same hospital hoping she would be admitted.  Both had to return home without treatment, a plight shared by hundreds of other patients who have been turned away from government medical colleges since the cease-work by junior doctors over the RG Kar rape and murder started on August 9.  Dafadar and Raychaudhuri were told that they could not get the care they needed because of inadequacy of doctors.  Before heading home, Raychaudhuri tried Medical College Kolkata. No luck there as well.  The ordeal of the patients goes on unabated as the doctors\u2019 strike drags on.  Dafadar, a resident of Paikpara in north Calcutta, came to RG Kar because the ticket issued from the outpatient department on August 31 mentioned that her operation was scheduled for Thursday. She carried the ticket in her hand as she came to the hospital around noon. Metro has seen the ticket.  \u201cBut a doctor told me that the operation could not be done. There aren\u2019t enough doctors. He asked me whether I was aware of the cease-work by the (junior) doctors. He also told me that unless the cease-work was lifted, the operation could not be performed,\u201d Dafadar said.  In government hospitals, senior doctors conduct operations. However, junior doctors assist them and play a key role in post-operative assessment and care. This newspaper reported on Thursday that the family of a 63-year-old woman with a stone in her gall bladder got her discharged from RG Kar within minutes of admission on Wednesday because the attending doctor told them that the hospital might not be able to provide the necessary care if she had to be operated on.  Over 8,000 junior doctors in government hospitals have been on a cease-work since a postgraduate trainee was found raped and murdered at RG Kar on August 9. An upset Dafadar said: \u201cI came to the hospital because I was told to come on Thursday. I was looking forward to the operation at RG Kar because I can\u2019t afford going anywhere else. I don\u2019t have the money to get treated at a private hospital.\u201d Talks to end the stalemate and persuade the junior doctors to return to work could not begin on Thursday as they insisted that the meeting between their representatives and the chief minister at Nabanna be live-streamed, a demand that the government rejected.  Raychaudhuri, a resident of Sovabazar in north Calcutta, came with son Pratik to RG Kar around 1.45pm.  Pratik wanted to get his mother admitted because she was gasping.  \u201cShe could not inhale. At this age, this could lead to complications. But she was refused admission on the ground that there were not enough doctors,\u201d Pratik said. He said he runs a printing press and his earnings are far from enough.  He took his mother to Medical College Kolkata around 4.30pm. \u201cBut the doctors there denied her admission citing the same reason. I can\u2019t afford to get my mother treated at a private hospital. This cease-work has become a nightmare for families like us,\u201d said Pratik.  The mother and the son returned home to Sovabazar around 6pm. When Metro contacted Saptarshi Chatterjee, medical superintendent-cum-vice-principal of RG Kar, and narrated the plight of the two patients, he sought their contact numbers.  But when this newspaper tried to pass on their numbers to Chatterjee, he could not be contacted. ",

        "Article Content": "Designated eating zones with folding tables and disposable spoons and plates. Bio-toilets that are cleaned at regular intervals. Diesel generators powering LED lights, floodlights, fans and mobile-charging units. The area near Swasthya Bhavan, in Sector V, where the protesting junior doctors have been camping for three days is organised almost to a tee, thanks to help pouring in from near and far, often anonymously. A set of prefabricated food kiosks, tents complete with folding tables and disposable spoons and dishes, came up at the site on Wednesday evening. The six contiguous tents also serve as the reception counter for food supplies, water and tarpaulin sheets that are reaching the site at regular intervals. Meals cooked on the Salt Lake campus of Jadavpur University are being supplied for lunch and dinner at the protest site. A student volunteer of Jadavpur University, who was at the site on Wednesday night, said they had cooked six pots of rice, more than 350 eggs, daal and a mishmash of vegetables. Mini-trucks carried them to the protest site. The precision with which things were put in place bore tell-tale signs of an organised effort. A 56-year-old man who was coordinating the logistics refused to be identified. \u201cThe people of the entire state are behind this effort and we don\u2019t want to be identified,\u201d he said. A routine sight at the venue is the arrival of delivery executives of online food and grocery aggregators. They are arriving with food, ORS packs, cakes and biscuits. The senders are, in most cases, anonymous. On Thursday afternoon, a man with at least half a dozen food packets arrived at the site. He was overheard telling the sender over the phone that he would drop the packets at the protest site and ensure that the sender\u2019s name was not divulged to the protesters. Apart from this, many people from different parts of the city are bringing in cartons of bottled water, boxes of cakes, biscuits, ORS packets and fruits. Moushumi Ghosh and daughter Swastika, who is pursuing a course in microbiology from Scottish Church College, came to the site with 250 water bottles and six cartons of cake. They drove from Parnasree, some 20km from the protest site. \u201cI too have a daughter. We just cannot stand and watch,\u201d said Ghosh. Ritesh Basak, a Salt Lake resident who is a member of a WhatsApp group called Joint Platform of Demand for Justice, has been coordinating the distribution of water bottles and dry food items. \u201cIt is our duty to help them in whatever way we can,\u201d said Basak. A set of 26 bio-toilets has been set up at the site. While six were set up initially, when the junior doctors started their sit-in, the rest came up in phases. Unlike similar toilets at several fares across the city, the ones at the protest site are being cleaned regularly. Workers can be seen sprinkling bleaching powder and sanitising the toilets every 30 minutes. Sources among junior doctors said the toilets have been funded by a Salt Lake-based individual. Six diesel generator vans of various capacities are stationed at the site to power high-powered LED lights and floodlights, fans and mobile charging clusters. More than eight petrol-powered generators have been placed on the pavements. They are powering lights, public address systems and portable sound boxes that are mounted on trucks. \u201cWe arranged for the logistics of the generators and the lights. The payment was made by anonymous donors,\u201d said Basak, the Salt Lake resident.",

        "Article Content": "The CBI is questioning some of those involved in the post-mortem of the RG Kar doctor for a better understanding of the crime. The understanding is crucial before the agency seeks the opinion of another set of forensic experts on the report, sources said.  The CBI has so far not found enough evidence to suggest the involvement of more than one person in the rape and murder of the junior doctor and sources said it was necessary to understand whether the injuries that have been noted in the post-mortem report could be inflicted by one person. The CBI has spoken to more than one forensic medicine expert from the three-member board that conducted the post-mortem. On Thursday, the central agency questioned Apurba Biswas, a professor of forensic medicine at RG Kar, who was among the three. The CBI questioned Biswas for the second day in a row. On Wednesday, Biswas and another forensic doctor, Molly Banerjee, were questioned. Apubra Biswas, Molly Banerjee and Rina Das comprised the three-member board of forensic medicine experts who conducted the post-mortem on August 9. \u201cBiswas is the senior-most member of the team,\u201d said a Kolkata Police officer who was a member of the Special Investigation Team that was probing the crime before the CBI took over. The post-mortem was conducted in the presence of a judicial magistrate and several other doctors and the process was videographed.  The video of the post-mortem has been handed to the CBI, officers of Kolkata Police said. The report, the sources said, mentions the name of the videographer. A CBI officer said: \u201cWe are trying to understand the findings of the post-mortem from the forensic medicine experts on two counts \u2014 pre and post-dissection of the junior doctor\u2019s body,\u201d said an officer. The post-mortem report, sources said, lists 16 external wounds and nine internal injuries. The report says there were no fractures and injuries to the muscles, bones or joints. CBI officers are trying to understand how the wounds were inflicted and what forensic medicine suggests about their nature, sources said, adding that it was vital to know why there were no bone fractures or muscle injuries. The post-mortem report mentions \u201cRigor mortis (the stiffening of muscles after death) present all over\u201d, but CBI officers want to know to what extent the rigor mortis set in when the experts found the body.  Rigor mortis, a senior forensic expert not related to the case, said ideally sets in within two to three hours of the death and is usually complete in six to eight hours.    \u201cThere are different stages. Rigor mortis is first noticeable in small muscles and gradually progresses to the entire body over time,\u201d the forensic medicine expert said. \u201cThe degree of rigor mortis in a body suggests the time the crime was committed.\u201d A CBI team met Sanjoy Roy, the arrested Kolkata Police civic volunteer, at the Presidency jail on Thursday and collected samples of his bite. Sources said Sanjoy was made to bite samples to different degrees, ranging from hard to soft. The impressions were collected before they were sent for forensic tests to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, New Delhi. The external injury marks on the junior doctor\u2019s body would be tabulated with Roy\u2019s bite marks, the sources said. The CBI has also decided to send the dental braces found on the junior doctor to the lab in New Delhi.",

        "Article Content": "Nurses need to constantly upgrade through higher academic exposure just like doctors do, medical experts said at a nursing conference on Thursday. Nursing students and teachers from different places in and outside India participated in the inaugural edition of the Kolkata Nursing Conference, held at an Alipore auditorium. \u201cThere is a common perception that conferences and academic exposures are reserved for doctors. We want to break that perception. Nurses do not get due credit or recognition. But they are as important as any others in the healthcare delivery system,\u201d said Partha Sarathi Mukherjee, secretary of the Liver Foundation West Bengal, organisers of the conference. In 2020, when Covid was at its peak, the Liver Foundation started a nursing school, Chandrakant Institute of Nursing and Health Sciences. The unit will send the two toppers from the current batch to the Indiana University School of Nursing, in Indianapolis, next spring. They will spend three months in the US for \u201cfirst-hand learning\u201d. \u201cThe students will be considered postgraduates. They will be in the status of observation, since they don\u2019t have the nursing licence in the US. But as invitees, they will go alongside the nurses at the hospital and look at procedures. They will not be administering medication for treatment but there will still be first-hand learning of different techniques that they might be able to bring back to Calcutta,\u201d said Barbara deRose, director of Global Programs, Indiana University School of  Nursing.  Madhabi Das, director of nursing at Sister Nivedita University, welcomed the move. \u201cNurses need continuous academic enrichment. There should be regular nursing conferences on the latest research in public health,\u201d said Das, chairperson of the organising committee of the conference.  Since the pandemic, virtual collaboration between different nursing students has gone up, said the participants from the US.  \u201cSince the pandemic has really brought out virtual learning, it has exploded all over the globe. The students are learning from each other. They are the nurses of the future,\u201d deRose said.  Jane von Gaudecker, associate professor at the same school in Indianapolis, said: \u201cTechnology has improved. We learn from each other. That is the major change that we have seen globally. As far as research is concerned, because technology has improved, we are having interdisciplinary collaborations from across the globe. Communication has improved.\u201d Manisha Ghosh, officer on special duty and ex-officio nursing superintendent, IPGMER & SSKM Hospital, said nurses must keep themselves updated of the latest technologies.  \u201cThey must have an understanding of the new technologies. They should be able to use modern equipment and keep track of the latest healthcare trends. What was new five years ago will become backdated in the next five years,\u201d she said. Das, who happens to be a former joint director of health services (nursing) of the state, spoke of a shortage of nurses despite many new nursing institutes having come up in the recent years. \u201cIdeally, there should be a nurse-patient ratio of 1:3 in general wards. Here, the ratio often exceeds 1:20, especially in night shifts,\u201d she said. At the inaugural session at the conference on Thursday, T. Dileep Kumar, president of the Indian Nursing Council, sought more funds for nursing education in India.  The conference had a series of sessions, focused on topics like nursing education, nursing health care, nursing research and community and public health nursing.",

        "Article Content": "A team of CBI officers turned up at the house and nursing home of Sudipto Roy, chairman of the Rogi Kalyan Samity at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, to question him about the conversation he had with Sandip Ghosh, former principal of the medical college, on the rape and murder of the junior doctor on August 9.  Roy was among the several persons, including the then officer-in-charge of Tala police station, whom Ghosh had called on his way to the medical college from his Beleghata house after hearing the news of the death, CBI sources said. The Supreme Court had on Monday wanted to know how long it takes to reach the hospital from Ghosh\u2019s house.  Roy, the Trinamul MLA from Serampore, had reached the hospital after receiving the call from Ghosh, agency officers said. A three-member CBI team reached Roy\u2019s house in Sinthee, where his nursing home is also located, and questioned him in the presence of his daughter for a little over an hour. This was the first time the central agency questioned someone from the RG Kar administration in connection with the rape and murder of the post-graduate trainee of the chest medicine department.  Roy is the president of the West Bengal Medical Council, which has show-caused Ghosh over his alleged involvement in financial irregularities at the medical college. He is also a member of the West Bengal Health Recruitment Board.  Ghosh, who resigned as the RG Kar principal days after the rape and murder, and three others were arrested by the CBI on September 2 in connection with the alleged irregularities.    Sources in the CBI said Roy was questioned about what Ghosh had told him over the phone on August 9 and whether any discussion was held about what to be told to the victim\u2019s parents. The victim\u2019s parents have said a woman who identified herself as the assistant superintendent of the hospital had called the family thrice on the morning of August 9. During the first call, the parents were told to leave for the hospital immediately as their daughter had taken ill. During the second call they were told that her condition was critical and the final call was made to inform them that their daughter died by suicide. The CBI did not want to officially comment on the questioning.  Roy later told reporters that he had received the call from Ghosh around 10am on August 9, when he was preparing to leave for RG Kar, where a meeting was to be held  at noon. \u201cI was shocked because my links with this institution are quite strong. My father was a faculty member there. I have graduated from RG Kar. I couldn\u2019t believe it (the news of death) when I received the call,\u201d Roy said.  Asked whether Rogi Kalyan Samity, whose chairman he is, was aware that  a civic volunteer had access to the hospital\u2019s wards, Roy said the Samity does not interfere with the hospital\u2019s day-to-day functioning. \u201cThat is the job of the hospital authorities,\u201d he said. Sanjay Roy, who was a civic volunteer, is in custody for the rape and murder.",

        "Article Content": "The high court granted bail to Manik Bhattacharya, a former president of the state primary education board, on Thursday.  The Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested him in October 2022 for alleged irregularities in teacher recruitment in government-aided primary schools. Justice Suvra Ghosh said Bhattacharya, a Trinamul Congress MLA, has been in custody for almost two years. His \u201cunlimited detention shall deprive him of his fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution\u201d.  In her written order, the judge said: \u201cThe petitioner is in custody for little less than two years. The charge is yet to be framed. Delay in trial cannot be wholly attributable to the petitioner. The case involves several thousands of pages of documents and a good number of witnesses to be examined. The chance of the trial being concluded in the near future is bleak. The case is based on documentary evidence collected by the ED and is in their custody.\u201d \u201cTherefore there is no scope for the petitioner to tamper with the evidence. Further detention of the petitioner shall not serve any purpose and his unlimited detention shall deprive him of his fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution.\u201d Article 21 guarantees the fundamental right to life and personal liberty. It states that no person can be deprived of their life or personal liberty except in accordance with a procedure established by law.  The Supreme Court has said on several occasions that \u201cbail is a right and jail an exception\u201d and an accused cannot be indefinitely imprisoned for delay in the trial.  Justice Ghosh has even referred to what the Supreme Court said while granting bail to former Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in her written order.  \u201cIn the judgment in Manish Sisodia (supra), the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court has granted bail to the appellant therein on account of incarceration for seventeen months upon observing that the appellant has been deprived of his right to a speedy trial, trial not having been commenced. As observed by the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court time and again, prolonged incarceration before being pronounced guilty of an offence should not be permitted to become punishment without trial and in such a case Article 21 applies irrespective of the seriousness of the crime\u201d, the written order says.  The CBI in February 2023 arrested Delhi\u2019s deputy chief minister in connection with alleged corruption in the now-scrapped excise policy.  Metro reported on November 25, 2022, that the enforcement directorate submitted before the Special (CBI-I) Court that Manik Bhattacharya had helped 325 candidates qualify TET (Teachers Eligibility Test) 2014 illegally and received  3.25 crore through intermediaries. TET is held to shortlist candidates who are going to be appointed as teachers upon clearing personality tests. The two recruitment tests, TET-2014 and TET-2017, conducted during Bhattacharya\u2019s tenure as board president are mired in allegations of irregularities.  ",

        "Article Content": "How many dishes can you think of that are made of mango? If you\u2019re scratching your head after answering aam er achar, chutney and mango shake, the buffet spread at IAM would have left you amazed. At a recent mango festival, they incorporated the king of fruits into every single dish, from soup to starters, main course to dessert. \u201cThere\u2019s no one who doesn\u2019t like mangoes. Despite this, the fruit is rather under-utilised in cooking. So, our students curated a menu around it,\u201d said Harshjeet Rai, manager events, operations and training at the Sector V hotel management institute. The buffet offered a global selection. There was Somtam salad from Laos, Mango Blossom sushi from Japan, Mango Ocean Stew from Thailand, and Mango Rice Vibes from Jamaica. \u201cThe toughest to get right was the Sunny Mango Chill. This was a cold soup, a take on the Spanish Gazpacho soup, that uses tomato, cucumber, onion and the like but we replaced some ingredients with mangoes. Guests found it refreshing, as they are mostly accustomed to hot soups, and rarely with fruit,\u201d said Shuvam Guha of the food production department. Another popular dish was the Crispy Mango Prawn Cocktail, which used mango puree and honey, alongside fish and soy sauce. The Smoky Mango Chicken Tikka received praise, as did the Silky Mango and Cottage Cheese Curry, which featured coconut milk and mango puree as a twist on the classic \u201cmalai curry\u201d recipe. \u201cSince this is the end of the mango season, we used the langra and chausa varieties,\u201d said student Arkobrata Bhattacharya. \u201cHimsagar is over but the Chausa is very sweet and ideal for making purees. The Langra, being firmer, was ideal for dishes requiring mango chunks.\u201d The dessert section did not disappoint either. There was Raw Mango Rasogolla Bliss, a mint-green dessert that looked as tempting as it tasted. Kong Firni from Kashmir was a creamy, mango-and-nutty dessert served in clay pots. A surprise highlight was the Tropical Mango Tiramisu. \u201cThis classic Italian dessert is traditionally coffee-flavoured, but we used only a hint of coffee powder, allowing the mango to shine. It was mild, soft, and delicious,\u201d Shuvam added. A presentation was delivered by Ishika Kapur and Nihal Das. \u201cMangoes are a local fruit, and we believe in being \u2018vocal for local.\u2019 We want to popularise them beyond just their raw form and encourage people to explore it in cooking,\u201d said Ishika. \u201cAlso, since this is the tail-end of the mango season, people assume the best fruits are gone and stop buying them. As a result, many late-season mangoes go waste. We purchased these and made full use of them for this festival.\u201d Maitreyee Chaudhuri, director, IAM, said sustainability was at the heart of every event they organised. \u201cIf future chefs are encouraged to support local produce, we are moving towards a better world,\u201d she said. \u201cPreviously our institute would host large-scale events, but we\u2019ve now decided to hold smaller, more frequent ones to give students more hands-on experience.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "The annual convocation of Techno India University held on August 12 at the Biswa Bangla Convention Centre was a star-studded affair. While former President Ram Nath Kovind was the chief guest, a plethora of well-known names from different fields, from Shabana Azmi to Shankar Mahadevan to Leander Paes, were in attendance as recipients of honorary D.Litt degrees. It was a gathering of over 3,000 students as two batches were getting their degrees together, the 2024 batch and the 2023 batch, of which the results had come out 11 months earlier.  If Megha Dhar of Baguiati got the gold medal for the five-year integrated BBA-MBA financial services for 2023, Rajarhat girl Aafreen Parveen got it for 2024. \u201cWhen the message came in our batch WhatsApp group 15 days before the event about who the chief guest would be, we were so excited,\u201d Megha said. \u201cGetting the degree from a former President is definitely worth the wait,\u201d said Smriti Roy, a 2023 pass-out whose Ph.D is on diaspora literature. Agreed Karunamoyee resident Bishwajit Mondal, who had topped MCA in 2023. \u201cIt is a proud moment for us,\u201d felt Swagatalaxmi Banerjee, who received the Srilekha Raha Memorial gold medal, instituted in memory of the late wife of the university\u2019s emeritus professor Atanu Raha, who taught them environmental studies. The girls were among 22 Ph.D recipients and 60 gold medallists who went up on stage, other than postgraduates and graduates. Kovind urged the students to embrace change while cultivating timeless skills like critical thinking, self management and emotional intelligence which, he said, would be of use in navigating through life. \u201cSome say we are in the middle of the fourth Industrial Revolution and traditional career paths may be losing relevance. But history tells us newer opportunities arise whenever technological changes transform society,\u201d he pointed out. Quoting a 2022 study published recently in The Lancet, a journal on global health, the former President pointed out that almost half of India\u2019s adults were not getting sufficient exercise in their daily routine. He prescribed yoga as the solution. He recounted a Cuba trip during which he learnt that the Cuban President was a regular yoga practitioner so he arranged to send a trainer teacher to Cuba within two weeks of his return. Eleven distinguished people were awarded D.Litt degrees. For Achyuta Samanta, the founder of Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), it was his 59th D.Litt. Paes, after whom the tennis arena at KIIT has been named, was effusive in his praise of Samanta for building world-class sports infrastructure at the institute. \u201cFifteen students of KIIT took part in the Paris Olympics,\u201d he announced, urging the audience to applaud for Samanta for creating facilities for hockey, cricket and football as well as running tracks. \u201cThat is why so many of our athletes come from KIIT,\u201d said the tennis legend, who has recently been inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. He also asked students to maximize their output by making the best of 24 hours every day. When Mahadevan took the mic, Azmi voiced the popular sentiment by asking him to sing. The singer obliged by presenting some lines from the film Lakshya that were penned by Azmi\u2019s husband, the lyricist Javed Akhtar. He dedicated the song, Haan yeh rasta hai tera, to the students though not many were present in the auditorium, having taken the lunch break then. Azmi recalled growing up in an atmosphere where her parents believed that arts should be used as an instrument of social change. \u201cI have tried to do that through the roles I have chosen. To appreciate arts, a fertile ground is needed for training. Academic excellence, it has been said on this stage, is very important but how you fare as an individual is equally so.\u201d Mahadevan, she pointed out, is a qualified engineer. \u201cBut I am glad that he has chosen to be a singer.\u201d She went on to mention how AI has changed the world, especially the art world. \u201cToday the choices the young generation is making are fluid. To use AI, we need a different kind of training for artistes, sportspersons and people of literature.\u201d The other honorary D.Litt recipients included Partha Pratim Chakrabarti of IIT Kharagpur from the fraternity of engineering and science, Dr. Kunal Sarkar from medical science, Dr Kali Pradip Chaudhuri, who built the first private medical college in Bengal, from medical education and Jogen Chowdhury from visual arts.",

        "Article Content": "The chief minister has asked the city to return to festivities, but most people are in no mood. They are still haunted by the rape and murder of the doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital and do not feel it appropriate to partake in elaborate celebrations.  Some plan to visit pandals only to pray for the departed doctor and many are pressuring their puja committees to decline the government grant offered for the festival. Ganesh puja last weekend was a similar mixed bag of emotions, with some pujas sombre and some creative, and it was perhaps a harbinger of the Durga puja mood to come. The Yubak Sangha Ganesh puja at the entry to BB Block had worked around the theme of fighting against rape, with posters and a canvas for visitors to sign with messages. \u201cWe cancelled our cultural programme and celebrity visits. Even Chandernagore lights, for which we\u2019d already paid an advance, have been called off,\u201d said Anindya Chatterjee, president of the club who was earlier the local Trinamul Congress councillor but did not get a ticket to contest in the last election. \u201cWe held an emergency meeting on August 16 and decided to tone things down. This is a non-political puja, and we are one with the public sentiment. Now is not the time for merry-making.\u201d Across the footbridge from Salt Lake, another puja had planned an RG Kar theme, complete with a figurine of the slain doctor. But, at the eleventh hour, they were advised by well-wishers to cancel, fearing political repercussions. Executive Palace Complex in Baguiati presented a theme puja with a 13-ft Adiyogi backdrop for Ganesha but cancelled their usual dance and cultural events. \u201cWe only had   and devotional songs, and even the DJ and band were called off during the immersion,\u201d said Ankit Agarwal, secretary of the complex. Another group named Yubak Sangha performed puja in BA Block at PNB Island and president Ratna Bhaumik, the local councillor, said it was more about rituals this time. \u201cWe have cancelled cultural programmes in view of the RG Kar incident,\u201d she said. Salt Lake Maitri Sangha\u2019s Ganesh Puja pandal resembled Kedarnath temple. \u201cI read the puja president Sabyasachi Dutta say in  on Sunday that the puja would only have rituals, but I was shocked to see film songs being sung on stage on Monday,\u201d said a CF Block resident. \u201cIt\u2019s in poor taste under the circumstances.\u201d Singer Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta performed on Tuesday. Under Tank 10, EE Block Sampriti Sangha had built a Ganesh puja pandal resembling the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft. \u201cWe present themes every year and did so this time as well. We are all upset about the RG Kar incident and have been attending protest walks but there are others to think about too. Out of our puja budget, we donated saris to needy women,\u201d said secretary Partho Chakraborty. Some residents have decided to protest against the government\u2019s role in the RG Kar incident by declining the Rs 85,000 grant offered by it for the pujas. One such is CA Block. \u201cFor evil to prosper, all that is necessary is for the good people to do nothing. Under Tank 10, EE Block Sampriti Sangha had built a Ganesh puja pandal resembling the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft. \u201cWe present themes every year and did so this time as well. We are all upset about the RG Kar incident and have been attending protest walks but there are others to think about too. Out of our puja budget, we donated saris to needy women,\u201d said secretary Partho Chakraborty. Ours may not be a huge puja but we will stand up to injustice by declining the grant,\u201d says the spokesperson for the CA Block puja, Snehashis Mukherjee. \u201cWe refuse to wait for justice through the ballot box two years later, especially when scandal after scandal is crashing out of the closet. We won\u2019t delay justice this time.\u201d \u201cI was one of the Mohun Bagan fans who planned the joint protest at the stadium with East Bengal. We were getting threat calls for our attempts. But like then, today we can muster the courage because the entire block is with us,\u201d Mukherjee says. Critics have been saying that if a puja declines the grant, they should also reject the electricity subsidy and police protection during the pujas. To this, Mukherjee retorts: \u201cWe could have rejected the electric subsidy but we only get the final amount in the bill, without clarity on the subsidy. As for the police, we hire our own guards too. \u201c CA Block\u2019s decision sparked attention from an opposition party that has offered support, but the block has declined that too. \u201cIf the government claims the grant would have percolated to ancillary industries, it is free to send them the money directly,\u201d Mukherjee says. DA Block too voted against the grant at an extraordinary general meeting. \u201cThis protest is symbolic. We\u2019re not thinking about losses or gains,\u201d said block president Samares Das. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue with puja rituals but a modern music troupe we had booked for Vijaya sammelani has been cancelled. We are sticking to in-house Rabindrasangeet songs and shows with a social message.\u201d A Sector II Block has also voted and as per majority, has decided to shun the dole. But they wish to remain anonymous. Some residents feel the puja should be separate from the protests. \u201cWe have been planning a massive puja this time, for months. Our budget exceeds 2.5 crores, and the goddess will be adorned in jewellery worth 15 crores,\u201d says Sudipto Mukherjee, IB Block\u2019s puja coordinator. \u201cResidents are very excited. Some are contributing extra subscriptions and more than 30 have applied as volunteers, including youth and homemakers who seldom come forward otherwise. Not only are we accepting the grant but are also joking that should any other puja decline it, it may be directed towards us,\u201d Sudipto says. At CK-CL Block, residents initially considered rejecting the grant, but secretary Shanti Ranjan Paul laid out the facts. \u201cThis money isn\u2019t the CM\u2019s; it\u2019s ours. If we refuse this, should we also reject electricity and water provided by the government? And what about the labourers, musicians, and dhakis who rely on the puja season for their livelihood?\u201d Besides, Paul says refusing the grant will have implications. \u201cWe\u2019ll get in the bad books of civic authorities. How do we turn to them next time we need help? We\u2019ve decided to accept the money and use it - not on the pandal or food but \u2013 to uplift needy women,\u201d he says. Tapas Sengupta, secretary of AE (Part 2)\u2019s association, says if one protests against a corrupt government, it makes no sense to decline its money and hand it back to the same authorities. \u201cAlso, we do some charity with this money, and hire laborers, cooks, and dhakis who wait for the pujas to charge a little extra. We also need this money for our own welfare,\u201d he says. \u201cDuring the pandemic, we spent lakhs in sanitising; we have to clean our green verge as the authorities don\u2019t do it, so where will this money come from?\u201d asks Sengupta, although he admits some residents are trying to wriggle out of paying subscription by citing the RG Kar issue. For many blocks, the decision remains in limbo. \u201cEveryone in our block wants to reject the money, and some residents have even offered to compensate the Rs 85,000 out of their own pockets. But our councillor is furious, and will not help us with anything hereafter if we snub the government,\u201d said a Sector I block secretary. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do!\u201d BE (East) does not have a consensus either. \u201cSome residents want to decline the dole, and some even want to slash their subscription so the puja scale is smaller,\u201d says Arindam Bhattacharya of the committee. \u201cBut we cannot take a whimsical decision, given that the very plot we perform puja in is government land that had got fenced this year. We had to take special permission to perform puja there. We have next year to think about too.\u201d At GC Block, over 90 per cent of residents want to decline the dole, but the committee\u2019s decision is on hold. \u201cWe would rather write to the government to cancel the entire grant scheme altogether,\u201d said block president Sujoy Saha. \u201cWhy offer this when the state finances are in the red?\u201d Either way, the puja\u2019s Chandannagore lights, gates, guest arstiste have been cancelled and they are wondering if the mutton feast should be called off too.",

        "Article Content": "Like others in our city, members of Abhog Bidhannagar expressed their demand for justice following the RG Kar incident. But instead of chanting \u201cWe want justice,\u201d on the streets, they sang it, at Rabindra Okakura Bhavan last week. \u201cWe had booked the hall for this event three months back and had been rehearsing all throughout. When the RG Kar incident shook the city, we initially felt that a musical performance might be inappropriate,\u201d said Saswati Adhikary, secretary of the AC Block-based cultural group. But then the set they were preparing was on Tagore\u2019s swadesh chetana (nationalistic songs). \u201cWe realised Tagore\u2019s lyrics extend beyond protests against British rule; they speak against injustice in all forms. His words are as relevant and powerful in today\u2019s context,\u201d added another member Moniratna Roy. With renewed purpose, the group channelled their anger over the RG Kar tragedy into their music. They wore black badges with their crisp red-and-white saris and kurtas as a sign of protest too. It was tough to believe that the mellifluous voices that sang Mile sabe Bharat santan and Anandadhwani jagao gagane had been shouting for justice at protest marches. Saswati herself had participated in a midnight march, returning at 4am on the day of the show. \u201cI\u2019m not even thinking about fatigue at a time like this,\u201d she said. Besides chorus numbers, there were solos like Tomari tare Ma sanpinu by Gautam Kar and Amay bolo na gahite by Lopamudra De, all led by Debjani Sarkar on harmonium, who also directed the show. \u201cWe are a professional group, trained and groomed by the late Kanchan Baran Adhikary, who passed away during the pandemic,\u201d Debjani said. \u201cToday, in fact, marks our 25th anniversary, but we didn\u2019t acknowledge this on stage as no one feels celebratory right now,\u201d Saswati, widow of Kanchan, reflected. \u201cThis show was my husband\u2019s vision. He had planned every detail, from song selection to assigning the solos, and saved it on his laptop. He is not here to see it, but we know he would have supported using this platform to protest.\u201d The audience appreciated the effort. \u201cProtest is a pillar of democracy, and music is a powerful tool. Just look at how Arijit Singh\u2019s Ar kobe has moved the masses over the RG Kar incident,\u201d said Dr Abhijit Sarkar, a paediatrician, in the audience. \u201cThis is the first live music performance I\u2019m attending addressing the incident, and Tagore\u2019s lyrics fit seamlessly.\u201d Despite the success of the show, Abhog is hesitant to take bookings to perform during Durga Puja. \u201cMy students have been asking me to select songs for protest marches, and I\u2019m suggesting Rabindrsangeet like Byartho praner aborjona and Bidhir badhon katbe tumi, which we also sang today,\u201d said Debjani. \u201cBut like the rest of the city, our members are not in the mood for Puja festivities this year, and we\u2019ve been declining offers for now.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday carried out search and seizure operations at three locations, including the ancestral house of Sandip Ghosh, the former RG Kar principal who is in custody for alleged financial irregularities at the hospital, at Chinar Park in Rajarhat. The other two addresses were in Kalindi and Tala. The central agency is probing the money trail in the alleged financial irregularities at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. Sources in the agency said the day\u2019s operations were linked to the probe.  The CBI, which is also investigating the alleged irregularities, arrested Ghosh and three others on September 2. The four are now in judicial custody. \u201cThe search and seizure operations were based on leads that emerged after scanning some of the documents collected so far,\u201d said a senior ED official. An ED team reached the house of Chandan Louha in Tala around 6.30am. The officers spoke to Louha, who is said to have received favours from Ghosh when he was the RG Kar principal, and his son and seized some documents from the house, sources said. In its forwarding note to the special CBI court during the first production of Ghosh and the other three, the  agency had mentioned that Louha was among the several who received Ghosh\u2019s \u201cundue\u201d favours. \u201cThat it is primarily revealed that Dr Sandip Ghosh showed undue favour to M/s Khama Louha by way of awarding space on rent for running a caf\u00e9 due to clout of Chandan Louha with influential people\u2026\u201d the forwarding note said. Another team reached the office of a supplier of medical instruments in Kalindi and collected several documents related to business  transactions.  A third team reached Ghosh\u2019s ancestral house at Chinar Park and waited for over an hour to get the keys to enter the locked house. The team members inspected the rooms and left after collecting some documents.  Akhtar Ali, a former deputy superintendent of RG Kar, had written to the state vigilance commission in July 2023 about Ghosh\u2019s alleged malpractices. He had said tenders amounting to several crores of rupees \u201cwere given out only to a few of the favourite bidders who were not even eligible\u201d to bid. The ED questioned Ali on Wednesday and the search and seizure operations followed.",

        "Article Content": "Martin Odegaard suffered what appeared to be a serious ankle injury as Norway beat Austria 2-1 in the Nations League on Monday, with goals from Felix Horn Myhre and a late winner from Erling Haaland. The Arsenal skipper left the pitch after receiving treatment for several minutes in the second half following a collision with Austria\u2019s Christoph Baumgartner, and Norway boss Stale Solbakken said it looked bad. Odegaard covered his face with his hands while being treated on the field midway through the second half of the game. \u201cMartin Odegaard\u2019s injury looked bad in the dressing room as well I saw he was sitting with the physiotherapists around him but he had no chance to continue and we know it was an ankle sprain,\u201d the coach said to Norwegian TV 2. \u201cYes it\u2019s a sprain, and as those of us who had played football know, with luck it can turn out ok if the ligaments aren\u2019t torn,\u201d Norway\u2019s doctor Ola Sand added that an MRI on the 25-year-old would be carried out. \u201cAnkle sprains are difficult to deal with straight away, so we almost have to see  how things go forward. We will examine him when we are back at the hotel. Maybe we use ultrasound to look at it. If we are unsure, there will be an MRI tomorrow,\u201d Sand said. Norway are second in League B Group 3, level on four points with Slovenia,  who they will play next on October 10. Odegaard was due to return from national team duty into a tough week of away games for Arsenal. The Gunners first go to London rival Tottenham on Sunday and then open their Champions League progr\u00adamme at Atalanta, the Europa League winner, four days later in Italy. A visit to Manchester City completes a gruelling week on September 22. Norway were level at 1-1 when Odegaard went off and won the game on Haaland\u2019s 80th-minute goal.",

PSG officials and Mbappe's representatives met in Paris after the France superstar asked the commission to get involved. Mbappe, who joined Real Madrid this summer on a free transfer, says PSG owes him \u20ac55 million (around $60 million). The figure equates to three months' wages, a signing bonus and an \"ethical bonus.\"  PSG, who said they were pleased with the two-hour hearing at the commission on Wednesday, but the proposal has been rejected straightaway by the France international. PSG said in a statement they recalled that Mbappe had formerly made \u201cclear, repeated public and private commitments that must be respected, having been afforded unprecedented benefits by the club over seven years in Paris.\" PSG have argued that they do not owe money to the World Cup winner under an agreement when Mbappe was sidelined ahead of the 2023-24 season \u2014 following his decision not to prolong his contract with the club \u2014 with the player allegedly stipulating that he would relinquish bonuses over his reintegration into the team. PSG said that the league's legal commission recommended \u201cmediation between the parties,\u201d which the club said it had been seeking for months. A member of the Mbappe's camp said: \"The eventuality of a mediation was mentioned this morning (Wednesday). This possibility was rejected during the meeting by the player's representative.\" The saga now looks set to be resolved in a courtroom. Mbappe's relationship with PSG ended amid deep tensions during his final season at the club. PSG felt let down by Mbappe after offering him the most lucrative contract in the club's history when he signed a new contract in 2022. But Mbappe was frustrated because he felt promises to sign key players were not kept. When he signed the new deal, he was paraded in front of fans holding up a jersey with 2025 on it. Mbappe was reportedly annoyed because the contract was until 2024 with the option for an extra year. With inputs from AP/PTI",

        "Article Content": "Close to half of women soccer fans in England and Wales have personally experienced sexist or misogynistic abuse at matches but most have never reported it to authorities, a new study by anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out revealed on Wednesday. Wolf-whistling, being questioned about their knowledge of the rules and persistent badgering were some of the forms of sexist behaviour experienced by the 1,502 people surveyed, of whom 7% said they had been touched inappropriately, 3% were victims of physical violence and 2% sexually assaulted or harassed. Although the research showed sexism was still a significant issue for female match-goers, as well as for non-binary fans, 77% said they felt safe attending matches and four in 10 stated their experiences had been improving over time. But ethnic minorities, members of the LGBTQ community, those with disabilities and younger people were more likely to feel unsafe and experience sexism in a soccer setting, the research said. The vast majority of those surveyed, 85%, said they had never reported the abuse, mostly because they didn't think it would make a difference. \"Football needs to step up to ensure sexism is taken seriously and that women feel safe and confident to report discrimination,\" said Hollie Varney, from Kick It Out. \"We've seen reports of sexism to Kick It Out increase significantly in recent seasons.\" The research has also highlighted the use of sexist language, with 53% of respondents saying they had experienced or witnessed women being told that they should be elsewhere, such as \"back in the kitchen\". Using the research data, Kick It Out has launched a campaign to ensure women fans know sexist abuse is discrimination and can be reported, and to show male fans how they can challenge those behaviours when they see them. Reports of sexism in soccer go beyond fans' experiences. In 2014, a female employee exposed sexist emails Premier League former chief executive Richard Scudamore sent to friends, forcing him to apologise. In 2018, the British Football Association was forced to apologise after it was accused of sexism for sharing a picture on X of the England women's soccer team with the caption: \"Scrub up well, don't they?\" In Spain, former soccer federation chief Luis Rubiales will stand trial for his unsolicited kiss of women's national team player Jenni Hermoso in August last year. For players and fans, this proved that despite progress in the women's game more structural change was needed. ",

        "Article Content": "Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard could face several weeks on the sidelines after injuring his right ankle during Norway's Nations League victory against Austria on Monday, according to the Norwegian team doctor. Odegaard hobbled off the pitch and was photographed using crutches as he boarded a plane back to London where he underwent further scans to reveal the extent of the injury. Arsenal face north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Sunday when they will also be without midfielder Declan Rice who is suspended. \"Such ankle injuries often take at least three weeks. Anything other than that is just a bonus. And then it can take longer,\" medic Ola Sand was quoted as saying by Norway's VG. \"Ankle injuries are very painful right away. With Martin, it was extremely painful. He became very worried. \"What we have so far obtained from the MRI examination in London is that there is probably no fracture in the ankle. In the event of a fracture, we are talking about being out of action for six weeks plus.\" Odegaard has become a talismanic figure at Arsenal and has missed only a handful of Premier League games in the last three seasons under Mikel Arteta. A lengthy absence would be a huge blow to Arteta especially as new signing Mikel Merino also out with a fractured shoulder. \"His response to the rehabilitation in the next few weeks is the most important,\" Sand added. \"It will start carefully on the bike, carefully in relation to what he can tolerate from pain. Then you take it gradually.\" After the visit to Tottenham, Arsenal begin their Champions League campaign against Atalanta next Thursday.",

        "Article Content": "James Rodr\u00edguez scored from the penalty spot and had an assist to help Colombia edge defending champions Argentina 2-1 on Tuesday in a South American World Cup Qualifier. The Argentina attack missed Lionel Messi, who was sidelined because of injury. Yerson Mosquera opened the scoring in the 25th minute but Argentina equalised in the 48th when Nico Gonzalez capitalised on a defensive blunder from the Colombians. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019 60th-minute penalty, which was awarded after a video review, secured the win at the Metropolitano Stadium. \u201cIt is a great win against an Argentina team that has won it all,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cThe weather was tough, it was so hot, but we had an excellent match. It is a fair win.\u201d World Cup champions Argentina lifted the Copa America trophy after a 1-0 overtime victory over Colombia in July. Colombia, who hadn\u2019t triumphed over Argentina since 2019, are still unbeaten in South American World Cup qualifying. Also on Tuesday, Bolivia upset Chile 2-1 at Santiago; Ecuador beat Peru 1-0, and Venezuela drew 0-0 with Uruguay. Argentina lead the round-robin competition with 18 points after eight matches, two points clear of Colombia. Uruguay are in third position with 15 points, followed by Ecuador with 14. The top six qualify directly for the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada, with the seventh place offering passage via further rounds of qualifiers. Colombia once again had the 33-year-old Rodr\u00edguez to thank after he gave a perfect cross for Mosquera to nod in and open the scoring. That equalised Carlos Valderrama\u2019s record of 11 assists in South American World Cup qualifying. A mistake by Rodr\u00edguez allowed Argentina to equalise, with Nico Gonz\u00e1lez stealing the ball from him and shooting past goalkeeper Camilo Vargas. But Rodr\u00edguez made amends when he beat Dibu Mart\u00ednez, a prolific penalty stopper, and equalised Falcao Garc\u00eda\u2019s mark of 13 goals in World Cup qualifying. Argentina\u2019s strikers Lautaro Mart\u00ednez and Julian Alvarez failed to offer as much danger as they do when veteran Messi is there to create opportunities for them. Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said the heat had an impact on the match. \u201cThe heat is the same for both, but it is evident that there were not good conditions for us to see a spectacle,\u201d the coach said. Brazil slumped to a fourth defeat in their last five qualifiers after a first-half goal by Diego Gomez gave Paraguay a 1-0 win in Asuncion. Five-time world champions Brazil, who scraped a 1-0 home win over Ecuador on Friday, are fifth in South American qualifying with 10 points, ahead of Venezuela on goal difference. Manager Dorival Jr, who took over from Tite after Brazil\u2019s quarter-final exit at the 2022 World Cup, looked forlorn on the sidelines as his side were comprehensively outplayed and fortunate not to lose by more. Brazil fell behind in the 20th minute when Gomez rifled home from the edge of the box, the ball smacking the post on its way past Alisson into the net. \u201cThe coach is still figuring out the best way for us toplay and that\u2019s reflected in the result,\u201d defender Marquinhos said.",

        "Article Content": "Former Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino has been named as the new coach of the United States men\u2019s team, US Soccer announced on Tuesday. Pochettino, who parted ways with Premier League side Chelsea in May after one season in charge, will take the reins of the national team ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by Mexico, Canada and the United States. The Argentine, a former Paris St Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager, said his decision to join US soccer was not just about football, but about the journey the country was on and he could not pass up the opportunity. \u201cThe energy, the passion, and the hunger to achieve something truly historic here \u2014 those are the things that inspired me,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI see a group of players full of talent and potential, and together, we\u2019re going to build something special that the whole nation can be proud of.\u201d US Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker said Pochettino was a \u201cserial winner with a deep passion for developing players\u201d. \u201cHis track record speaks for itself, and I am confident that he is the right choice to harness the immense potential within our talented squad. We are thrilled to have Mauricio on board as we embark on this exciting journey to achieve success on the global stage.\u201d The US have been without a permanent coach since a humiliating early exit from the Copa America on home soil in July led to the sacking of Gregg Berhalter after his second stint as head coach. Pochettino will take over after Mikey Varas, who has been appointed interim coach, oversaw friendlies against Canada last Saturday and New Zealand on Tuesday. The US drew 1-1 with New Zealand in Cincinnati after Christian Pulisic\u2019s goal was cancelled out by Ben Waine\u2019s late equaliser. The US will next play friendlies against Panama on October 12 and Mexico three days later.",

        "Article Content": "England captain Harry Kane marked his 100th senior international appearance in trademark fashion with both goals in his team's 2-0 victory over a feeble Finland side in Nations League Group B2 at Wembley on Tuesday. The 31-year-old Bayern Munich striker, who received a golden cap before kick-off and sported a pair of dazzling golden boots, broke Finland's gritty resistance with a dipping right-footed strike in the 57th minute. At times it appeared to be a battle between Kane and Finland's impressive keeper Lukas Hradecky on a wet London night with the stopper making several fine saves to deny the striker. But a razor-sharp Kane beat Hradecky again in the 76th minute, sweeping in another right-footed effort to take his England tally to a record-extending 68. Kane, who also had a first-half header ruled out for offside, was given a standing ovation when he was substituted in the 80th minute. England's win was their second under interim manager Lee Carsley after the away victory over Ireland on Saturday and puts them joint top of their Nations League group with Greece who beat Ireland 2-0 on Tuesday. While the debate about whether Carsley can become the full-time manager in the wake of Gareth Southgate's resignation following Euro 2024, the statistics make a compelling argument that Kane is his country's greatest striker. He became only the third player to score on his 100th England appearance, although Wayne Rooney and Bobby Charlton only managed to hit the net once on their big nights. \"It was a big night for me, really proud. I want to score goals and help the team. Whenever you are doubted, it makes you more hungry to prove people wrong,\" Kane, the first England men's team player to reach 100 caps since Rooney in 2014. \"I always back myself to score goals and I am excited for the future.\" Germany conceded a goal after 100 seconds but forced their way back to share the points as they drew 2-2 with the Netherlands in an entertaining clash at the Johan Cruyff Arena. Deniz Undav scored on his first start for Germany and captain Joshua Kimmich netted the second for a 2-1 half-time lead after the Dutch grabbed an early goal through Tijjani Reijnders. But the hosts recovered to equalise through Denzel Dumfries early in the second half in a game played at a quick tempo and with occasional flashes of temper to make it a spicy derby. Germany top the standings, level on four points with the second-placed Netherlands, after both won their opening group games on Saturday. Bosnia, who are third, and Hungary in fourth place have a point apiece after they drew 0-0 in Budapest. Netherlands, who beat Bosnia 5-2 in their opener, got off to a dream start as a perfect through ball from Ryan Gravenberch set Reijnders away to storm down on goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and expertly tuck the ball into the net. The Dutch had two more clear-cut chances to extend their lead but Dumfries headed wide from Xavi Simons\u2019 15th minute free kick and five minutes later Simons had a chance of his own, with only the keeper to beat, after another accurate pass from Gravenberch, but hit his effort straight at Ter Stegen. But while the home side created opportunities, the Germans dominated possession, moving the ball around quickly, and soon had the Dutch on the back foot.",

A judge ordered the six men to appear before a court following an investigation into whether Pogba was the target of extortion by his brother, Mathias Pogba, and childhood friends, the office said. The prosecutor's office said Mathias Pogba, 34, was ordered to stand trial \u201cfor the offences of attempted extortion and criminal conspiracy.\" The court date has not been announced. The five others \u2014 identified by their first names only \u2014 allegedly demanded \u20ac13 million ($14.3 million) from the France midfielder, and repeatedly intimidated him, claiming he didn't support them after he became an international star. They are accused of extortion and attempted extortion by using violence, abduction and confinement to facilitate a crime or misdemeanor, as well as criminal conspiracy. During the investigation, Pogba said he paid \u20ac100,000 to the organised group including his brother. According to French media reports, the 31-year-old player also told investigators the alleged extortionists wanted to discredit him by claiming he asked a witch doctor to cast a spell on teammate Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. Pogba denied the allegation. The case became public after Mathias posted threats on social media to share \u201cexplosive\u201d revelations about his brother, Paul's agent Rafaela Pimenta, and Mbapp\u00e9. Mathias was also a footballer who spent most of his career with lower-tier teams in Europe. Once one of the world's top midfielders, Pogba has made headlines more often for his off-field problems than for his brilliance on the field in recent years.",

He said he was happy with the \"next step in development\" for his side, who drew 2-2 with their Dutch neighbours in the Nations League on Tuesday. Since winning in Brazil 10 years ago, the Germans have lost some of their lustre, flopping at the last two World Cups.

The 2026 World Cup in North America is a long way off, but Nagelsmann is looking at each match for improvement. \"There is an awareness that every game is important,\" he said after they came back from conceding their earliest goal in 50 years when the Dutch scored after 100 seconds in the Johan Cruyff Arena. \"We have the Nations League now, the qualifiers next year and then hopefully off to the World Cup. We have 18 games left until then \u2014 if all goes well. \"The team believes in itself and that is the key. That is what we all want to see. Today we saw a team that wanted to win,\" he told reporters.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal has not been publicly announced. Arteta has been at Arsenal since December 2019 and transformed the team into Manchester City's main title rival by finishing runner-up in the last two seasons. His previous deal was due to expire at the end of this season and speculation mentioned him as a potential successor to Pep Guardiola at City. The 42-year-old Spanish coach was Guardiola's assistant at City before succeeding Unai Emery at Arsenal and winning the FA Cup in his first season in charge. Two seasons ago, Arsenal spent 248 days at the top of the league but was beaten to the title by City. No other team had spent so long in first place without being crowned league champion. Last season, Arsenal pushed City even closer when taking the title race down to the last day, and eventually finished two points behind Guardiola's team.",

        "Article Content": "The media centre at the Mohun Bagan ground \u2014 crammed with a platoon of mediapersons \u2014 had a suffocating feeling on an unusually humid Thursday afternoon. Even Mohun Bagan Super Giant coach Jose Molina expressed his displeasure. \u201cIt\u2019s bad,\u201d the Spaniard complained wiping off sweat, finding it difficult to breathe. Bagan host Mumbai City FC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday as the ISL-XI season gets going and Molina will hope Bagan will not have the experience he endured at the pigeon-hole-like media room. On May 4 evening earlier this year, when the city was finding it difficult to deal with the inhuman summer, Mumbai City FC had turned the heat on Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium, running away with the ISL Cup with a 3-1 comprehensive win. That was after Bagan had won the ISL Shield, beating the same opponents at the same venue. \u201cI have been watching some matches of the last season, but last season is a thing of the past. This is a new chapter. They are playing with the same coach but different players,\u201d Molina said. \u201cWe have a new coach and some new players. I think it\u2019ll be an absolutely different match from the last ISL final and it doesn\u2019t matter what happened last season. The past is the past, Now we have to work in the present to make for the best future possible, that is what we\u2019ll do to win tomorrow (Friday),\u201d he added. Bagan and Mumbai City, two of the strongest and most consistent teams of the ISL, have developed a rivalry that sometimes turned murky like the one in December last year. There was a flurry of red cards at the Andheri Sports Complex in Mumbai and that was followed by multiple-match bans on players. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a good rivalry,\u201d Mumbai City captain Lallianzuala Chhangte said. In most of the duels with Bagan, Chhangte had Apuia Ralte as company. The last time the two teams met, both Chhangte and Apuia worked in tandem to silence a full-to-the-brim Salt Lake Stadium.   On Friday though, Chhangte would find Ralte on the opposite side. The 23-year-old Mizo midfielder switched over to Bagan during a summer that saw Mumbai City losing some key players. \u201cI am looking forward to this match,\u201d Ralte said. Defender Anwar Ali, his current side East Bengal and parent club Delhi FC on Thursday moved the Delhi High Court and sought a stay on the suspension imposed on the player by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for \u201cillegally terminating\u201d his four-year contract with Bagan. The AIFF on Tuesday slapped a four-month suspension on Anwar after finding the defender \u201cguilty\u201d and asked him and the two clubs to pay a compensation of Rs 12.90 crore to Bagan. \u201cYes, we have filed a writ petition with the Delhi High Court and the it is listed for tomorrow (Friday). All three parties have filed the petition on various grounds,\u201d Delhi FC owner Ranjit Bajaj said. East Bengal\u2019s top official Debabrata Sarkar said that they had moved the court as they don\u2019t want the player to lose out on matches until the AIFF\u2019s Appeals Committee arrives at a decision. Anwar and rest of the East Bengal contingent reached Bengaluru on Thursday night. They play Bengaluru FC on Saturday. ",

        "Article Content": "Cristiano Ronaldo has reignited his war of words with Erik ten Hag by telling the Manchester United manager he sent out the wrong message when he said the club were a \u201clong way\u201d from being able to win the Premier League and Champions League. The five-time World Player of the Year also says Ruud van Nistelrooy would improve United if Ten Hag is prepared to listen to his new assistant manager, but insists the club needs \u201crebuilding from the bottom\u201d if it is to recapture former glories. Ronaldo claimed he had \u201cno respect\u201d for Ten Hag during a bombshell interview in November 2022 that ultimately led to his Old Trafford exit after a stormy second spell at the club. The Portuguese superstar said he felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d. The former United striker has launched a fresh assault on Ten Hag, insisting the Dutchman erred when he said the club were \u201creally a long way away\u201d from winning the title or Champions League during an interview with Dutch channel AD Sportwereld in July. \u201cThe coach \u2026 they say they cannot compete to win the League and Champions League,\u201d Ronaldo said. \u201cManchester United coach, you cannot say that you\u2019re not going to fight to win the League or Champions League. You have to be, to mentally say, \u2018listen, maybe we don\u2019t have that potential, but I cannot say that. We\u2019re going to try.\u2019 You have to try.\u201d United exercised an option to extend Ten Hag\u2019s contract 12 months to June 2026 this summer, despite initially holding talks with half-a-dozen managers as they considered replacing the Dutchman. The manager\u2019s future has been thrust into the spotlight after United lost two of their opening three games, including a 3-0 thumping by bitter rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford. Ten Hag\u2019s fellow Dutchmen, Van Nistelrooy and Rene Hake, have been recruited as assistants by the United hierarchy because they felt the manager\u2019s backroom team needed a shake-up. Ronaldo believes his former United teammate, Van Nistelrooy, can help improve the team\u2019s outlook, provided Ten Hag takes his advice on board. That the club should seek the assistance of more former players, he added. Asked whether Van Nistelrooy would make a difference, Ronaldo, who plays for Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr, said: \u201cIf Ten Hag listens to Ruud, maybe he can. I think it can help a lot because he knows the club and the club should listen the guys who were there. \u201cRoy Keane or Paul Scholes or Gary Neville, whatever, Sir Alex Ferguson. You cannot rebuild a club without knowledge. \u201cNot guys who work in (the) office. \u2018I understand a lot of football because I see football in the television every day.\u2019 No, this is not \u2026 (it) doesn\u2019t work like that. \u201cThe people who understand the football \u2026 99 per cent is the people who were there in the dressing room, who were players, who were the most successful coaches in the world. \u201c(Pep) Guardiola, Ferguson, they were a player before, they were in dressing the room.

This club needs time to rebuild because it\u2019s still one of the best clubs in the world, but they need to change. \u201cI believe that the future will be bright. I believe, but they don\u2019t depend only on the talents. It\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s all club, all, not only players, club, everything as a unit, united.

Odegaard hobbled off the pitch and was photographed using crutches as he boarded a plane back to London where he underwent further scans to reveal the extent of the injury. Arsenal face north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in the English Premier League on Sunday when they will also be without midfielder Declan Rice who is suspended. \"Such ankle injuries often take at least three weeks. Anything other than that is just a bonus. And then it can take longer,\" medic Ola Sand was quoted as saying by Norway's VG. \"Ankle injuries are very painful right away. With Martin, it was extremely painful. He became very worried. \"What we have so far obtained from the MRI examination in London is that there is probably no fracture in the ankle. In the event of a fracture, we are talking about being out of action for six weeks plus.\" Odegaard has become a talismanic figure at Arsenal and has missed only a handful of league games in the last three seasons under Mikel Arteta. A lengthy absence would be a huge blow to Arteta especially as new signing Mikel Merino also out with a fractured shoulder. \"His response to the rehabilitation in the next few weeks is the most important,\" Sand added. \"It will start carefully on the bike, carefully in relation to what he can tolerate from pain. Then you take it gradually.\"",

Each of the 45 prints by present and past faculties of the Faculty of Visual Arts, Rabindra Bharati demanded a closer inspection of the play between light and shadow. The stark black-and-white compositions evoked a deeper contemplation of the seen, the unseen, the said, and the unsaid. There is a common belief that black and white brings clarity. Yet, these works illustrated how such a palette can deepen the complexity of interpretation, adding layers of ambiguity and nuance.  Adip Dutta\u2019s works showed a surface sensitivity combined with a weaver\u2019s acuity to enmeshed lines. Paula Sengupta\u2019s pieces, rooted in the Sunderbans, drew life from submerged roots (picture, left). Jayanta Naskar\u2019s Kali images embodied women\u2019s empowerment, while Sujay Mukherjee\u2019s Phantom comics reclaimed socio-political narratives. Dolanchapa Ganguly and Surajit Chanda celebrated nature\u2019s splendour, while Subrata Biswas and Parag Roy explored humanity\u2019s dance with nature. Anindya Pandit and Rajat Sen revealed tensions in human-nature dynamics, with Sreyashi Chatterjee, Sandip Kumar Chakraborty, and Aditya Mitra highlighting fragile ecosystems. In Parthapratim Deb\u2019s monochrome prints, viewers were drawn to intriguing compositions with fluid lines and balance, urging closer observation. The titles of the prints were primarily descriptive, suggestive of a location or an action, but the image-making retained a certain elusiveness by combining enigma with playfulness.

The Padma Shri-awardee and Bharatanatyam doyen, Geeta Chandran, has been a staunch proponent of bridging the chasm between the classical and the contemporary. Her recent powerful presentation in Calcutta,   (organised by Udok Performing Arts at Gyan Manch), bore the signature of a veteran artist steadfast in her adherence to classical roots while incorporating fresh perspectives of Bharatanatyam\u2019s evolving vocabulary.  includes the complete set of Bharatnatyam\u2019s repertoire, from   to  .

A Surdas composition choreographed by Chandran, \u201c \u201d, which illustrates the hues of Vrindavan as Krishna and Balram return from grazing cattle, was performed deftly by Chatterjee. The performance demonstrated Chandran\u2019s ability to assimilate North Indian aesthetics into a heavily codified dance form from the South. This was followed by Chandran mounting a more than one-and-a-half-hour-long grand spectacle of three pieces from her expansive repertoire that evoked the powerful imagery of Shiva. Chandran drew in the audience with her elucidation of the lyrics, etching out the changing dynamics of the  \u2019s relationship with Shiva across the three pieces. In  , Chandran embodied a   who describes the myth of Shiva by invoking aspects of his identity, such as Ishana, Dakshinamurthy, Kalamari, taken from classical, folk and vernacular traditions; in  , Chandran personified the Virahotkanthita of the Ashtanayikas, tormented by the arrows of Cupid and waiting for her union with Shiva.

        "Article Content": "It is tempting, even easy, to draw comparisons between P.R. Narvekar, a veteran artist and a graduate from J.J. School of Art, and Amedeo Modigliani: their elongated, figurative, feminine forms lend themselves readily to juxtapositions. But Narvekar\u2019s women, displayed at a recent exhibition,  , at Aakriti Art Gallery, are cast in a discernibly nostalgic light. Their sexuality is more languid and less blatant than that of Modigliani\u2019s women. Narvekar captures women in mundane moments of work and leisure reminiscent of the village belles in B. Prabha\u2019s works or the lithe tribal women of Santiniketan by Haren Das. Besides the women and the children, Narvekar\u2019s works have another subliminal subject \u2014 solitude. While doing their domestic chores, playing with their children, going about their  , spending time with friends or even just enjoying some leisure, these women have sequestered themselves from the world outside. It is to the artist\u2019s credit that his figures convey a depth of emotions even though most of them are without well-defined eyes. Piquant exaggerations and playful permutations of lines, along with the scale of the works, make these shiny, black bodies arresting. His works on paper with charcoal have greater depth of field than his works in oil that are two-dimensional. Narvekar\u2019s vision, though, is tinted by a sentimental idealism that turns his depictions of rural life and the urban underclass into idyllic models untainted by the malaise of modernity and free from the ugliness of hardship and penury. The artist\u2019s visual sense is certainly canny, evident in the linear economy of his figurations as in the contrast of the dark skin and the chrome yellow of the clothes. But he aims to please the eye rather than tease the mind. Questions must be raised about the mounting of the show: the wisdom of shining strong spotlights from a close range on oil paintings with the reflection from the lights, especially on the bright chrome yellow, blotting out parts of the paintings is inexplicable.

        "Article Content": "Two exhibitions,  at Debovasha and   at the Birla Academy of Art & Culture, together underscored six decades of painting and afforded viewers an insight into the creativity of the 88-year-old artist, Ganesh Haloi. The latter was organised jointly by the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art and the Birla Academy of Art & Culture with Akar Prakar as an outreach partner in Calcutta. Roobina Karode was its guest curator. Although the title did not indicate it, Haloi\u2019s beautiful copies of the Ajanta wall paintings and some other figurative work done early in his career as an artist were displayed for the first time in a section of the second exhibition. Debovasha showcased 52 small-format gouache paintings of uniform size. It is amazing how productive Haloi is at his age. All the works bore the hallmarks of Haloi, albeit in shorthand. The artist seems to have been in a playful mood as he painted a tiny bird flitting over a field of grass (picture, right), aqueous plants and their reflections, riverine land and paddy fields reduced to simple and often geometric forms and their various configurations that have rhythms of their own. These spaces exist in the artist\u2019s imagination and are similar in their brilliance and colour to the changing patterns inside a kaleidoscope. As in his larger works, these were poetic recollections of his home at Jamalpur in Bangladesh with its paddy fields and vast network of waterways. In his larger works exhibited at the Birla Academy of Art & Culture, the artist amplified and elaborated on these themes and compositions. However, the colours were darker and more sombre, deepening the mystery of nature that inspired them. Haloi and his family had left their home in 1952 and sought refuge at Howrah station. In spite of his dire poverty, he went to the Government College of Art and Craft. Occasionally, he worked as a labourer to pay for his upkeep and fees. After passing out in the 1950s, he was employed by the Archaeological Survey of India to copy the Ajanta wall paintings. Some of his exquisite copies were exhibited at the Birla Academy of Art & Culture. Compositional structure being his forte, Haloi copied with effortless ease the various Jataka tales about the Buddha. Fading and fragmented though these paintings are, Haloi\u2019s copies of entire scenes in warm earth tones or in line drawings bring alive languid human forms in various dramatic compositions that have gained iconic status. In their disintegrated state, they look like vague recollections of dreams. Haloi had also painted the inhabitants of the villages around the Ajanta caves, such as the dignified figure of the  dressed in black (picture, left). At that time, the influence of Bengal School was quite strong on his work. Besides this, he also painted the delicate portrait of a young bride and some publicity material in vertical frames. Dipankara Buddha on his way to Tibet carrying a Bodhi tree sapling, Srikrishna Chaitanya, and charming vignettes of rural Bengal are depicted in these frames. Done in the 1960s with paint brushes, the rarefied figure drawings on paper are brittle and fragile with age. Along with his paintings, the layout of a fresco Haloi had planned and other projects were displayed too. The exhibition deserved to be on for a longer period of time.",

(photo), written and directed by Krishnendu Bhowmik, is a dark and brooding tale of love, betrayal and death. Visually, the set design conjures up an urban wasteland replete with markers of abject deprivation and, very interestingly, a ringing and insistent sound of water dripping from a height into a metal pan pierces through the gloom, suggesting a stubborn struggle to survive. The three actors, Chiranjit Das, Sujan Ghosh and Mrinal Mukhopadhyay, turn in deeply moving performances that get under the skin of the audience members, deliberately disturbing their sangfroid. Sharp political critique combines with moments of stirring melodrama to keep the audience tightly engaged with the action unfolding on the stage. The scene in which a character, stoned out of his mind, begins to psychotically eat scraps of paper is quite unsettling. , dramatised by Bidisha Ghosh with cues from a Jos\u00e9 Donoso short story, has been directed by Sumit Dey. Ghosh has to be credited for being able to preserve the quirky, fabulous quality that is the signature of the best of Latin American literature. After a very protracted and slow-moving beginning, the play gained enough steam with the introduction of the protagonist, Sebastian (played with remarkable finesse by Arindam Sardar), to move smoothly towards its conclusion. Sebastian\u2019s penchant for sleeping through the day can be read as an allegory for a mode of existence that is pointedly and studiedly at odds with the notion of capitalist productivity. Sumit Dey\u2019s fine grasp of stagecraft is evident in the creative use of the diagonals of the stage to suggest depth and distance and in the striking visuals fashioned out of innovative permutations of stage elements.

Birla Sabhaghar recently. Constantly  playing with form and content, devising new dance out of traditional material, culling music from social and religious practices of Odisha, varying the drapes of the   and the   to make it less dramatic and more contemporary, she stuns with the beauty and the range of her art.  Among the highlights of the first evening called  was the delicately spun  created out of a basic technique of Odissi, its 22 spin-and-turn patterns collectively called  . An uncannily expressive dance piece was performed hypnotically by the luminous and self-possessed Monami Nandy, the movements disciplined and lucid. She conjured her own poetry from the abstraction of pure movement. Her astonishing grace, athletic elegance, and accuracy lent vibrancy to the distinctive and powerful choreography. If the use of light had been less, like it was chasing the dancer a tad unsuccessfully,   would have been more visceral.     (picture, left), another high spot of the festival, was a tightly detailed piece revolving around a Telugu   by Annamacharya that speaks of the power that controls human destiny. The intricately textured metaphor of puppets and their controller, danced with grace and care by Biswas herself, was a fascinating lesson in  . Delicately lyrical in its interplay of gestures and facial expressions, the piece was epic in its telling of a complex yet accessible story of divine will and submission to it.   (picture, right) presented at Gyan Manch recently featured a mercurial work,   by Shashwati Garai Ghosh. In telling the tale of a dusky woman who lived life on her own terms until love came to overwhelm her and took everything away, Garai Ghosh is magical. She layers the Tagore song, \u201c \u201d, upon the story of Surpanakha, onto which there is an overlay of her dance idiom informed by her training in classical Odissi. She has a captivating stage presence as she swells with power and bristles with anger and hurt. She is fierce and determined, her body quivering with emotion as she pursues her love, dressed up in finery. Stark in her expression of desire in the crepuscular stage light, she allows it to pulsate through her body. Although no good comes of her love, this woman does not allow circumstances to get the better of her. She listens to the voice inside her that urges her to be herself.  also featured the Kathak practitioner, Sohini Debnath, whose interpretation of a   in the piece,  , questioned the presumptions around the eternally waiting Radha.

Although the national feel was almost missing and the Bangladesh connection was crying out for a renewal, the festival reached out to several generations of women directors and struck a balance between the proscenium and the intimate formats. It opened with Charbak\u2019s   (writ\u00adten and directed by Khe\u00adyali Dastidar) and was followed by the premiere of Ensemble\u2019s  . The veteran, Sohag Sen, returned to Bertolt Brecht, adapting   and  . Titled  (Fear), Sen\u2019s adaptation stitches these two domestic dramas and reworks them to suit contemporary Calcutta. Essentially Bengali in character, but metropolitan in effect, the first works on the simmering tension between a multiethnic couple after the husband (Kaushik Bose), a government officer, begins losing his grip on his job when the wife (Soma Mukherjee), a civil rights activist, starts opening up before the electronic media. Suddenly, religious identities, although reflected only in names and surnames, emerge from nowhere. In the second, an otherwise happy couple (Sujoy Prasad Chattopadhyay and Sutapa Ghosh) finds their adolescent son (Rishav Pandey) going astray. The stories meet when the couples exchange notes at drawing room meetings. In both the cases, the political ecosystem in present-day West Bengal assumes the driver\u2019s seat. Spread over 75 minutes,  catches the pulse of our fractured times. The suggestive set, with its lampshades, flower vases and interchangeable bar counters, marks the minimalism that is Ensemble\u2019s signature style these days. A credible performance from the cast, with a mature Mukherjee at the centre, makes  a compelling watch. Among the other works showcased at  , Rang\u00adroop\u2019s   (directed by Sima Mukhopadhyay) is a quaint romantic comedy reminiscent of the lost world of public theatre in Calcutta.

The exhibition curated by Brijeshwari Kumari Gohli and Harsharan Bakshi had a wide variety of works by Gobardhan Ash (1907-1996). The display was good. But there was not a single drawing or painting of the zombie-like victims of the 1943 Bengal famine that took a toll of three million lives. There was a mention of these works in the timeline, but nothing besides. Ash\u2019s career as an artist, like those of his contemporaries such as Somnath Hore, Zainul Abedin and Chittaprosad, was defined by this cataclysm which still makes news. To ignore Ash\u2019s death-haunted works depicting the skeletal bodies of famine victims would be like writing Sukumar Ray\u2019s biography without a word about Abol Tabol. Thanks to his training in the academic style at the government art school in Calcutta at 19 years of age, Ash was a powerful draughtsman but he used his skill to depict the humdrum and mundane realities of life and he excelled at it \u2014 quite inevitable for an artist who broke out of the mould imposed by outdated Western conventions. Ash was born in Begumpur in the Hooghly district into an impoverished family and, following his stint in Calcutta in 1926-30, joined the government school of arts and crafts in Madras in 1932 under Debiprasad Roy Choudhury. In 1933, he became a founder member of the Art Rebel Centre. He flitted from one job to the other and, in 1937, won awards for his exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts when it existed in a room located in the Indian Museum. Ash was employed as an artist at the central ordnance department in Agra in 1944 and at the Indian Institute of Art in Industry in 1946. The Calcutta Group, along with the Progressive Artists\u2019 Group of Bombay, held a joint exhibition at 1 Chowringhee Terrace in 1950. Here, Ash commanded a higher price than M.F. Husain. In 1950-51, he held his first one-person show organised by the Calcutta Group. But Ash was never a money-grubber and he preferred life in isolation in his village where he helped children with their studies and art practice. At the exhibition, there were sensitive drawings of human beings and canine and equine studies marked by a boldness of lines. There were watercolours and sketches of the grand buildings of Calcutta, the beautiful countryside of Bengal, arboreal drawings of the Botanical Gardens, a painting of a farmer tilling his land with bullocks, and other picturesque landscapes. His series on children looks strangely sinister (picture, left). Being a prolific artist, Ash had done quite a few portraits, many of people he knew and saw around himself \u2014 ordinary women who were no shrinking violets and a man wearing a Nehru cap. He did ones of great personalities too. These works need a good clean-up. He occasionally did some colourful, fantastical and idiosyncratic images, which Prinseps has strangely named the Avatar series.   The focal point of the exhibition, though, is the fascinating series of Gobardhan Ash\u2019s self-portraits executed in a variety of media. Done with pen and ink (picture, right), pastel and oil paints, these record with infinite skill and clarity of observation Ash\u2019s journey from early youth to faded old age. The intense cross-hatching adds to the mystique of these images.",

        "Article Content": "To an unsuspecting viewer, the import of the tiny object that was on display at Debovasha for the exhibition,  , might not seem like much. After all, it is only a quartz pebble carved in the shape of a heart with a few lines inscribed on it. But the diminutive size of the curio belies its mammoth historical importance \u2014 it is the only known piece of sculpture by Rabindranath Tagore. At the young age of 22, Tagore was given a pebble by his brother, Satyendranath Tagore, when he was staying with the latter in Karwar (then a part of the Bombay Presidency). The poet apparently carved the pebble in the shape of a heart \u2014 his choice of the Western heart shape opens up interesting avenues of exploration \u2014 for his beloved \u2014 her identity remains a mystery \u2014 and inscribed on it is the couplet, \u201c \u201d. Incidentally, his muse and \u2018 \u2019, Kadambari Debi, too, was in Karwar at the time. The heart of stone was ultimately gifted to the poet, Akshaychandra Choudhury, and has chang\u00aded hands many times since then. Besides the historical value of the piece, the exhibition was fascinating for the literary, friendly and filial lineages that it traced and the number of lives that the heart touched. Another exhibition hosted by Debovasha, this one was online, showcased Atin Basak\u2019s tempera etchings. It was a deeply contemplative suite of works inhabited by meditative faces and Basak\u2019s signature sparrows; but here, they are not harbingers of bad news. But more than the feelings that the pieces evoke, it is the textures on the etchings that are mesmerising.  The contrast between the smoothness of the backwashes and the rusted metal-like corrosive grain of the skin was striking. However, viewing the pieces online inevitably detracts from their textural brilliance. While online exhibitions can increase the reach of art, nothing can replace the experience of taking in an artwork and its nuances in person. ",

The latter not only blocks his charge with her kadara (dagger) but also attempts to strike back. This synchronised, one-on-one combat, unfolding amidst dramatic music and red and blue stage lights, perfectly captured the tension within the presentation that was followed by other combating pairs and groups demonstrating physical strength and relevant expressions \u2014 little wonder then that the audience viewing the West Bengal Dance Group Federation's presentation, World DanceDay 2024, at Mahajati Sadan sat transfixed.  Kumar, a veteran practitioner of Kalaripayattu, a martial art form that originated in Kerala in the 12th century, trained about 100 dancers as part of the artist-in-residence section of the programme. The outcome of the four-day workshop was a performance that took the audience to the kalaris (battle-pits) in Kerala and enabled them to savour the agile movements, athleticism, stamina and perseverance of the artists. The demonstrations of the performers\u2019 skills in weaponry bore proof of their instinctive responsiveness and technical prowess. World Dance Day 2024 also had other offerings: a total of 18 recitals were put up by dance groups across West Bengal. The best picks were Megh Mallar by Sahana Dance Troupe which adapted Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay\u2019s story into an exquisite dance-drama that foregrounded syncretism through an ancient myth; Aborton by Mamata Shankar Dance Company which portrayed the passage of time through the complex experiences and the memoryscape of a woman; and Ananda Taranga by Srijan Odissi Dance Centre that elucidated the joy of being and the spirit of universalism. This diversity of performances, from martial arts to classical dance, best captured the ethos of the International Dance Day.",

        "Article Content": "The game of  \nplayed an important role in the epic Mahabharat. The 1970s and \u201980s kids would\nremember Sunday mornings when BR Chopra\u2019s serialised version of the epic on\nDoordarshan would show Shakuni (representing Duryodhan) winning Draupadi by\ncasting a pair of stick dice. But the Sanskrit word   literally\nrefers to the dice and not the game. The game is known as   (also  \nor  ) and is considered as the origin of the popular board game\n(now also mobile game) of ludo. At 6pm on September 7,\nthe Birla Academy of Art & Culture (BAAC) presented a talk on the game of  ,\ntitled \u2018Chaupar from Puranas to Paras\u2019. Souvik Mukherjee, a faculty member at\nthe Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Kolkata, presented the talk.\nMukherjee, whose MPhil and PhD were both centered around video games, runs a\nboard game museum named after his late father-in-law Goutam Sen, an avid chess\nenthusiast, at his Ballygunge Circular Road residence in south Kolkata. The talk began with an\nintroduction from Sujaan Mukherjee, senior curator of BAAC. He said: \u201cBAAC\npresently has two permanent galleries dedicated to traditional sculpture and\nminiature art. The third gallery is on modern and contemporary art, which is presently\nunder renovation and likely to reopen early next year. But apart from that,\nBAAC has thousands of undisplayed artwork.\u201d He further added: \u201cWe are planning\na series of lectures, which will allow us to display our undisplayed artwork.\nThe talk on   will display two contemporary artworks on the game\nby two contemporary artists Sanjay Ashtaputre and Maniklal Banerjee.\u201d Souvik Mukherjee\u2019s\npresentation started with the history of  and its connection with\nthe very popular board game of ludo. He said: \u201cThe word \u2018ludo\u2019 has a Latin\norigin and means \u2018I play.\u2019 The game traces its origin to the  \nfrom India. It was introduced into England and Alfred Collier patented the game\nin 1891.\u201d He added: \u201cIn ludo,\nthe board changed from crucifix to square and the cowrie shells or stick dice\nwere replaced with cubical die. Also, the traditional cloth crucifix was\nreplaced with a square cardboard. Although usually played on cloth boards the\ngame is also played on boards permanently etched on public places like temples\nand courtyards. The courtyard in Fatehpur Sikri near Agra has a giant  \nboard. Akbar used to play the game with pieces replaced by dancing girls.\u201d The lecture moved to\ndifferent versions of the game played across the country. Mukherjee narrated:\n\u201cNot only do the rules differ, it is also known by different names in different\nparts of the country. In Sylhet (Bangladesh), it is called  ,\nmeaning ten \u2013 twenty-five, representing the minimum and maximum number obtained\nby casting seven cowrie shells.\u201d The lecture moved on\nto the two paintings displayed at two corners of the hall. The first by\nManiklal Banerjee was drawn in 1990 and shows two tribal women playing the game\n\u2014 no wonder the game has spread across all demographies. The other one, by\nSanjay Ashtaputre, was drawn in 2002. It shows the game through a puppet show.\nThe player as well as his stick die is controlled by a set of strings. The session ended with\na display of   boards complete with pieces and stick dice and\ncowrie shells. Two cloth boards were displayed. Also on display were two pairs\nof stick dice. The first stick die had numbers from 1 \u2013 4, while the other had\nnumbers 1, 3, 4 and 6. Also on display were a set of seven cowrie shells. These\nwere thrown together and a combination of up and down determined the points.\nThe demonstration was accompanied by a question-and-answer session. Sujaan Mukherjee\ncompleted that session with promises of more such interactive sessions. He\nsaid: \u201cA museum or gallery needs to be more interactive and such a session not\nonly creates awareness but allows us to display unseen artwork. Moreover, it\nmakes the gallery popular and attracts repeat visitors.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "As the Revered Martin Luther King Jr once said, \u201cIf you have a dream\u2026 you must pursue it.\u201d And Swami Vivekananda had exorted, \u201cArise! Awake! And stop not till the goal is reached\u201d. These became the soul energy which had driven me throughout and shaped my young mind, as they should have. For any musician, the journey of becoming somebody from nobody is a like dream. But, essentially, the most important and primary factor in this journey is to be under the divine providence; the tutelage of the right guru. In my case, I consider myself to be extremely lucky for being groomed by two great maestros of Indian classical music, Pandit Kanai Dutta and Pandit Shankar Ghosh. In my professional career as a performing artiste, I was lucky to have been noticed by some of the great masters of Indian Classical Music. I have seen the world of music through their eyes. This is however a dream coming true. I have played in some of the worlds\u2019 most renowned venues. The artists that I have seen in close proximity are the pillars of World Music.  Whatever I have become, I believe that it is the extreme bestowed blessings and love of my Gurus which made me see the whole world through the realization of the essence of World Music.   During the mid 1960s, Indian classical music became the sound of the century as many of the Western practitioners of music got introduced to and influenced by the Indian classical system, which, in turn, made Indian music popular throughout the world. Over the last more than three-and-a-half decades, I have seen the Western music world change for good reasons. The first journey abroad happened with Ustad Munawar Ali Khan Sahab to the UK and Germany when I was in my early twenties. Over the next 38 years, I have extensively toured the US, the UK, both Eastern and Western Europe, the Middle East, the Far East and so on. I experienced World Music through numerous sacred music festivals exposing myself to numerous forms of music and new sounds from different corners of the world. World Music as I understood is a platter of thoughts served with new sounds. Peter Gabriel was one of the first musicians to have worked extensively on this direction. Besides being a classical musician, I had great interest in other forms of music. This somehow led me to form a language of music which influences of many forms, be it jazz and blues, Latin music, North African music and folk music from different parts of the globe.  I was lucky to have worked with many symphony orchestras under Pandit Ravi Shankar , Ustad Amjad Ali Khan and Dr L. Subramanium. I would say that an inclusion of a tabla alongside a timpani or a violin section or a brass section is definitely a step towards world music. I am happy to have played with many a symphony orchestras, be it the London Symphony (with Pandit Ravi Shankar and Dr L. Subramanium), Leipzig Symphony, Royal Madrid Symphony, Scotland Symphony, Norwegian Symphony (with Ustad Amjad Ali Khan), Sao Paolo State Symphony of Brazil (with Dr L. Subramaniam), Leipzig Symphony of Germany, Kazakh Symphony of Kazakhstan, Qatar Symphony of Qatar (with Naveen Kumar), Sai Symphony, Milano Symphony of Italy, Madrid Symphony and many more. World Music is a concept in my view. You open your mind and expose yourself to several forms of music from different corners of the world. It is essential to master one form and, in my case, it was Indian classical music. To play at the great Carnegie Hall in New York so many times with Ravi Shankar  and Ustad Amjad Ali Khan Sahab; to play at the Royal Albert Hall in England; at South Bank Barbican Centre in London; and the Walt Disney Hall in Los Angeles in California have been an enormous pleasure as well as a world repute. The Hollywood Bowl, an amphitheatre in Los Angeles, California, was one of the most beautiful places in the whole world, and it marks history because, possibly, Ravi  was the first Indian to perform over there. Pandit Ravi Shankar  curated and presented a programme entitled India Calling, which was organised by National Geographic. Theatre Champ De Elysees Paris was again an experience beyond words. One of the most memorable concerts for me was the Concert for George at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in 2002. For me, to see some of the greatest names on the international music scene perform was a great eye opener. Ravi  curated and composed an orchestra as a tribute to his favourite student, George Harrison, alongside Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Jeff Lynne, Dhani Harrison and many other greats. However, the evening opened with me and Anoushka Shankar performing together and then continued playing with the orchestra which she conducted. Performing in the city of Arle, South of France, with Ravi  and Anoushka at the anniversary of the great photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson was again a great experience to cherish. The outcome of my extensive travel and exposure to different forms of music of great masters and collaboration of Indian Music with different genres by the legends I played with resulted in my formation of Taal-Tantra and several other projects. The idea of creating a band has always been in my mind since I was trying to connect the world music forms and was trying to celebrate the same through synthesis. Since the establishment of Taal-Tantra in 2000 followed by The Taal-Tantra Experience, it has borne out as the rhythm popular in recent years, and has emerged as one of the foremost world music bands regularly enthralling audiences in the Middle East, North America, Europe, Germany, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and India, experimenting with time less jazz, Indian classical music, folk music and indigenous drumming.  Though I visited so many countries in the past 40 years of my life, I have never separated myself from my roots. The more I have played at different places, the more I have discovered that there is this great soul that binds every one of us together irrespective of our cultural, temporal and spatial differences. I firmly believe that music is beyond boundaries and there is only good music that exists around us. As  performing musicians, we celebrate music every moment and every day.  However, I feel very happy to witness the celebration of World Music Day. World Music is a platter of different music from all over the world. On the one hand it gives me immense joy to see that the young generation is very keen to take this up as the legacy they bear is to be cared for with greater responsibility. On the other, it also puts emphasis on how we are connected with a thread of music globally. Not everyone is blessed with the gift of art, and specifically music. I am lucky as a musician to have seen the best and been blessed by the greatest. Music can make our soul reach the highest consciousness. And that is the greatest reward a musician can have on the World Music Day. Celebrate music.",

        "Article Content": "Music unites us all but genres unite us selectively. However, there are some genres so distant from our spectrum of sonic familiarity that they seldom initiate any act of uniting or dividing music listeners. The following list attempts to encompass some unconventional, obscure and even overlooked genres that have left a mark in the history of music. One of the oldest forms of music in existence, throat singing is a guttural style of singing still prevalent in many indigenous and ethnic communities. With controlled movement of the lips, jaws, tongue and larynx, a variety of harmonies are produced by throat singers, and different forms of throat singing have existed across the world. In Tuva, bordering northwest of Mongolia, throat singing exists as Khoomei, which, through its sustained low notes, establishes connections with the Tuvan natural landscape. A form of throat singing called Katajjaq is practiced amongst the Inuits of northern Canada, which includes sharp and short inhaled and exhaled delivery of breath. In South Africa, it has existed as Umngqokolo amongst the Xhosa of Bantu origin, taking the form of droning, sustained notes sung in two different tones simultaneously by a single person. The performance of a Noh drama has music as a significant accompaniment, which is produced by flute, three kinds of drums and vocals. Although deeply rooted in Japanese tradition since its emergence around the 14th century, the music of Noh may present a challenge to those unfamiliar with the tradition and its underlying contexts. However, the unconventional approach that the music of Noh seemingly emits is actually firmly structured and strictly abides to various rules laid out for its performance. The instrumentation of Noh theatre music has been utilised in many Japanese films, like those of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s, anime, and even in video game titles like Sekiro. Zeuhl is a widely overlooked and lesser-known subgenre of progressive rock, which incorporates operatic vocals, throbbing basslines, guitar solos, ethereal synthesizers and sluggish, martial or repetitive percussion to erect a hypnotic and transcendental sound. The birth of this genre is credited to the French band Magma, formed in 1969, and their fictional language, Kobaian, in which most of their lyrics are sung. Soon, a lot of bands, even outside of France, followed in this direction, and spawned a horde of celestial-sounding albums, cementing this genre and further defining this stellar, dreamy style. Some notable bands and artistes are Magma, Archaia, Eskaton, Koenji Hyakkei. The origin of neofolk is accredited to punk circles based in England during the 1980s, where artistes like Death In June, Sol Invictus and Current 93 cemented this genre by espousing a dark ambient sound shaped by the fusion of acoustic guitars with industrial instruments, which had an immersive and minimalistic quality. The thematic and lyrical leanings of these artistes inclined towards traditional European ethnicity and occasionally towards Nordic cultures of the past, and were often outspoken in their revolt against the modern, rational world. However, in contemporary times, the term has also been used for groups practicing traditional or ethnic musical forms, like Heilung and Wardruna of the Nordic folk genre. In 1989, the American hip-hop duo Gang Starr sampled Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker\u2019s   in their own rap song titled  . Soon, a number of rap groups followed in this new direction, which took a detour from gangster rap of the 1980s to incorporate more technical instrumentation influenced from jazz and bebop styles. Words were rhymed atop such complex rhythmic structures informed by interesting and versatile shifts and transitions. Apart from sampling jazz classics, many jazz groups also composed their own instrumental sections, influenced from jazz\u2019s adventurous exploration of sounds. Some noteworthy artistes and groups are Gang Starr, A Tribe Called Quest, Digable Planets, The Roots. It was by borrowing the synthpop sound of new wave, the agitation of post-punk and the bleakness of goth rock that the genre of darkwave came into emergence in the 1980s in Europe. Practitioners of this genre have often espoused short and simple song structures composed of catchy guitar and bass hooks blended with synthesizers and minimalistic percussion, which are arranged in dance and disco rhythmic patterns in slow or moderate tempos. With its romantic bent, the lyrics of darkwave songs usually encompass themes of isolation, heartbreak, vampirism, death, occultism and so on. The genre of darkwave has also helped popularise the trad goth fashion and aesthetic of flamboyant hairdos and black attires, complete with dark-coloured eyeliners, lipsticks and nail polishes. Some notable artists and groups are Siouxsie And The Banshees, Twin Tribes, She Past Away and Boy Harsher. Beginning with the fusion of Romani and Eastern European traditional music with punk rock structures, instrumentation and delivery, this genre began as an innovative approach to punk, and is often traced to the American band, Motherhead Bug, active during the 1990s. Songs by gypsy punk practitioners often involve multilingual lyrics with shouted or distorted vocal delivery over instruments like tambourine, accordion, fiddle and drums. Some practitioners of this style are Motherhead Bug, Gogol Bordello, Blackbird Raum and Kultur Shock. Having been popularised with the release of Steve Roden\u2019s 2001 album,  , which was composed of recorded and amplified sounds of rubbing and scraping of paper, this ambient, experimental and minimalist genre tends to amplify sounds that often get drowned or neglected in the sonic clutter of our everyday lives. Sounds emitted by different mundane objects, or that of the quiet rustling of leaves, of blowing wind, of people coughing, of machinery, and so on are the varied range of sounds that one may encounter in a lowercase album, unlike an organised arrangement of melodies, hooks, vocals and instruments characteristic of most musical genres. Some lowercase artistes to look out for are Steve Roden, Tetsu Inoue, Richard Chartier, Miki Yui. With its intended pun on hardcore, the genre of bardcore rewinds history through reimaginings of modern popular music in a style befitting that of a medieval bard\u2019s. Its emergence is usually traced to a 2017 cover of System of a Down\u2019s song,  , performed with medieval instruments by a YouTuber named Algal the Bard. However, the term was popularised during the Covid pandemic, when another YouTuber named Cornelius Link began to upload medieval-styled covers of pop and rock songs, and was soon joined in his endeavours by yet another YouTuber called Hildegard Von Blingin\u2019, who added vocals over them. Since then, several more artistes have followed suit. From covers of Rolling Stones and AC/DC to Wu-Tang Clan and Linkin Park, bardcore has them all covered. In 1913, Italian composer Luigi Russelo\u2019s work,  , shocked listeners, and with time, noise and distortion have become deliberate additions in many subgenres of rock and metal. Yet, the standalone umbrella genre of noise music strikes even harsher, with its catalogue of artistes and albums prioritising noise rather as a primary element than a secondary addition. From 1970s to 1990s, a number of prominent circuits dedicated to noise music emerged globally, like the Power Electronics and Harsh Wall Noise scenes in Europe, and the highly influential Japanoise scene in Japan, which dabbled into ear-splitting frequencies for their creative endeavours. For many, this genre serves as a trance inducing and meditative sonic journey. Some significant artistes and groups are Merzbow, Vomir and Boyd Rice.",

My Guruji, Pranab Kumar Naha, a disciple of sarod maestro Pandit Radhika Mohan Maitra, would come home to give me sarod lessons when I was a child. As I grew older, I participated in various music competitions and won first prize in most of them. But as with boys from ordinary middle-class families, I was never told that I could pursue it as a profession. So I did my engineering and MBA and worked as a full-time market research professional for over a decade. However, music was my passion and I made sure that I kept practising over the years. I started studying and researching old instruments since 2015. My Guru had told me to play an instrument with higher resonance than the sarod, to help me overcome a problem I faced while playing the  , perhaps a little too hurriedly. He suggested that I play the sursingar, an 18th century instrument created by Zafar Khan, a descendant of Tansen, of which the sarod is a modern and improved version. The sursingar also had its origin in another instrument called the Tanseni rabab, which was created by Tansen in the 16th century as a modification of the Afghani rabab. As original sursingars were too large, heavy and difficult to play, I tried other variations. Eventually, in 2019, I found a sursingar that had sympathetic strings and then customised it. I could not only retain the tonal quality of the instrument but found it easier to play a prolonged   on this sursingar. Now in 1948, Pandit Radhika Mohan Maitra had invented an instrument that had the features of both the sarod and sursingar. It was named mohanveena by the then chief producer of All India Radio, Thakur Jaideva Singh. Unfortunately, after the former\u2019s death in 1981, this instrument was not played much by anyone and was on the verge of becoming extinct. So I set to work reviving that as well. But I always kept in mind the fact that when I revived these instruments, I should bring them up to par with modern instruments. Otherwise, audiences would not want to listen to the sursingar or mohanveena. Initially, the revival of these ancient instruments helped me overcome my difficulty in playing the sarod. However, it has a far more important purpose in making the new generation aware of ancient Indian music heritage. These old instruments were, till the 19th century, very much a part of the Senia Shahjehanpur Gharana to which I belong, and so I thought that they must also be known and taken forward. For the last five years, I have started presenting public performances with these rare instruments. Before I begin my recital, I take a few minutes to share with the audience the history of these instruments. I finished the revival of sursingar and mohanveena four years ago. It was more difficult to revive the Tanseni rabab and sur-rabab (created in Bengal by Ustad Abdullah Khan of the Senia Shahjehanpur Gharana by blending three instruments \u2014 sursingar, sarod and Tanseni rabab) because unfortunately we have few, poor quality archival recordings of these two instruments and it was very difficult to judge the sound and tonal quality of these instruments. Having played the sarod for many years, I had an idea of the kind of wood the structure should be made of. My engineering background also helped me ascertain the right length, width and depth of the sound box. Still, it took me more than a year to find a suitable block of seasoned, 120-year-old wood to design the structure of these two instruments. Anyhow, I needed to hear their original sounds so I could decide what kind of strings to use, what material they should be made of, and so on. I wrote to two institutions for help in my research \u2014 Sangeet Natak Akademi and Prasar Bharati \u2014 who would have recordings of Ustad Alauddin Khan, Pandit Radhika Mohan Maitra and other greats of the early 20th century, in their archives. The recordings that I obtained from them helped me understand exactly what sound quality the instruments being revived should have. Some modifications in terms of the material of the structure also became necessary. Instead of ivory, I used ebony wood for the bridge of the instruments. I also replaced the pure wooden finger-board of the Tanseni rabab with rosewood, to get a flawless sound quality. The sursingar and mohanveena were revived four years ago. These days, whenever I present a sarod recital, I perform the   on the sursingar, then play a piece on the mohanveena before I move on to the sarod. My performance at ICCR on July 12 on the theme of \u2018the musical heritage of Bharat\u2019 also featured these two revived instruments. I have not yet given any performance with the Tanseni rabab and sur-rabab as these instruments have been revived just recently. However, if all goes well, I hope to present an inaugural performance of these two instruments in September at the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture. I started giving sarod training to students since 2019 when my Guru allowed me to do so. From around 20 of my students, at least four or five are now also training in the sursingar. A couple of them are learning to play the mohanveena. Sursingars have also been exported to USA and France so that my students there can learn to play this instrument. According to me, the level of commitment of youngsters taking up classical instrumental music is very high. One of the reasons for this may be because a classical instrument like a sarod is 10 times more expensive than say, an instrument like the guitar that you can easily purchase online. Since they have made a substantial investment, students are more serious about learning and practising these instruments. Contrary to common belief, I foresee a very bright future for classical music. More classical music concerts and festivals are being organised now than in the past, and drawing full-house audiences. In the next three or four years, along with the sursingar and mohanveena, I wish to establish Tanseni rabab and sur rabab as classical instruments. Apart from this, I am currently doing a fellowship with the Ministry of Culture, inspired by a project of the late sarod maestro Buddhadev Das Gupta, of trying to play the tunes of Tagore songs in the form of a classical  . I also wish to explore the music creations of Satyajit Ray, which were mainly influenced by Western traditions, from the perspective of Indian classical music.",

        "Article Content": "You probably haven\u2019t heard of Johan R\u00f6hr even though he has achieved 15 billion streams on Spotify. That\u2019s a number substantially higher than what Michael Jackson, Elton John or Abba has achieved. Yet, most people don\u2019t know about him. The problem is that he doesn\u2019t use his name; he relies on some 650 aliases, which show up on different playlists. According to Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter, the Stockholm-based musician has created some 2,700 songs on the platform under names like Maya \u00c5str\u00f6m, Minik Knudsen, Mingmei Hsueh and Csizmazia Etel. In fact, Overtone Studios has said that he is a \u201cpioneer in the mood music genre\u201d. His music is mainly background music, yet the reach he is enjoying on Spotify is massive. One of his most listened-to melodies is a piano interpretation of Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star under the pseudonym Adelmar Borrego and it has been streamed over 270 million times. A bigger problem is that we have become passive listeners. How so? To listen to millions and millions of songs, we are paying, say, for Spotify only Rs 119 a month (there are other plans). For Apple Music, it\u2019s Rs 99 a month. It makes us care less about the music that\u2019s playing, like that of Johan; it has become something that\u2019s in the background. It is different from the experience most of us grew up with \u2014 saving money to buy an album so that we could listen to it time and again. There was a time when listeners not only knew the background of a singer, they knew all that was published about musicians and producers contributing to an album. When we heard a new song on the radio, we would find out more about the artiste and everyone associated with that song. The problem is: Now, there is plenty of AI-generated music available online and people are listening to them already. Since we have become used to passive listening, we are alright with listening to music that doesn\u2019t have a discordant note. There is an AI version of Kanye West and there are AI-derived imitations of Drake and the Weeknd. If this music plays in the background all the time, will we complain? And if streaming services begin offering such music in copious amounts, are we going to turn down the volume? Who gets the royalty for such music? Who is the composer of this music? Is this a way to bypass composers? Making generation of AI tunes easy are apps like Suno (which launched on iOS in some markets a few days ago) and Udio. The output is not perfect to musically-trained ears but a casual listener doesn\u2019t get into the weeds. Guy Chambers, who has collaborated with Robbie Williams over more than two decades and whose co-writing credits include the multi-platinum hit Angels, recently said: \u201cI think we may get to a stage in the future where an album will need to have a badge saying \u2018this is an all-human record\u2019. From what I\u2019ve seen of AI, the acceleration is pretty terrifying, in terms of what it can do and how it could replace songwriters.\u201d He bluntly said that any person could put into an AI programme something like, \u201cI want a song 100 BPM that sounds like a cross between Abba and Arctic Monkeys\u201d. The comments come at a time when YouTube is experimenting with an AI system called DreamTrack whose users can type in keywords for a song. Charli XCX, Demi Lovato and John Legend are among artistes who have allowed their voices to be used by YouTube. Music labels care about royalty, so they are taking on apps like Udio and Suno through two new cases that have been filed in a federal court in Boston and the other in New York. Some popular music labels, including Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Records, are suing two of the biggest tech companies offering generative AI music-making tools that allegedly use work from artistes without consent. The lawsuits argue that Suno and Udio (developed by Uncharted Labs) have unlawfully copied the labels\u2019 sound recordings to train their AI models to generate music that could \u201csaturate the market with machine-generated content that will directly compete with, cheapen and ultimately drown out the genuine sound recordings on which [the services were] built\u201d. Some of the instances cited in the lawsuit show generated songs by Suno and Udio that sound like the voices of Bruce Springsteen, Michael Jackson and Abba, also there are outputs that sound almost identical to Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas Is You and The Beach Boys\u2019 I Get Around. Suno and Udio allow the usage of text prompts to come up with songs and have been successful in attracting users. Suno, for example, is available for use in Microsoft Copilot through a partnership while Udio has been used to create BBL Drizzy, a popular example of AI music going viral. Udio was founded last year by a group of former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant\u201d. AI\u2019s role in the music industry began to be discussed after a fake Drake song, generated using AI, spread through social media platforms last year. Now that AI systems are able to reproduce recordings that sound like known artistes, musicians are asking how much control they have over their AI deepfake likeness. In April, over 200 artistes, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves and Jon Bon Jovi, signed an open letter organised by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers and technology companies to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artistes\u201d. Of course, before AI stole the spotlight in the music industry, Auto-Tune showed us that there was nothing wrong with making pitch correction. \u2018Do you believe in life after love\u2019 sang Cher with AutoTuning thrown in, we lapped it up. The fear is: Will AI end up doing a better job than most artistes it is imitating? To get a Taylor Swift, there is an army of music industry folks grooming her over decades. But AI is saying: You can do something like that with a few text prompts.  Avatar-like pop stars such as Miquela haven\u2019t reached perfection but given time, they will reach a certain degree of refinement and resemble real performers.  When Ludwig von Beethoven died in 1827, he left behind some musical sketches of what could have been the \u201810th Symphony\u2019. In 2021, it was \u201ccompleted\u201d using an AI model that had been fed the 19th-century composer\u2019s entire body of work. It\u2019s too late to make a monster that was awoken in the 1950s when programmer-composer Lejaren Hiller\u2019s algorithm allowed a University of Illinois computer to compose its own music.  We all like tribute acts. There are Elvis Presley, Freddie Mercury, Michael Jackson and Bee Gees tribute acts who keep getting booked for parties and in Las Vegas casinos. We know they are not real but that doesn\u2019t stop us from listening to them. AI is making music and it\u2019s getting better\u2026 at least good enough to soon become a tribute act.",

        "Article Content": "When psychologist Paula David started her new job as a social worker in the Baycrest Centre, a Jewish home for assisted living for seniors in Toronto, Canada in the early 1990s, she had no idea what she was in for. Although she had been trained in group trauma therapy, the field of study was not as developed as it is today. Meanwhile, the 14 elderly women who met her regularly for group therapy were all survivors of the Holocaust from Eastern Europe. The women did not initially want to speak about their childhood and youth. \"In the beginning, they told me very clearly that they cannot tell these stories, that they had no words for them,\" said David. Instead, the psychologist spoke to the participants about their daily lives, their children and their grandchildren for a year. Over time, some of the women were showing early symptoms of dementia, meaning their earlier, traumatic memories were clearer than more recent experiences. Finally the \"dam broke,\" as David said once in a TV interview. Now that the women trusted her, she heard shocking testimony of human experiments, torture, the loss of children or other close relatives, of sexual abuse, terrible hunger, sickness and forced sterilization. Until then, these women had not even shared their stories with their closest relatives. \"It was the time before \"Schindler's List,\" David told DW, referring to the 1993 hit film that shone a light on the horrors of Nazi genocide against European Jews. \"One did not speak so much about the Holocaust. At the time the topic was still loaded with shame.\" Every now and then there were breakthroughs with the group \u2014 but also setbacks. \"Often we were overloaded,\" David said. \"Then we needed lots of cups of tea and spoke about other themes for some time.\" David began recording the reports and transcribing them at home. She realized that the participants, whose mother tongue was not English, used a syntax, melody and vocabulary that was completely different from those born in Canada. The language they used was \"infinitely more powerful than I could have expressed it,\" David said. She wrote down the sentences and organized them thematically. And in this manner, poems came into being which she presented to the group. The women could hardly believe they were listening to their own words. One said: \"I can't even write, forget composing poems!\", Paula David remembers. Realizing that these really were their own texts filled them with great pride. The poems gave the Holocaust survivors and David a structure, and they became kind of an emotional outlet for all of them. \"We became poets,\" the psychologist remembers. The group therapy sessions became such an important fixture in the women's lives that they worked family meetings and hairdresser appointments around them in order to be able to attend, David says. Many years later, in 2019, David met journalist and music producer Daniel Rosenberg. He was deeply involved with the story of Molly Applebaum at the time. Applebaum had experienced a similar fate as the women in Baycrest. In 1942, Molly began writing her diary as a 12-year-old. In it, she related how she had survived the extermination of the Jews in the Polish ghettos because she and her older cousin were hidden by a Polish farmer in a wooden crate that was buried in a stable. The girls could only leave the box at night. Often they were covered with insects, lice and dirt. Molly's mother was shot dead in a ghetto in Tarnow, and Molly never saw her younger brother and stepfather again. Molly's diary, \"Buried Words,\" was published in 2017. Today, she is 92 years old and lives in Toronto. Rosenberg decided to make a music album out of Molly's diary entries and the stories of the women at Baycrest. Not with English lyrics though, but instead in Yiddish and Polish \u2014 the languages that the women spoke as children and in their youth. The music would also have to match, so Rosenberg decided to work with Olga Avigail Mieleszczuk, a leading Polish tango expert. Before World War II, tango was one of the most popular music genres in Poland. It was infused with elements from Klezmer and Roma music. The era ended after World War II began. Its famous protagonists, lyricist Andrzej Wlast and composer Artur Gold, were both killed in Treblinka. Nine songs fill the album, \"Silent Tears: The Last Yiddish Tango.\" Four are originals from the 1930s, composed by Artur Gold. The rest are new compositions by Rebekah Wolkstein and Oscar Strock. The songs are interpreted by the Canadian chamber orchestra Payadora Tango Ensemble, and the accordionist Sergiu Popa. The texts by Applebaum and the Baycrest group are sung by Lenka Lichtenberg, Olga Avigail Mieleszczuk, Aviva Chernick and Marta Kosiorek. The Canadian singer Lenka Lichtenberg, who is originally from Prague, sings two songs. Lenka's mother and grandmother were prisoners in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, and her grandfather died in Auschwitz. In her 2022 album \"Thieves of Dreams\", she recalls the experiences of her grandmother after discovering her poems in a desk drawer in her former home in Prague. Lichtenberg recently won a Juno, the Canadian grammy, for her album. Lichtenberg is a professional, but \"Silent Tears\" was still a challenge, she told DW, especially the piece \"A Victim of Mengele.\" \"I have been singing since I was nine years old, but I had never heard such a horrible subject,\" she said. \"I asked myself: How can I sing something like this?\" For days she sat at her piano, \"tearing her hair out\", working her way into the song. Her goal was to find the right balance. As she says, \"To give the song the emotion that it needs without being overwhelmed by it.\" In the end she found exactly the right tone. In March 2023, \"Silent Tears\" climbed the charts and reached number 1 in the European World Music charts. International media outlets including Canada's CBC, Germany's Deutschlandfunk Kultur and Austria's ORF reported on the album. Music producer Rosenberg told DW how he and Molly Applebaum's daughter Sharon Wrock were more than astonished by this. \"Eighty years ago, when Molly was buried underground on that farm in Poland, keeping a diary of the horrors she was experiencing, Hitler controlled radio stations across Europe,\" he said. \"Now, Molly\u2019s words are being broadcast as music across those same channels in Austria, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Czechia, Croatia, Latvia and more. We both nearly broke into tears trying to wrap our heads around this.\" Meanwhile, the women from Paula David's original group at the Baycrest Centre have all passed away. But many other groups have evolved since then. David is happy that the Holocaust survivors have found a new life with \"Silent Tears.\" Now, the story of these women is being heard all over the world, in the languages the women spoke as children and in words that were forcibly taken away from them. \"Silent Tears\" is an important musical document. Especially today, with antisemitism on the rise again. Germany's largest folk-roots-world music festival, held in Rudolstadt, Thuringia, is now honoring \"Silent Tears\" with the Ruth world music award, which has been awarded annually since 2002. \"Silent Tears\" is an impressive testimony to Jewish culture as well as to Germany's past and its duty to remember the atrocities committed during World War II, said Bernhard Hanneken, artistic director of the festival. Poems and music take the survivors' stories to a new level and give the experiences and traumas reflected in the texts a deeply moving and often disturbing emotionality, he added. \"It is the merit of this project that it breathes life into these memories and poems and is able to pass on the messages they contain to future generations.\" The accolade, with \u20ac5,000 in prize money, will be awarded on July 6 in Rudolstadt.",

        "Article Content": "Saxophonist Benjy Sandler from the UK recently presented a night of jazz and post-bop at Skinny Mo\u2019s Jazz Club and he was joined by Arka Chakraborty on organ and piano while Arjun Chakraborty was on the drums. The trio took us on a journey through dystopic sounds from the avant-garde jazz era. From Arthur Blythe, Joey DeFrancesco to Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane, the trio captured their influences well. After the concert, Benjy chatted with  Tell us about improvisation in music.... There\u2019s always an exploration in music. Music definitely flows. Playing music and listening to it from the audience\u2019s perspective are different. There are times when it feels meandering but it\u2019s interesting to chase your thoughts. There are risks associated with improvisation where you try melody, resonance and dissonance. When I\u2019m playing I kind of think about it. I\u2019m intuitive and I play what feels right. I think about improvisation more consciously. Was tonight more intuitive or conscious? I was pretty much intuitive tonight. Other times, while I play I think of the things I\u2019ve listened to. I play something inspired by that. For example, Abdul Malik\u2019s music is what I go back to. It\u2019s heavily improvised and intensely groovy. By the second set, I tried to channel what excites me about his music. There was a kind of groove when you started the second set.... It started on a groovy note then it became more robotic. I managed to raise the intensity of the music by the second set. It felt a lot more intense in a good way. I was warmed up and felt myself playing things on a loop, which I thought added intensity to the set and a sense of familiarity. By the second set, I suggested that we start in a specific groove. That\u2019s the one thing that was pre-determined. We did play a piece by Willie Shaw in the end. How was your experience in the city? I loved the city; it\u2019s very unique. I like how a lot of things get refurbished and are preserved. I find that very interesting. I like the music scene here as well. What did you enjoy about the music scene here? There are plenty of venues to play live music in. I played at AMPM, Broadway and Little Bit Sober and all of it was great. There are plenty of good musicians. We went for a free improvisation session and that was good too. Calcutta is a city in India where there\u2019s space for free improvisation. Are you passionate about free improvisation? I look up to it a lot. I think free improvisation music sounds so unique. I can pull anything into it and expand it. We can go in different directions and manage to tie it together. I like composing as well. I just like being able to have a command over what the music sounds like which composing allows me to do. Do you feel that composing also helps you with the improvisation and they\u2019re connected in a way? Yes, they\u2019re definitely connected. I guess there\u2019s no right or set way to approach either composing or improvising. Composing kind of allows you time to think about what you\u2019re going to write whereas when you\u2019re improvising it\u2019s very much like you\u2019re in the moment. How was Skinny Mo\u2019s? It was amazing. I loved the venue and it allows quite a bit of creative music. I loved collaborating with Arjun and Arka. Arjun and I met in London and that sparked the trip to India. We decided to tour India and this is my first time here. I played in Pune, Mumbai and Guwahati apart from Calcutta.",

How was your experience in Calcutta? The experience was short but intense. Calcutta shows a completely different side to India. You\u2019d think you were in another time.... In the afternoon, the workshop at Skinny Mo\u2019s Jazz Club was enriching, as the students were themselves experienced musicians and we were able to tackle more advanced notions. And the evening concert was very warm in this magnificent hotel. I\u2019d like to come back to Calcutta for a bit longer. Your soundscape is quite unique\u2026 I listen to lots of different styles of music, from jazz to world music, including pop and classical, and I\u2019m also very attached to the music back home, which I listen to a lot. I think my music is made up of all these influences. What do you think of the jazz music scene at the moment? I think it\u2019s really interesting jazz and like all styles of music, it is evolving. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change radically because everything has perhaps already been done in recent years. I think it\u2019s important to maintain the traditions and fuse them with more modern music. Contemporary and modern jazz. How do you blend the two in your music? My music is based on traditional rhythms, in particular the cr\u00e9ole rhythms that come from R\u00e9union, Martinique and Guadeloupe, and on jazz, which I like to mix with more modern styles like pop. I\u2019m very curious about everything I hear around me, so my music evolves accordingly. What are some of your upcoming works? I\u2019ve got a new project called   in which I\u2019m a singer and bass player! I love discovering and learning new instruments and sharing music with new musicians, as is the case with  . It all feeds me. And your inspiration? Many musicians inspire me and I\u2019m always keen to discover new music. Travelling and meeting new people inspire me enormously. I hope to discover new lands. Jazz in France and jazz in Calcutta \u2014 did you find similarities? Like the French public, the Indian public is really incredible and warm. I feel that there\u2019s a very strong musical culture here. Indians seem to love jazz. I appreciate the Indian public for their kindness.",

        "Article Content": "John Mayall, the pioneering British bandleader whose mid-1960s blues ensembles served as incubators for some of the biggest stars of rock\u2019s golden era, died on Monday. He was 90. The death was confirmed in a statement on Mayall\u2019s official Facebook page. The statement did not give a cause or specify where he died, saying only that he died \u201cin his California home.\u201d Though he played piano, organ, guitar and harmonica and sang lead vocals in his own bands with a high, reedy tenor, Mayall earned his reputation as \u201cthe godfather of British blues\u201d not for his own playing or singing but for recruiting and polishing the talents of one gifted young lead guitarist after another. In his most fertile period, between 1965 and 1969, those budding stars included Eric Clapton, who left to form the band Cream and eventually became a hugely successful solo artist; Peter Green, who left to found Fleetwood Mac; and Mick Taylor, who was snatched from the Mayall band by the Rolling Stones. A more complete list of the alumni of Mayall\u2019s band of that era, known as the Bluesbreakers, reads like a Who\u2019s Who of British pop royalty. Drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie were also founding members of Fleetwood Mac. Bassist Jack Bruce joined Clapton in Cream. Bassist Andy Fraser was an original member of Free. Aynsley Dunbar would go on to play drums for Frank Zappa, Journey and Jefferson Starship. In his book \u201cClapton: The Autobiography\u201d (2007), Clapton described playing in the Bluesbreakers under Mayall\u2019s tutelage as a demanding but rewarding kind of musical finishing school. After leaving the Yardbirds and joining the Mayall band in April 1965, \u201cgrateful that someone saw my worth,\u201d he wrote, he moved into \u201ca tiny little cupboard room at the top of John\u2019s house\u201d so that he could better soak up all the lessons he wanted Mayall to teach him. \u201cWith long curly hair and a beard, which gave him a look not unlike Jesus, he had the air of a favorite schoolmaster who still manages to be cool,\u201d Clapton recalled. \u201cHe had the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen,\u201d and \u201cover the better part of a year, when I had any spare time, I would sit in this room listening to records and playing along with them, honing my craft.\u201d The one album that Clapton recorded with Mayall, \u201cBlues Breakers\u201d (1966), is often credited with kick-starting the electric blues boom of the 1960s among young Americans and Britons. With songs by Robert Johnson, Otis Rush, Freddie King and Ray Charles, as well as Mayall himself, the album provided a repertoire, arrangements and a thick guitar sound that would be widely copied by hundreds of bands in both countries. In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \u201cBlues Breakers\u201d No. 195 on its list of \u201cThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\u201d John Mayall was born in Macclesfield, England, just outside Manchester, on Nov. 29, 1933. His father, Murray, who played guitar in local pubs and collected records, and his mother, Beryl, stimulated his interest in music, but he trained as an artist and graphic designer at the Manchester College of Art and, after doing military service in Korea, worked for several years for advertising agencies. (He would later put that experience to use by designing the covers of many of his albums.) Mayall was already 30 when he decided to become a full-time musician and moved to London, where performers like Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies had already carved out a niche for the blues. Financially, it was tough going: Even when he had future stars like Clapton, Green and Taylor in his band, the Bluesbreakers followed a grueling routine of touring by van and playing short engagements on cramped stages in small clubs, often for audiences of only a few dozen people. But after guitarists everywhere took notice of the \u201cBlues Breakers\u201d album and its equally influential follow-up, \u201cA Hard Road\u201d (1967), featuring Green, Mayall\u2019s horizons expanded. He started touring regularly in the United States and Europe: \u201cThe Diary of a Band,\u201d a two-disc set recorded live in the Netherlands and other locales with Taylor, was released officially, and performances at the Fillmore West and in Germany and Italy eventually circulated in bootleg versions. In 1969, after recording the album \u201cBlues From Laurel Canyon\u201d and befriending members of the American blues band Canned Heat, Mayall moved to the Los Angeles area, where he lived for the rest of his life. That led to a fundamental shift in the composition of his bands, with British musicians giving way to Americans. His first \u201cAmerican\u201d group included Harvey Mandel on guitar and Sugarcane Harris on electric violin. Later units featured guitarists Sonny Landreth, Walter Trout and Coco Montoya, all of whom went on to successful solo careers. Mayall had already begun moving away from what Clapton called his \u201ctextbook blues\u201d style before coming to the United States, forming the jazzy, drummerless acoustic band that recorded \u201cThe Turning Point\u201d in 1969. In the 1970s, however, he would go deeper into, as the title of a 1972 album put it, a \u201cJazz Blues Fusion,\u201d working with jazz musicians like trumpeter Blue Mitchell and saxophonists Ernie Watts and Red Holloway. But Mayall never abandoned the blues altogether, and in the 1980s he re-formed the Bluesbreakers, with which he would continue to tour and record, with constantly shifting personnel, well into the 21st century. In some editions of the band, he was joined by alumni like Taylor and McVie; Clapton would occasionally play with him as well. In all, Mayall released more than 70 albums, the most recent of which was \u201cThe Sun Is Shining Down\u201d (2022). He also issued several DVDs, including one of a 70th-birthday concert in 2003 at which he was joined by many of his most prominent former sidemen. He is survived by his children, Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. His two marriages ended in divorce. It was announced in April that Mayall, along with his fellow blues artists Alexis Korner and Big Mama Thornton, would receive this year\u2019s musical influence awards from the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. In 1979, a fire destroyed Mayall\u2019s house in Los Angeles. Lost in that blaze was most of the record collection that had so impressed Clapton and other blues initiates, which by that time had grown to include thousands of discs, including many rare 45 and 78 rpm blues singles, as well as many of the live tapes Mayall had made of his own bands in the 1960s. In 2014, Mayall sat down for an evening-long interview at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, in which he reminisced about the challenges of being a crusader for the blues in London in the early 1960s. He recalled playing 11 shows a week in \u201cdens of iniquity\u201d and having to persuade McVie\u2019s parents to let their son, who was underage at the time, join his band. \u201cIt was extremely exciting,\u201d he said of those times. \u201cWe all felt we were part of the same family and that we really were connecting with people, a new generation of people, and also having a great time playing. You just continually played; it wasn\u2019t worth going home.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "Lori Umbrino saw her first Billy Joel concert at Shea Stadium in Queens in 1990. More than three decades later, she stood with her two children outside Madison Square Garden on Thursday evening, each wearing a T-shirt from the singer\u2019s concerts across the years. \u201cWe\u2019ve been there with him along the journey,\u201d said Umbrino, 51, whose shirt was from Joel\u2019s 100th concert at Madison Square Garden on July 18, 2018, designated Billy Joel Day in New York state. That journey has led them back to Madison Square Garden, where Joel was performing the 150th and final show of his 10-year residency  The milestone \u2014 and, for some, the devastating misunderstanding that Joel was retiring \u2014 drew veterans of his shows, first-timers, families and singles from around the city and the country. Thousands of people piled into the Garden to hear Joel glide from rock song to soulful blues. Stuart Stephenson sat outside the arena at 34th Street and Eighth Avenue, blowing into his melodica, fingering the keys to play \u201cNew York State of Mind\u201d and \u201cUptown Girl.\u201d Fans and commuters streamed by, hawkers sold T-concert shirts, and drivers planted their hands on their horns. Stephenson saw a news segment Thursday morning about Joel\u2019s concert, and thinking the Piano Man was closing his Steinway for good, he rushed into Midtown. \u201cI was supposed to play at Citi Field tonight,\u201d Stephenson, 55, said, referring to the ballpark where the New York Mets were playing the Atlanta Braves. \u201cBut I decided to come here.\u201d He was among many people who were relieved to learn Joel wasn\u2019t retiring. Ryan Tores flew in from Thousand Oaks, California, where he grew up listening to Joel\u2019s songs. \u201cHe\u2019s the one artist our whole family can agree on,\u201d said Tores, 21, who was attending the concert with his young sister and their parents. \u201cOne-hundred-fifty out of 150 seems special,\u201d Tores, said, adding that the event might call for \u201crare songs and deeper cuts,\u201d like \u201cSleeping With the Television On\u201d or \u201cAll for Leyna.\u201d Simmi Degnemark, 55, wore a shimmery shirt \u2014 \u201cAt a Billy Joel concert, I got to look sparkly\u201d \u2014 but decided to buy a concert T-shirt for $10 outside the venue. Perhaps the night would call for an outfit change, she added. Hours before the show, tickets on resale websites were priced at more than $700 for the nosebleed section. \u201cAnyone selling one ticket?\u201d Jared Belson asked concertgoers heading toward the entrance. Belson turned 40 in January and wanted to celebrate by seeing Joel live, a chance he thought might never come again. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go to Billy Joel show,\u201d he said. But as 8 o\u2019clock drew closer, Belson\u2019s concert dreams were smoldering. He approached a group of three people in their 20s, who were also on the hunt for a way in. \u201cSomeone please give me a ticket!\u201d Jenna Devellis, 24, called out with her arms in the air, one of which was inked with a tarot card and the words \u201cTHE FOOL,\u201d an homage to the song \u201cVienna.\u201d She got it last June, her first and only tattoo. As she and a friend scrambled for tickets, a digital poster of Joel flashed on a sign above Penn Station: \u201cThe Final Show of the Record-Breaking Residency,\u201d with the words \u201cTonight Sold Out\u201d below it. Paul Kurian and his family shuffled forward on the line toward the entrance to Madison Square Garden, chatting about whether Joel might bring out a special guest. \u201cWho could it be?\u201d Kurian, 48, who had traveled from Fredrick, Maryland, with his family, wondered. \u201cHe might just not have anybody.\u201d In the end, they were not to be disappointed: Axl Rose showed up to perform with Joel. What more could you ask for on a Thursday night in New York?",

        "Article Content": "The blues, it is universally accepted, is immortal. So, in the passing of pioneering British musician and band leader John Mayall, whose ensembles of the 1960s acted as incubators of this essentially African American musical form, the blues lived once again.   \u201cJohn Mayall gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain,\" said his family in a Facebook post announcing his death early this week. That immediately took me back to the Calcutta of the \u201980s when some of us had just finished school. Presidency College, hallowed for its academic record down the ages, was the setting for my initiation into Mayall\u2019s music, courtesy seniors with acoustic guitars, in-between statistics classes.  , with its infectious opening swipe, was the song.   That was Eric Clapton playing electric guitar on the album, Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton, affectionately referred to as the \u201cBeano album,\u201d the debut record (1966) of this Mayall band. And we, like the rest of the world, were merely trying to emulate. For accomplished musicians of this country, Mayall has always been a benchmark. A rite of passage, just like it was for guitarists Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Taylor; drummer Mick Fleetwood, bassists Jack Bruce, John McVie and many others.  Ehsaan Noorani, the guitar arm of the Mumbai music composing trio Shankar- Ehsaan-Loy, fondly recalls how his first blues album was in the form of a cassette recording of Mayall\u2019s Jazz Blues Fusion, which he reckons is one of his finest. Arinjoy Sarkar of Calcutta\u2019s Arinjoy Trio reminisces about his meeting with the legend himself in Mumbai at the Mahindra Blues Festival where, would you believe it, they were both slated to perform. Ditto for Rudy Wallang of Shillong\u2019s Great Society and Soulmate, whose world of guitar heroes exploded with Mayall\u2019s influence and who bumped into the legend at the Jakarta Blues Festival. Guitar guru Amyt Datta opens up about the British blues invasion and how the lines distinguishing it from its American counterpart were being blurred with Mayal and Co.    The memories are vivid. As always, the music is precious. Listen in. \u201cI have always maintained that Mayall was one of the most progressive blues musicians (I think he even had an album called Progressive Blues). He was always pushing the envelope with the form of the blues, not necessarily sticking to the 12 bar thing, which he did earlier on when he was with his own band,\u201d says Noorani, calling in from Chicago where he is unspooling after a very successful series of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy concerts. He admits he still transcribes music from Mayall\u2019s Jazz Blues Fusion album, a compilation of three concerts, side A featuring a gig in Boston in November, 1971, and side B a selection of tracks from two concerts in New York in December of the same year.   Aside of the \"Beano album\", Noorani\u2019s go-to Mayall albums are Blues From Laurel Canyon, Jazz Blues Fusion and A Hard Core Package. \u201cIn Hard Core, he had guitarist James (Quill) Smith, who is really fantastic. If you hear the album, you\u2019ll realise it\u2019s out of the blues format. But it\u2019s still like a blues album. He always had these musicians whom you\u2019d never heard of before. As a result, his music always took on a very fresh sound, whatever the album.\u201d Arinjoy Sarkar found himself thinking \u201cend of an era\u201d when he heard of Mayall\u2019s demise. \u201cHe was one of those stalwarts who helped in the transition of the blues to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, even though there were people like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley before him. But I always saw him as one who was able to bring the rock \u2018n roll grit into the blues,\u201d he says thoughtfully, explaining why he holds Mayall so dear to his heart. \u201cHe showed us all a new way of playing the blues.\u201d The Calcutta guitarist remembers meeting him in Mumbai in 2018 at the Mahindra Blues Festival which Mayall was headlining. \u201cThat was the year we won Band Hunt, because of which we were scheduled to play two half-hour slots. We met at the customary meet and greet before opening day. \u2018We must hear you play,\u2019 he told me when I was introduced to him. Unfortunately that did not happen, but as I shook his hand, I still remember thinking, \u2018Man, this guy gave Clapton a break\u2019. \u201d  A lot of pictures were taken, but sadly Arinjoy doesn\u2019t have a copy. \u201cFor all of us guitar players, I guess the 'Beano album' has been the go-to standard,\u201d says Arinjoy, whose playing is tilted more towards the American side of things. \u201cI am more of the 1950-\u201960s Freddie King, Albert King, Joe Louis Walker kind. But whenever I have to channel a bit of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, I look to Mayall.\u201d Three of his songs that have left an indelible mark on Arinjoy form the core of lessons he\u2019s designed for his students:   (Otis Rush cover,  opening track),   (side A) and  . \u201cI go back to them time and again. So Mayall's playing has to be somewhere there inside of me when I am playing.\u201d Wallang owes a lot to John Mayall.  \u201cIt was because of him that we got to hear the greats like Eric Clapton and Peter Green, who were all my inspirations. Back in the day when I was with Great Society and we used to travel across the northeast, there would always be at least one Mayall CD in our car. He was a big part of our lives,\u201d he says. Circa 2012-11, Wallang\u2019s band Soulmate is at the Jakarta Blues Festival, where, lo and behold, the legend is there too! \u201cWe got to meet Mayall right after his sound check. And that was a blessing.\u201d Like all aspiring guitar players, Wallang too started off playing the blues and trying to copy the greats like Buddy Guy, Freddie King and Albert Collins. \u201cAs a 15-year-old, I would play a lot of Clapton, little knowing then that he also came from the blues and Mayall\u2019s band.\u201d Wallang remembers playing  , knowing it then as a John Mayall song. \u201cIt was only later that we found out it was a cover of the Otis Rush song. There is another song we still do today. It\u2019s called  . And it\u2019s so relevant even now. I just love the song and its message. It\u2019s one of the staples in our setlist.\u201d For Wallang, it is very important to have his own voice. \u201cI am not that much of a singer, even though I do sing. But I think I sing better through my guitar,\u201d he says. A guitar player\u2019s search for his tone is a work in progress. But Wallang believes that after all these years, he has been able to learn from all these greats and \u201cfind my own voice\u201d. What was unsaid but implicit in this assertion is that somewhere deep within that confidence lay the legacy of a John Mayall. Amyt Datta sees John Mayall as iconic for the manner in which he was able to bring the blues into the mainstream. \u201cHe was one of the first British White guys to sort of adopt the blues and make it ready for people\u2019s ears. His 'Beano album' was path-breaking in the way it introduced Eric Clapton. We used to play a lot of Clapton, his songs with Cream, Derek and Dominoes and must have also played a few Mayall numbers.\u201d On British and American Blues, Datta explains it simply. \u201cThe soul is the same but the mind is different, if you know what I mean,\u201d he says, attributing this cross pollination to the advent of the Beatles in America and the American blues into Britain. \u201cThis crossover led to the lines getting blurred.  American bands started imbibing punk, while the British musicians took in the blues. The stories and the themes were the same, but the British band presentations had a flavour of rock, while the Americans were \u2018bluesy\u2019 blues.\u201d Born in the \u201960s, Datta remembers experiencing this during his early playing days. \u201cWhen I was growing up this whole influx thing had already started. I was born into the blurred line,\u201d he says, referring to the fading distinctions in the various styles of the practitioners of the blues. \u201cBefore that, till about the late \u201950s, you could spot the line. You could tell an American blues player. Soon after the music really got crossed over, which to my mind, was a good thing to happen.\u201d In his heartfelt tribute to his mentor John Mayall, Eric Clapton calls him his surrogate father. \u201cHe taught me all I really know and gave me the courage and enthusiasm to express myself without fear or without limit.\u201d For legions of musicians who have been influenced and inspired by the godfather of British blues, it is a time to reflect on the musical boundaries Mayall crossed, the lines Mayall helped blur. For what is the British Blues without the American Blues? The cross-pollination of style, technique and substance that Mayall helped forge within the secular traditions of the blues has left us with even richer musical experiences. Both Amyt Datta and Ehsaan Noorani agree. \u201cWhen Clapton plays the blues you can hear more elements of rock. It\u2019s the same with, say, a Rory Gallaghar, even though, now, the blues and rock are married so tightly that you may find it difficult to identify one from the other. The rock music of Allman Brothers cannot exist without the blues elements,\u201d notes Datta. Noorani talks of the manner in which British musicians recognised this form of music and made it popular for the artistes from the USA. \u201cYou know Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Albert King, BB King and Jimmy Hendrix himself. Suddenly, these artistes became big. They got recognised by US promoters as well. From playing in small dives and juke joints, they became stars that played at the Fillimore and even bigger venues. So it was very crucial in the way the British gave this music the recognition it needed,\u201d he explains. In the UK, thanks to Mayall and Co., even the Rolling Stones and Fleetwood Mac started off as blues bands. \u201cThese guys took the music and interpreted it in their own ways. They would do covers of songs of the American artistes, but in a way that would lead to bands like Cream and Eric Clapton becoming \u2018God\u2019, he adds, referring to, among others, acts such as Ten Years After, Chicken Shack, Savoy Brown, all big bands that were part of the British blues explosion. Ultimately, as Datta put it, this free flow of musical ideas that flowered within and beyond the tenets of the blues, is the embodiment of a simple but profound assertion that in the end, it really doesn\u2019t matter if you are Black or White. It\u2019s the music that keeps shining through. And we have to thank John Mayall for that. : Why is it called the \u2018Beano album\u2019? Look at the cover and you\u2019ll see why. Clapton is reading the British comic book.  ",

        "Article Content": "As the rain pours down and steaming cups of tea rule our lives, Armaan Malik, the music industry\u2019s heartthrob, has surprised fans with a song of heartbreak.  , composed by Amaal Mallik, was released a few days after the singer\u2019s birthday (July 22) and it has gathered praise from all \u2018Armaanians\u2019. Over a Zoom call with t2, the 29-year-old spoke about singing a song of heartbreak after a long time and working with his brother Amaal. Excerpts. Belated happy birthday Armaan. How was it? I had a great birthday. I spent it the way I always wanted to. What does   talk about? , in a nutshell, talks about the eternal wait for a lover\u2019s return. There are many heartbreak songs. Even the word \u2018 has been used in plenty of songs but what makes this special is the somberness in the audio and video. It talks about the pain a guy feels. He feels isolated. Even though he\u2019s trying to come close to her, circumstances and everything else are pulling him back. This is what the song is about. It talks about the deep pain incurred by a heartbreak. And I don\u2019t think a lot of my fans have heard me in this zone in a very long time. My last heartbreak song was in a movie called  . I sang  there. And I had done a single long back called  , which too is a heartbreak song. But after that, it was all super romantic, in-love kind of songs.  is a good change for me as I\u2019m stepping back into the zone after a long time and I\u2019m eager to know what fans think because they\u2019ve been waiting to hear me in something like this and see me in this kind of an avatar. At this point in life, you probably don\u2019t relate to the song... That\u2019s the beauty of songwriting. You can make up scenarios and think of ideas and concepts that may not necessarily be relatable to you at the moment but can be very relatable to someone going through a breakup or who is in an  moment for their lover to return. When you make music, you have to talk about relatable emotions that speak to people; it doesn\u2019t necessarily always need to stem from a personal space. Do you and Amaal (Mallik, the composer) always hit it off? It\u2019s always amazing to team up with Amaal. We\u2019ve had numerous hits together. Ever since we made our debut together in Bollywood, we\u2019ve, I think, probably crossed 50 or 60 songs together. It\u2019s still a beautiful feeling though. Even today, when I enter the studio and I\u2019m singing Amaal\u2019s composition I\u2019m scared because he always puts me through a different test with each song and I come out a better singer after finishing those sessions.   is a song that we\u2019ve been working on for quite some time now. And added to the mix is Kunal Verma, who is another special collaborator of ours. We\u2019ve worked on   before,  . Lots of songs we\u2019ve done together, which we loved working together. This trio \u2014 Amal, Kunal and I \u2014 brings out the best in me as an artiste. I always learn so much from my brother whenever I sing for him. It\u2019s beautiful to come back to a collaboration with Amaal and, of course, Kunal. What do you expect from your fans? They are already reacting very positively. On all my social media pages and accounts, whatever I\u2019ve posted so far for the song, everyone commented that \u2018the OG Armaan is back\u2019. I think it\u2019s because they\u2019ve waited for this kind of sound for a long time. In the last two or three years, I kind of focused on making English pop music and Indian pop music, which have a different sound. But a lot of my listeners missed me in this kind of a zone, this kind of a song \u2014 proper soulful stuff that I was known for. For example, songs like  ,  . I think even fans feel that it\u2019s some sort of a comeback to the OG zone. That\u2019s the common comment that I\u2019ve been receiving so far. I hope that people are resonating with the number. I\u2019m pretty sure that everyone who has heard my songs will pick this up. What was the big turning point in your career? I have many turning points in my career. I started as a child artiste. The first turning point was participating in   at age nine. The second turning point was my debut in Bollywood films as a child singer... in   for the song  . Then I was launched in   by Salman Khan sir and it was my debut as an adult playback singer. Then it would definitely be the moment in 2020 when I shifted gears from Hindi to English music and put out my first English song \u2014  . There have been many other milestones as well winning the European Music Awards twice for my songs. I can\u2019t talk about just one major turning point. All of these are contributing milestones and turning points for me.   comes at a pivotal moment... when I have kind of stayed away, especially from the Hindi music zone, for the last few years and I feel like this is my comeback into this zone. I\u2019m very excited. You\u2019re going to hear a lot of my songs, a lot of my non-film songs in Hindi, my English stuff and international collaborations will also be there.   is a big turning point for me. Are you collaborating with international artistes currently? There are many but I\u2019ll keep it a secret for now and surprise my fans. Recently, I collaborated with British singer Calum Scott and opened for Ed Sheeran in Mumbai. I sang   on stage with him. There are a bunch of other collaborations that I\u2019ve lined up and, hopefully, in the next six months to a year, you\u2019ll see all of those come to life. In future, I would like to work with Charlie Puth and if Justin Bieber comes back to making music... definitely with him. From   to now: How would you define your journey? I won\u2019t be able to comprehensively tell you in one line. Years of hard work have gone into building who I am and what I am today. I was eight years old when I started singing in a studio and then nine when I participated in a reality show and then   happened. There was no looking back. I knew that this was something I was born to do. I\u2019m grateful for all the opportunities that have come my way. Obviously, there have been struggles and hurdles in my career but I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s life is without struggles. When you\u2019re in the entertainment field, the only problem is that your struggles are before the public, but others can be private about their struggles. I think that is difficult to navigate for a lot of people, but I think I\u2019ve been able to do it and come out shining. I hope to continue making good music.",

The lawsuits were filed in June by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), a group representing major record labels like Universal Music Group (UMG), Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Records.  The two startups allow AI music generation through text prompts. According to the RIAA, some of these tracks contain vocals that sound identical to those by artistes like Bruce Springsteen, Michael Jackson and ABBA.  The companies have said the lawsuits highlight the music industry\u2019s opposition to competition, according to  . \u201cHelping people generate new artistic expression is what copyright law is designed to encourage, not prohibit,\u201d Udio wrote in its filing. \u201cUnder long-standing doctrine, what Udio has done \u2014 use existing sound recordings as data to mine and analyse for the purpose of identifying patterns in the sounds of various musical styles, all to enable people to make their own new creations \u2014 is a quintessential \u2018fair use\u2019 under copyright law.\u201d  Meanwhile, Suno said that major record labels had misconceptions about how its AI music tools work. \u201cWhat the major record labels really don\u2019t want is competition,\u201d Suno wrote in its filing. \u201cWhere Suno sees musicians, teachers and everyday people using a new tool to create original music, the labels see a threat to their market share.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "On Tuesday t2 broke the news of legendary Canadian singer Bryan Adams set to perform in Calcutta on December 8 this year at Aquatica. Since then, the city has been abuzz with the news that has excited people across age groups. Earlier Bryan Adams had announced his five-city India tour as a part of his   world tour on July 26, and to the disappointment of his fans, it didn\u2019t feature Calcutta. But how did things change and who made it possible? t2 caught up with Rajdeep Chakraborty of Whats in d Name Live, Anshul Chauhan of Rhythmbox and Kinjal Bhattacharya of The Festival \u2014 the guys who managed to put Bryan's Calcutta concert as the opening gig of his India Tour. This is huge! Congrats on such an achievement. How did it happen? In a city like Calcutta, which has been starved for years, been ignored and neglected for years of international talents of this level, it was a goal for all of us as event organisers, to provide an event that actually brings this entire city together. That was the motivation behind it and yeah, I guess we somehow manifested it, the opportunity came our way and of course, the partnership worked and we aligned it together. How did you feel after you guys went live with the news? How has the response been? It\u2019s just gone crazy because Calcutta was not there when the India tour was announced about 10-12 days back... everyone messaged, I\u2019m not exaggerating... about 120-200 people probably messaged just saying, 'Thank you'. So it just makes you understand how much this meant to people, because you need to understand here we are not talking about just an artiste or a generation... I think even what we call the millennial crowd today, when they go for, let\u2019s assume, a New Year\u2019s Eve party, they listen to  ! It is played without fail. So you can understand the kind of emotions associated here. And for the first time ever something like this has happened to me... the 60-year-old fathers of my friends have contacted me and have started enquiring about ticket prices and stuff like that... it just shows you the entire age group Bryan Adams caters to. It is so varied.  The feeling is still sinking in! Rightly so... I think it is also because you have been trying to get Bryan Adams since 2006... I was a second-year engineering college student, a die-hard Bryan Adams fan. I made one of my friends send out an email to him on April 26, 2006... that was the first time I professionally reached out to Bryan Adams... after a couple of email exchanges I realised that the city does not have any infrastructure to make this show in real life. In 2006, nothing really existed in terms of events... may be apart from one Bangladeshi band and one Pakistani singer. Nothing remotely existed. At that point in time, we were amateur fools. We had no clue how to do it, how much money is required, but we were that bunch of, you know, fans. So I kept on doing my research about this gentleman and I tried to figure out how he had such an influence... I had even heard a rickshaw puller and taxi driver have   as their ringtone! So, from there to here, we made several attempts... in 2017, we were this close to getting him. As in, he had already made out the teaser post that he had uploaded but then deleted later. Calcutta was not yet ready psychologically to make it happen at that point in time. The local ecosystem was not ready. I have been speaking with Rajdeep about this since 2016. For the first time, three major events companies dealing with rock (The Festival), EDM (Rhythmbox) and Bolly-EDM (Whats in d Name Live) have come together to make an event so big. How did this unison happen? The entire process of Bryan Adams from stage one was initiated by Rajdeep. He got in touch with us. Of course, he (Kinjal) has been putting in the work for years. So obviously it was his baby and Rajdeep also had the offer on the table. I think they spoke and then he got in touch with Rhythmbox and offered us a meeting saying, 'Let\u2019s talk about it'. We heard about it and yeah, one thing led to another. We kind of discussed the pros and the cons of the event, the ins and outs.... then we calculated our commercials and most importantly I realised that it\u2019s a good team, it\u2019s a strong team and we don\u2019t clash in our genres... and the main motivating factor was Calcutta! But hasn\u2019t there been any clash of ideas, rivalry or clash of egos? Nope. That happens when your market is massive and you\u2019re fighting over the market. Here in Calcutta, the market is not massive so it requires us to come together, and grow the market and maybe someday it will be very big enough where you know we will be able to do our own individual Bryan Adams show and we won\u2019t need each other. What made you say 'yes' to Bryan Adams? You have a history of getting big EDM artistes like DJ Martin Garrix, DJ Snake, Afrojack... Within the first three minutes of my conversation on the phone with him, I knew that I was joining him and it was only a matter of how to convince my partner (Dhruv Todi). It\u2019s very simple you know, the reason I started doing events in Calcutta was very different. In 2016 I was going to Goa to attend a festival in December, where airfares, stay, and ticket prices were sky-high and on that flight, I saw a half of Calcutta travelling, so I thought, why can\u2019t we do something in our own city? That time we had a partner with us on board and of course that person motivated us, did all the hard work to get us the first show (Armin van Buuren)... the majority of it of course is my partner\u2019s credit and after that, further events have been done successfully. For this, I didn\u2019t put my head into Bryan Adams until the Bryan Adams tour was announced. When I saw that Calcutta was missing out, my whole purpose of starting to do this was for Calcutta. With Calcutta missing it went again to the thought of why every city gets a taste of an artiste but not Calcutta. Everyone who lives in Bengal is so musically inclined and talented. An artiste like him deserves a concert in Calcutta. For example, if you do a Dua Lipa it\u2019s going to be very tricky... but Bryan Adams, being the daddy of music, initially was not coming to Calcutta. And then I got in touch with Davis Cup legend Jaidip Mukerjea who put me through to Mahesh Bhupati who has the rights to the India tour and things followed.  After I got the confirmation from Mahesh, I went to Anshul, and then I called up Kinjal and told him to meet me as I had a surprise for him. I told him that this was from one Bengali to another... because I knew what he had done and tried. 'Here you go, I have the confirmation, we are bringing Bryan Adams to Calcutta!'  He is 64 and still going strong. What do you think makes him relevant even now?  He is still coming up with one album after another every two years. Even though he is 64, he is physically much more active than others. His lifestyle is completely different. He is one of the best in portrait photography as well, which is why he is so relevant. Even though he is 64, the kids are also listening to him. His music is also evolving with the generation.  I think the most important thing is music. Summer of \u201869 released in 1985!  His music is soulful, timeless and lyrics-driven. Everyone can connect to his songs. And because of the love the artiste has, it\u2019s more like generations passing it on. Grandfather to father and the father\u2019s child is listening to him, so it goes on... His music will never get old. Generations will come to hear it, and couples getting together and forming new relationships, will be listening to his love songs. They don\u2019t make love songs like that anymore, they don\u2019t make rock music like that anymore. Everything has changed now. So it\u2019s something that\u2019s always going to remain sacred to people. And they have formed their memories with this artiste, which you can\u2019t fight. Memories are something you can\u2019t fight. Nostalgia is something that you can\u2019t fight. So there\u2019s been huge nostalgia value. So I\u2019d say a mix of the nostalgia and the classic timelessness of his music makes him relevant. What can Calcutta expect on December 8?  We are talking about an artiste of this magnitude... there is going to be a production that you have never really seen for a live show. This will be the biggest event in the history of Calcutta. 8,000 kgs of usable equipment will be flown in for every show.  They are coming in a 35-50 charter. After this show, Calcutta will always be a part of any national tour that is being planned. You will be at par with any big promoter in Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore. Everything is super-sized. From the artiste to the production to the setup to the marketing to the collaborations all across the country to the promoters, it\u2019s all supersized. What is the tentative footfall that you guys are looking at?  About 10,000 to 12,000. What has been the response to ticket sales on Zomato Live?  Phenomenal! Tickets got sold via Zomato Live, which one can access via the Zomato app and once you open it, you will find the option below. Our tickets were priced at  1,969 (starting price), keeping in mind Summer of \u201869! So, we have three categories, there \u2014 silver, gold and platinum at the moment. The tickets went live on Wednesday and in nine minutes we sold out the Early Birds. Then very shortly in due course we will launch the Diamond lounges (VVIP) which will be a standing lounge where you will have your ticket plus alcohol included and you will get an elevated platform view. That aside, do you have any opening act planned?  So Kinjal and I had a discussion where Calcutta being Calcutta, having the rock influence that it has, definitely we want to kind of integrate the local culture of the rock bands here and have a line-up that will open for him. : We will shortlist and give it to his team... whoever they approve will get a chance. What are you going to do when you meet him? I am going to touch his feet and take blessings of course... he\u2019s had a big influence on my life, and my girlfriends and he has been the background music for a lot of things (grins). Just watch him and soak in this aura.  Bryan Adams aside, what\u2019s happening in 2024?  In September, we have Alan Walker lined up, who is one of the most popular DJs in the world. And yet to announce a second Sunburn event for the end of November with yet another number one. We have Vishal Mishra on September 13 and another massive secret project where we are in talks for, in February next year and hopefully, touchwood, that will also materialise. He is a global artiste... very popular and recently came to India.  I am also working very closely with a couple of famous Punjabi singers. One is currently very much trending and another artiste has become a global sensation.  We usually do events every day. Events of all scales for corporates, schools, and colleges. That is our bread and butter. We were trying to get blues and the pop bands. We are in talks with Evanescence. We have an offer from Megadeth... Lastly, you guys broke the mega news of Bryan Adams performing in Calcutta, exclusively to t2. What makes t2 a favourite?  I think not only from events, I can speak from an outlet point of view also. Back in the day, I used to own an outlet which was there for eight-nine years. I think there has been no one other than t2 who has covered my outlet. Yes, that\u2019s true. Not a single news channel or anyone has covered it. Out of that, six years back-to-back we got The Telegraph Food Guide Awards. So, I think it\u2019s a very confident association I have with this brand.  I think you and I first connected with our very first concert \u2014 Afrojack in 2015 and it was in association with t2 since our first concert. And I know you through that, personally. From then to now, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done an event without you. So, like I said, it\u2019s the number one publication in Calcutta, most read, and of course there is that familiarity.  It's been about 18 years of association. Michael Learns to Rock, Infected Mushrooms to Poets of the Fall, t2 has been our natural partner. The reason being, I think t2 takes music more seriously than the other competing publications. My community who are live music fans follow t2 because they get to know about the international music, party scene, Bollywood and local music as well from it.",

        "Article Content": "On July 30, Sonu Nigam turned 51 and in the 46 years of his career in music, he\u2019s given us songs we\u2019ve loved, laughed with, and cried to, and his dulcet melodies never fail to jolt you out of your reverie. He is synonymous with high energy on stage and even now he\u2019ll pull off a Ab mujhe raat din or an Abhi mujh mein kahin, or a Papa meri jaan with equal dedication and energy \u2014 catering to the billions who call themselves his fans across the globe. Recently, on a US tour, the singer chatted with t2 about his journey and more. Excerpts. From your first album to the countless playbacks in the music industry\u2026 how do you reflect on your journey? Thirty-three of being in Mumbai and 46-plus years in the profession of singing, I am overwhelmed with gratitude. When did you start singing? Singing happened as organically to me as speaking and listening happens to humans. I was born with music in my head and before I could realise it, I was singing on stage. My father Agam Kumar Nigam and mother Shobha Nigam, both singers, made sure that there was enough music discussed and heard in our house. As a child did you dream of becoming a musician? Music was such an integral part of my being that I always wanted to be something else. I thought of myself as a scientist when I grow up, or an IAS officer at different points of my life. What does turning 51 mean to you? It amazes me that I have actually reached a remarkable number in terms of age and, thankfully, people say that I am aging gracefully. I think it\u2019s because I have come to a beautiful and sound understanding with the Universe and that keeps me balanced and joyous, and more than anything else, connected from my within. When you started anchoring Sa re ga ma, how did you develop the confidence and screen presence? I always feel the Universe has a magnificent way of setting the game plot for everyone individually according to their individual capacity. I was quite knowledgeable about songs of all eras due to upbringing and keenness despite having not received formal classical music training. On the other hand, due to my academic inclinations and the numerous books I read throughout my childhood, I was grammatically very sound and had a good hold in both Hindi and English. Both these qualities made me decently qualified for hosting Sa re ga ma. And I saw myself getting better with every episode and every season. Recently you concluded a tour in Australia. What\u2019s your most memorable takeaway from it? I have been to Australia before, too, but never performed at the Sydney Opera House. As fate would have it, the first time I performed in the Opera House also happened to be the first time a singer has done two back-to-back sold out concerts in a single day. It\u2019ll forever remain as one of my most memorable days professionally. Which project do you think was the biggest turning point of your career? I never got anything overnight and suddenly, one thing led to the other and brought me where I am standing today. But if I have to say Sa re ga ma, put me in the household of India and I\u2019m very thankful that something like that happened to me besides the legendary songs that have come my way. After Classically Mild, are you working on any album? I did a very unconventional album called Music Room with the amazing percussionist Bickram Ghosh. It wasn\u2019t meant to be a Deewana but had some really interesting experimental music meant for the people who understand taal and chords. I guess with the change in technology, albums are replaced by singles. But I am not against the idea of an album. Maybe in the future. What are your upcoming projects? I have sung a lot of songs for a lot of upcoming movies. Then my brothers Salim-Sulaiman\u2019s pet project Bhoomi 24 has my songs. Also, Bhushan Kumar is very keen on a Deewana 2. In your life, who has been your biggest inspiration, musically and otherwise? I have been inspired by a lot of people from different walks of life. Some popular some unknown. Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, K.L. Saigal, Mukesh, Manna Dey, Talat Mahmood, Michael Jackson, Ghulam Ali, Mehdi Hassan, Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan, Ustad Salamat Ali Khan, Suresh Wadkar, Hariharan, and many more in music and Osho, Javed Akhtar, Yogananda are few of the many names I admire as thinkers. When you go up on stage \u2014 what\u2019s your go-to concert wear? What are you more comfortable with? I like wearing loose clothes that don\u2019t make me too warm on stage as my performances are anyways very high energy that end up making me sweat profusely. Among the young stars, who do you think has great potential to rise and shine? I truly love Arijit Singh. What\u2019s your thought on the indie music scene of the country? Do you have some words of inspiration for them? Indie music scene is shining these days. I\u2019m very happy for the young talents who have managed to carve their own niche and are commanding their own audience. Well done. How do you usually like celebrating your birthday? How did you celebrate it this year? I love being with my people on my birthdays. I like to do the things I love on birthdays like riyaz, workouts and I\u2019m happier when there\u2019s a concert or a recording. This year was memorable as my team from Artium Academy released a short film based on my experience in Dubai for a concert early this year. Lots of my colleagues from my fraternity came to be with me. I was so touched. I met a lot of my well-wishers who came from all corners of India, both at the venue and at my house. I even ended up recording for Mithoon Sharma before going to the dinner my brothers had kept for me. So, all in all, it was a wholesome birthday.",

        "Article Content": "Ayaan Agnihotri, aka Agni, has mesmerised us with his debut track Party fever (composed by Payal Dev), featuring Salman Khan (in a cameo), and is ready to drop another single, titled You are mine, composed by Vishal Mishra, and sung and written by Agni (rap) and Salman. After the foot-tapping Party fever, You are mine will be on the romantic side, coming with Hindi and English lyrics and two rap sections that add a fun twist. Party fever gathered over seven million views on YouTube. Will Agni attract more fans with his upcoming single? Here\u2019s what he told  What is   about? The song is composed by Vishal Mishra, and written and sung by Salman Khan. I feature in two sections of the song \u2014 a rap in the middle and one at the end. It\u2019s a love song that blends beautiful Hindi and English lyrics. It has a sweet melody. How was it working on both   and   with Salman Khan?  is composed by Payal Dev, and sung by Payal and me. Salman   had a \u201ccameo\u201d in the song. In  , he\u2019s the lead singer and lyricist. It has been great working with him. Seeing him live in action is inspiring. He has taught me tricks about appearing in a music video. Has the love song been inspired by a story? Almost all the songs I make are inspired by some aspect of my life. Yes, a few aspects of the song have been inspired by real-life experiences. What\u2019s next after  ? I\u2019m focusing on releasing new tracks every month. The next numbers are English tracks, composed and written by me. It\u2019ll lead up to the launch of my EP. Why do you switch between Hindi and English? English is what I speak predominantly. I think Hindi is harder to write in. I find it easier to write in English and it becomes easier to connect to the rest of the world. Hip-hop and R&B are my main focus and I\u2019d love to incorporate elements of jazz into my music. How did you get into music? Music is a passion. I\u2019ve been writing and composing for 10 years now. I started writing lyrics when I was in the 11th standard. That turned to writing and composing music. Who are your favourites in the Hindi music industry? When it comes to music production, I really love Aditya Dev. I\u2019ve never seen someone so dedicated. In terms of talent, Vishal Mishra impresses me. I\u2019ve been to his studio and have heard him sing unreleased songs; he is phenomenal. From the making of  , what are some memories you\u2019ve made with Salman Khan? Salman   is very affectionate, but his way of showing his love is tough. It\u2019s tough love and he shows it with good intentions. He absolutely loves to see us grow up and, having gone through hardships, he makes sure that we\u2019re prepared for the future. He wants us to learn from him and his life... and wants us to grow. What plans do you have for the Bollywood music industry? I think music transcends barriers and languages. I\u2019m open to making quality music. But I don\u2019t want to get stuck into making just commercial stuff. Any woman musician you want to collaborate with? I\u2019d love to collaborate with Raja Kumari (American rapper and singer).",

If you like  , Spotify sort of says, \u201cHere\u2019s more  -like music for you.\u201d For an \u201cun- \u201d song to have access to your ears, something like a lottery ticket has to be won. We are sure that it\u2019s not just algorithms that help users discover new music on Spotify, there is also an editorial team that helps build custom playlists, especially when it comes to new artistes. Yet, the sameyness of largely algorithm-driven music cannot be overlooked. In fact, this is being felt more and more as traditional destinations of music recommendation are slowly disappearing. The music magazine  , responsible for chronicling some of the best alternative acts of the 21st century, is now a part of   with a reduced staff strength. Metacritic too moved from one owner to another, losing loyal users along the way. Take the example of Bandcamp where artistes could sell directly to fans with minimal overhead and it was home to a fantastic editorial department. Epic Games bought it in 2022 and sold it the next year to Songtradr. A great way to escape algorithmic cages is by building communities to celebrate diverse patterns of music consumption, the same way independent radio stations used to focus on telling stories. So how can you discover new music? \n       More of a game, Music League requires users in a \u201cleague\u201d to submit a song to a playlist. It\u2019s an interesting format to ensure you get to hear new songs. Each time a new playlist appears, voting begins and so does fun. The comments on the songs are perhaps the best part of the game. Think of cinema. A film like   releases and 400 people visit a plex to watch it. After a few hours, they leave debating the film\u2026 a healthy debate. Or think of the time when there was an explosion of music websites and also a crop of journalists who encouraged users to discuss music. Algorithmic discovery keeps offering the same of what you already like. Add country star Luke Combs to a playlist and you know what\u2019s going to happen. Music streaming services largely tend to keep listeners in a bubble unless you decide to potter around the service on your own. Music League allows users to join a public or private league and each round generates a playlist. The admin for the group decides the number of songs each person may submit for a round and the story behind the picks that make this very interesting. It\u2019s a celebration of what music is supposed to do \u2014 share the unheard. Music League is not a replacement for how MTV played music videos in the 1980s and \u201990s or the way   found new musicians but it\u2019s a step in the right direction. \n       No, that\u2019s not AirPods! The widget allows a peek into what your friends are listening to. When we discover a new song, usually we send a link over Messenger to besties, like here\u2019s Artemas with his  . The Airbuds widget simplifies the process. After downloading the app, set up an account and link your Spotify or Apple Music subscription. The widget then needs to be added to the phone\u2019s home screen. Invite a few friends to join in and when they listen to a song, it will show up in the widget along with their profile photo. You may want to dive into the next song your friend listens to and later get on a call to criticise/celebrate. \n       It\u2019s one of the largest music databases online. The idea behind RYM is to make you discover new artistes and tunes by browsing new releases, top charts going back to the 1960s or a list of genres. And the special feature? Custom playlists from other users that are far more detailed than what you get on Spotify. \n       It\u2019s a private Facebook group that\u2019s easy to join \u2014 make a request. The admin requests are simple: Be respectful, no reposting, no spamming and be specific with your playlists. With over 365,000 members, the group is constantly getting requests. Users post their inspiration and attach a brief explanation of their interest in the theme. And then begins a discussion. At a time when social media is home to angry news, this is a peaceful corner. \n       Think of this as a jukebox in your mailbox. The number of journalists delivering researched music news is on the decline but the ones who are passionate about their job continue to make recommendations that are worth a dekko. Take the case of The Amplifier from Lindsay Zoladz. We have millions of songs at our fingertips but Zoladz cuts through the noise with her recommendations that are delightful. Also, try Jeff Tweedy\u2019s Starship Casual. The prolific Wilco frontman talks about his years on the road and what makes his favourite songs so great.\u2028 \n       While writing this piece I listened to O.P. Nayyar\u2019s work for the film  , AC/DC\u2019s   and The Beatles\u2019  , all made possible by this unique website. Founded in 2012 by a group of four DJs, it offers a selection of songs for each decade dating back to the 1900s.",

        "Article Content": "British guitar legend Eric Clapton posted an emotional video message on his social media about John Mayall, the godfather of British blues whose passing away became public on Wednesday. \u201cI want to say a few words about my friend John,\u201d began Clapton, who has been synonymous with electric blues guitar since the 1960s.  \u201cI want to say thank you, chiefly for rescuing me from oblivion and God knows what. When I was a young man around the age of 18-19, when I decided that I was going to quit music, he found me and took me into his home and asked me to join his band,\u201d a visibly emotional Clapton said. \u201cAnd I stayed with him, and I learned all that I really have to draw on today in terms of technique and desire to play the kind of music I love to play. I did all my research in his home in his record collection for the Chicago blues that he was such an expert on. And I played with his band for a couple of years\u2026\u201d Playing in John Mayall\u2019s band, Clapton said, \u201cwas a fantastic experience and he told me that it was OK just to be. Play the music you wanted to play more without dressing it up or making anybody else like it. Whether it mattered whether they like it or not to listen to myself, to my innermost motivations. \u201cAnd he was my mentor and and as a surrogate father, too, he taught me all I really know and and gave me the courage and enthusiasm to express myself without fear or without limit.\u201d Clapton, who battled addictions for a major part of his life, struck a note of regret.  \u201cAnd all I gave you in return was how much fun it was to drink and and womanise; when he was already a family man and I wish to make amends for that. I did that while he was alive. And I had obviously since learned that that is not the best way to carry on. ButI shall miss him. But I hope to see him on the other side. So thank you, John. I love you. And I'll see you soon. But not yet. Not yet. As they say in the Gladiator movie,\u201d the guitar great signed off. ",

        "Article Content": "More than three\ndecades ago, in 1990, a young boy migrated with his family from Pakistan to\nIndia. The Maheshwari family, originally from Karachi, laid down their roots in\nJaipur, and their four-generations-old textiles business flourished in the\nwestern state of Rajasthan.  The young boy, Vinesh,\nhowever, would choose to forge his own path; he went on to become a\nfirst-generation jeweller in the Maheshwari family, founding Mireya Jewels and\neventually gaining, as clients and well-wishers, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the\nAmerican elite \u2014 including Susie Tompkins Buell, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Cindy\nCrawford, Roma Downey and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  Twenty years ago,\nVinesh met the man with whose vision he would feel a kinship \u2014 Kundan Lal\nVerma, the master craftsman who hails from a family that has specialised in\ntemple jewellery for three generations.  And thus was born an\nartistic bond unlike any other \u2014 a collaboration out of which emerged a range\nof jewellery fit for the gods. Many of the pieces from the collection were part\nof the star exhibit this year at the preview of  , CIMA\nGallery\u2019s highly-anticipated annual lifestyle exhibition that features the best\nof Indian craftsmanship, from it dress materials, sculptures, jewellery, bags,\naccessories, home decor and tribal art to sarees crafted by master\nweavers.  \u201cWhen I learnt that we\nwere coming to Kolkata to showcase our jewellery, especially the temple\njewellery so beautifully visualised and created by Kundan Lal  I saw\nit as an opportunity to highlight India\u2019s rich history of ornaments, gems and\nart,\u201d said Vinesh. He also described the veteran jeweller as \u201cone of India\u2019s\nbest designers of temple adornments\u201d whose piety and artistic skill go hand in\nhand. Kundan Lal, it so happens, is a longtime devotee and visitor of the Karni\nMata temple in Deshnok, Rajasthan; in fact, as Vinesh revealed, \u201cKundan Lal  \ncreated the   for the goddess with 100-carat diamonds.\u201d The preview also\nfeatured a fascinating discussion helmed by the multi-faceted artist Sujoy\nProsad Chatterjee, who not only asked the master jewellers about their\nexquisite creations but also linked the history and art of jewellery with\nquestions of masculinity, gender fluidity and the prevalence of patriarchal\npractices. The session was introduced by the chief administrator of CIMA,\nPratiti Basu Sarkar, who set the tone for Art in Life 2024 when she said, \u201cBe\nit high art or \u2018poor craft\u2019, at CIMA, it is all equal, it is all art.\u201d Indeed, the\nrepresentation of \u201call of India\u201d is what Art in Life is all about, and one of\nthe facets of the exhibition that the director of CIMA, Rakhi Sarkar, strives\nto uphold every year. \u201cAs always, we have taken great care in curating Art in\nLife this year, and bringing the best of the best from India\u2019s states to you,\nbe it Rajasthan or Bengal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are so proud to have an institution\nlike Kundan Lal Verma with us, as well as Vinesh Kumar Maheshwari, whose\njourney is both fascinating and remarkable.\u201d \u201cIn my years of\ndesigning jewellery, I have learnt something every day, and continue to do so,\u201d\nsaid Vinesh. \u201cJewellery making is not just an art, it\u2019s also an area of deep\nstudy \u2014 you discover something new all the time.\u201d And what about Kundal Lal?\n\u201cHis creative vision is stunning,\u201d says Vinesh, before the senior jewellery\ndesigner chimes in. \u201cIf anyone comes to me with an idea,\u201d he says with a smile,\n\u201cit is my promise that their vision will be brought to life, and it will be  \u2014 unlike anything else!\u201d ",

        "Article Content": "Luxury isn\u2019t about the product. It is about the experience. This theme became the focal point for The Luxe Lifestyle Forum 2024, a confluence of the industry\u2019s leading brands, organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC), on September 4, at Taj Bengal.   brings you key takeaways from a panel discussion on \u2018Luxury Redefined\u2019.  Moderated by  , a long-time entrepreneur in the food and travel industry, among other roles she holds, the session had eminent speakers from the ICC Ladies Study Group \u2014 Glenburn Tea Estate and Boutique Hotel managing director,  ; SHE Kantha director and former LSG president Malika Dudeja Varma; and Denmark consul general, Bajoria Financial Services managing director, and Ganges Art Gallery chairperson, Smita Bajoria.  Karen opened the discussion by reflecting on her own journey while starting out in the luxury food business, and how it has evolved since then. \u201cI started with the singular goal of bringing about quality, not luxury. Interestingly, today luxury isn\u2019t about brands, but quality,\u201d she said.  Husna also shared how she accidentally stepped into hospitality by falling in love with a tea planter, and  . \u201cWe had a simple vision: to replicate the grand life of tea planters from back in the day. In 2005, some journalists from the UK stayed with us and placed us within the top 101 hotels in the world! When I asked them why they liked us so much, they said quaintness, privacy and attention to detail are the true luxuries that the world wants. In keeping with this need for connection, we don\u2019t try to train our staff by the rulebook. It is the innate hospitality coming from the Nepali community that our guests love,\u201d said Husna, adding that over the course of their stay, guests would often form deep connections with the staff.  By extension, she also addressed the global fear of Artificial Intelligence replacing humans in their jobs. \u201cThe one thing AI will not replace is the feeling of sitting in a beautiful space and enjoying a cup of tea over a lovely conversation.\u201d This exclusivity remains Glenburn\u2019s biggest draw, with 60 people looking after just 16 guests, and their capacity being restricted to eight rooms.  Malika also emphasised how SHE-Kantha got the basics right as it travelled from mud huts to the design capitals of Milan, Paris and Venice. \u201cLuxury is always about design, along with beauty and exclusivity. Even if we use luxurious materials, our products will feel empty unless they retain the intricate design and handiwork of artisans, customised for more contemporary outfits,\u201d she said.  Smita added that things had transformed from when she started. \u201cBack then, there were no galleries in Kolkata. Today\u2019s youth is exposed to all kinds of experimental and abstract art. There are serious buyers who research the artists and have developed an instinct over what will appreciate in value,\u201d she said.   She also expressed her optimism over how the luxury space would continue to grow with the growth of India\u2019s economy. \u201cIndian art has come of age in the last few years. Artists who took three decades to command a crore have been able to double their price in just a couple of years. It is also an indication that the country is doing well, as the elite buy art not just for visual appeal, but as an investment,\u201d she explained.  Malika experienced a similar trend in her industry, with global support for  artisans during the pandemic. \u201cConsumers are now more conscious and are willing to pay a premium for authentic craft. Saris, where the artisan has spent two years making them, are selling for lakhs. Today, we have 1,000 women artisans with us,\u201d she beamed.  Husna agreed that this economic boom had extended to hospitality too, with tastes of young India changing rapidly. \u201cPeople are learning to appreciate the finesse in experiences. Rather than sitting in an air-conditioned jacuzzi in a five-star hotel, they want to help their children do homework amidst a forest,\u201d she smiled.  Husna also identified Sienna Store & Cafe\u2019s \u2018  as a key example of changing trend, with consumers increasingly opting for the freshest high-quality local produce over generic imported ingredients. \u201cPrices in luxury are commanded because of trust that quality will be extremely high. Malika was one of our first customers two decades ago. If she returns today, she needs to feel that the quality has remained the same, else the trust will waver,\u201d she said.  Karen lauded many such artisanal local experiences in Bengal, adding that there was a dearth of their pan-India presence. \u201cFrom  [ ] to smoked hilsa to  , this city has such a rich wealth of tradition and art that isn\u2019t available anywhere in India. It must be spread around the country,\u201d she said.   She also shared an anecdote from 25 years ago to show just how low the bar used to be. She had started making artisanal jams for a huge conglomerate. \u201cOne day, I got a call from the MD. They had found foreign objects in my jam.\u201d Obsessed with quality, she immediately flew to Bombay for a personal meeting. \u201cThe MD looked me in the eye and in the name of \u2018foreign object\u2019 took out an orange slice from the jam. They were so used to flat pastes, that they didn\u2019t know a marmalade was supposed to have natural ingredients. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t have bits of fruit in a jam today, customers won\u2019t trust you,\u201d chuckled Karen.   Smita shed light on how the game isn\u2019t about immediate gratification, but consistency. True appreciation can only happen when galleries take on the responsibility of helping artists. \u201cGallerists need to work closely with artists, because their entire future depends on how the gallery markets them. Only when visibility is created over decades, is there trust within the buyer.\u201d   Nidhi Burman, senior assistant director, ICC, signed off: \u201cBringing together global leaders, innovators and local talent to redefine the luxury market of Eastern India was both challenging and rewarding. We aimed to create a platform that not only celebrated exclusivity, but also pushed the boundaries of what luxury means.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "Art in Life, the annual lifestyle exhibition at the CIMA\nGallery is a journey through Indian art, encapsulated in three rooms of lively\ndisplays. From the hand-printed fabrics of Odisha to the Dokra statues of\nBengal, the exhibition upholds the rich cultural tapestry of India through the\nhandiwork of its artisans. With a focus on the artforms of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh\nthis year, the exhibition intends to focus on \u201cshifting the perspective of\nviewers to the lesser-known intrinsic art forms of India\u201d. A large part of this\nyear\u2019s exhibition is the tradition of temple jewellery. Attending the event was Sujoy Prosad Chatterjee, actor,\nfashion designer and stylist, showing off a signature neck piece with an\nequally gorgeous ring. Pratiti Basu Sarkar, the chief administrator of CIMA,\nhailed him as a \u201cmultidimensional hero of the city\u201d. For Chatterjee, \u201cArt in\nLife is a display of the harmony of humanity through art.\u201d A three-day display of the creations of Mireya Jewels, based\nin Rajasthan, stood out at the preview, especially the pieces inspired by\nIndian temple jewellery. Founder Vinesh Kumar Maheshwari, as part of his\ninaugural speech, said, \u201cThere was a high demand for temple jewellery. People\nwere inspired by the gods and goddesses wearing these designs, and brought it\nto us. We wanted to incorporate these designs into ordinary everyday life.\u201d \nWhat is at the heart of Art in Life? Director and curator of CIMA, Rakhi\nSarkar, told  , \u201cRather than having the artists set up stalls\nand hope for a sale, we invest in them directly. We ensure that they get their\ndeserved compensation. A sari takes six months to weave; what is the right\nprice for such a work? These are priceless works, and we at CIMA try to support\nthe weavers as much as possible.\u201d The exhibition also features a variety of south Indian\nsilks, master weavings and silk scarves among textiles. Dokra statues of\ntraditional Bengali gods accompany south Indian brass and bronze products for  .\nAtop them stands Nataraj in metal, caught in a moment of his  The walls of CIMA are occupied by a variety of\nwall-hangings: masks featuring   and  from Cheriyal\nand beyond, framed paintings, and little mirrors set in intricate\nwooden frames. They overlook hand-painted statues and ornate chairs featuring\nhuman and animal figures in tribal motifs. Staying true to its motto of\nrevising the way art is seen, the exhibits blend modernity with tradition.\nShirts for men, jackets and blouses for women feature traditional prints while\nretaining the utility of everyday use. There is also a display of a wide range\nof bags of various sizes, made for everyday use with traditional prints. As part of her address at the inauguration, Rakhi Sarkar\ntold the audience how the gallery was started in 2000 to represent all of India\nin this little space. \u201cThis initiative has grown over the years, and every year\nthe focus is on a particular region of India,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, at Art in\nLife, some remain constant, like the south Indian states, Bengal, and\nRajasthan. These products are not commercial, but meant to preserve the dying\nartistic forms of the country. Some of the products on display are unique\npieces made for the exhibition, with no duplicates.\u201d  Also present at the event was Kundan Lal Verma, a veteran\ndesigner of temple jewellery, who has collaborated with Mireya Jewels for many\nof the pieces that were on display. The duo presents a variety of accessories,\nfrom vibrant neck pieces to subtle wristbands as part of the exhibit. Verma\nhimself attended the event decked out in gorgeous pieces. Sujoy Prosad\nChatterjee upheld Verma as an example of how such accessories do not just\nbelong to women, and emphasised the need for men to bring back this culture in\nsupporting India\u2019s jewellers. \u201cPart of Mireya\u2019s initiative is to create both minimalist\nand maximalist jewellery that can be comfortably worn by men, not just women,\u201d\nsaid Maheshwari. \u201cThese would not just go with traditional outfits, but also\nwith western wear.\u201d Art in Life is heavily supported by the Ladies Study Group,\nwhose president, Minnie Juneja, called it \u201cone of the most anticipated\nlifestyle events\u201d, highlighting how CIMA makes art democratic and inclusive\nboth online and offline. For her, it blends the visions of ancient and modern\nIndia, bringing art, history, and literature together under one roof. Of the\nmany art forms, the Bengal   style and Tanjore paintings stand\nout the most. Serving trays featuring Durga with her family in the Kalighat  \nstyle accompanied gold jewellery with Tanjore art at their centre. Art in Life offers Kolkata a unique shopping experience that goes on to support India\u2019s rich cultural tapestry. The exhibition is happening at CIMA Art Gallery till October 9, right as Durga Puja arrives in the city. ",

        "Article Content": "\u2014 Naveen Kishore,  A dimly lit room and black walls with abstract photographs and a few excerpts of poetry. The setting at the performance space was dream-like \u2014 warm tones and a crimson light focused on the mic and the man at centre stage. In the spotlight, stood Naveen Kishore, delivering one of his best performances as a poet. The experimental poetry recitation of Naveen\u2019s debut book  , an evening enhanced by Jivraj Singh helming the soundscape, took place in Experimenter, Kolkata, recently. Listening to Naveen Kishore\u2019s recitation was like travelling through time back to Kashmir, his childhood, and his life around his mother. Standing in the middle of the performance area, the music and the play of light and shadow assisted the poet to express love, longing, and loss. All the excerpts from the book were held together with a common feeling \u2014 grief. The glimpses of memories through the observing eyes of Naveen painted fragments of pictures for the audience, taking them to the moments that inspired the words. The other key motif was memory and remembrance \u2014 someone gradually losing their ability to remember and their near ones grasping at what\u2019s fleeting, trying to memorise passing moments. \u201cPast, present, future tends to merge in our work that renders memory into jazz. Standing there in that theatrical space with spotlights surrounding me in different intensities, the black box, the audience in the dark, the void makes my words directly interact with Jivraj\u2019s improvised music and everything else stops mattering. One only looks into the void and finds the original muse, the one who I write about \u2014 my mother,\u201d Naveen observed. Who would have known that the soulful voice of K L Saigal, when layered with birdsong could create poetry? Jivraj Singh, a musician known for his experimental soundscape, was a devoted artist, accompanying Naveen that rainy evening in Kolkata.  The duo have previously performed in a similar arrangement of poetry and music coming together. Jivraj\u2019s preparation to curate the soundscape involved listening to Naveen express his thoughts and reading his poems. \u201cIt has been a long series of collaborations, I would say,\u201d said Jivraj, adding that it began even before they started working together on this project. \u201cJust spending time together, having conversations, and also just sitting quietly established a good shared mental space that helps when making art together.\u201d  The music was not simply background score but a key element of the evening along with Naveen\u2019s verse. With the surprising chime of bells or the notes of flowing water, the soundscape was serene yet surprising, caressing the audio-sensory perceptions of the audience, creating a unique experience. Also intriguing was the constant hum \u2014 a base note that accompanied the words and on which the soundscape was built.  \u201cMy poems are made up of \u2018sound images\u2019. I am not sure which comes first, the image or the sound. These are written but only after I have begun to \u2018hear\u2019 them. The chamber of my head tends to respond, resonate, be inhabited by the sound each word embodies,\u201d shared Naveen, when asked about the amalgamation of poetry with sound as a medium of expression. His collaboration with Jivraj Singh made an \u201cintuitive sense to explore my spoken sound with his soundscape,\u201d said the poet.  This coming together of two creative minds was also the coming together of three generations \u2014 Naveen\u2019s mother in his poetry, Naveen, and the young artist Jivraj. \u201cThe music he (Jivraj) creates is enough for grief to find its way into our embrace. Being enveloped by Jivraj\u2019s soundscape the words begin to take on meaning \u2014 their own and mine. It doesn\u2019t really matter as long as they strike a chord in the mind of the listener,\u201d added Naveen. It is important to talk about the stillness among the audience \u2014 as if preparing to face resolved and unresolved emotions through the ebb and flow of prose and symphony \u2014 even before the performance commenced. Ruffles of pages between the poetry from  , long sighs of relatability accompanied the poet as he read excerpts from his book. Among the audience were actress Tillotama Shome, and colleagues of Naveen including Sunandini Banerjee and Bishan Samaddar, among others. The audience represented a diverse age group with college and university students to senior citizens. Anyone in the audience that evening noticed the rootedness in Naveen\u2019s recitation. It was as if he was speaking to his past and all that was left behind \u2014 unsaid notes to the muse. ",

Birla Sabhaghar was an initiative to showcase young talents from Calcutta and beyond. The festival commenced with a sitar recital by Mehtab Ali Niazi.

Bhowmick wants to send out the message that we should think twice before swatting insects because repulsive though they are, they do us a world of good. However, his light-and-airy, serio-comic drawings of these critters equipped with vampirish gnashers that often make life intolerable for human beings make the case for their annihilation stronger. Bhowmick presents a parade of such bugs and he gives each of them a character of its own. There are deadly mosquitoes, cockroaches, bed bugs, caterpillars, maggots, flies, centipedes, and chrysalises of various kinds. All of them are equally repulsive. However, it is not easy to conjecture from their contorted facial expressions whether they are angry or hysterical with mirth. A good number of these pests are drawn on either white or bottle green sheets of paper with black or white lines. Bhowmick depicts them in all their fascinatingly ghoulish details. But for their fearsome dentition, they could be fairies with gauzy wings. Their forms are so delicately delineated with the lightest of touches \u2014 stippled with infinite care and with limbs worthy of  tendrils \u2014 and caught in fey poses that could make ballerinas go green with envy. Some insects are elegantly painted with daubs of silky turquoise and pinks. One of these is curiously painted on a vinyl extended play recording of a Mohammed Rafi song. Two of the largest paintings are apocalyptic visions of the invasion of giant bugs that tower Godzilla-like above skyscrapers (picture). The sky is a bright red with multistoried buildings encircling the horizon. Above it are giant bugs floating like monstrous blimps. The stuff of nightmares indeed.",

        "Article Content": "The seemingly unassuming title of the show,  , does not prepare viewers for the multi-sensory experience that is in store for them at Experimenter, Hindustan Road. Even before one\u2019s eyes get used to the darkened gallery where Tenzing Dakpa\u2019s solo show (on view till July 27) is set up, the olfactory sense is stimulated by a smoky smell and the ears catch fleeting sounds of a crackling fire. In this dark, cavernous space, illuminated by spotlights are Dakpa\u2019s photographic works,  and the eponymous  . The former documents the various stages of a man-made forest fire in Goa \u2014 there are tracts that are completely charred, the fire snaking across the landscape, and areas of dry kindling waiting to be set alight. What makes the viewing of these photographs eerie \u2014 besides the smell of smoke and the constant refrain of forest sounds such as animal calls, crickets, and twigs snapping underfoot \u2014 is that the images have been shot not in perfect light but in dark with the harsh, searching light of the flash illuminating certain parts, leaving others pitch dark. In these dark spots, the black pigment ink has accumulated on the acid-free paper to imitate the visual effect of soot and to give the impression that the landscapes are suspended in nothingness. Dakpa has further crumpled these prints with his hands, leaving them creased and undulated like a forest floor carpeted with dry leaves. The photos are dramatic in their stillness \u2014 the fire, the foliage are all frozen in time \u2014 with the acrid smell and soft sounds creating an ominous atmosphere.  In Weather Report, too, a fleeting moment in time across a seemingly innocuous landscape is captured by the artist. Dakpa abjures the modern-day obsession to train high-powered lenses to shoot a scene in granular detail. His style is more impressionist and natural: some details stand out while others are blurred in no particular order. These large scenes are comprised of many small prints pinned together like a pointillist work. The edges of each print fold and bend with the breeze animating the otherwise unstirring landscapes.  Dakpa\u2019s photographs capture a moment on the precipice of a catastrophe. Along with the scent of smoke, the questions that linger in the minds of the viewer are these: can the fire of the Anthropocene be put out and is there hope of regeneration?",

University, Baroda, in collaboration with the Kolkata Centre for Creativity), curated by the cultural theorist, Nancy Adajania, deftly sidestepped these templates by abjuring both the thematic and the chronical approach while revisiting the works of the master artist who was known for his pluralistic vision. At a time when Indian democracy stands at a crossroads, Adajania chose to focus on the strong political ele\u00adments in Subramanyan\u2019s work. More\u00adover, to situate Subramanyan in the history of Indian art and explain his seminal influence on it, the curator included in the exhibition some of Subramanyan\u2019s teachers as well as students. This created a fascinating montage \u2014 of art in newly-independent India, of Kala Bhavana\u2019s influence on Indian art, of the intermingling of indigenous traditions from across the country and of the role that gender played in shaping the sensibility and the vision of an artist. Among the works that captured Subramanyan\u2019s political philosophy, the most striking was perhaps   (picture, left), drawn in 1993 as a response to the communal Gujarat-Bombay divide. Significantly, Adajania included the artist\u2019s works for children, such as  , a book written and illustrated by Subramanyan, in which he offers a stinging parable of democracy gone wrong by narrating and illustrating the story of a princess whose autocratic rule brought nothing but suffering to her people (a response to the Emergency). Cut-outs from this title and of Robby, a character from Subramanyan\u2019s books who is thought to be the artist\u2019s alter ego, were blown up in size and pasted all across the walls and the floors of the gallery, guiding the viewers\u2019 path. The inclusion of what is often dismissed as being intended for children is important because the experience of seeing the country turn into something that was not envisioned at Independence made Subramanyan aware of the need to communicate his ideals to the next generation. In this context, children of present-day India might benefit immensely from his book,   (mock-ups from which were on display, picture, right). The show also highlighted just how versatile Subramanyan was \u2014 be it his hurried strokes on postcards, his signature reverse paintings, toys he made for the Fine Arts Fair or his famous marker pen works on paper, his gouaches and his murals, the exhibition covered a wide arch. What tied these diverse media together was the inherent sense of drama in the vision of an artist who revelled in the charm and the charisma of the historical arts of India. In each frame, one could rediscover the artist-pedagogue who could keep up with the world as well as preserve the cultural identities of the many characters that visited his works.",

        "Article Content": "Sursangam thoughtfully assem\u00adbled a clutch of Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s songs from a collection called  that dovetail into poetry and grouped them thematically. The event took place at Sisir Mancha recently under the title,  . While the recitations were sometimes long and not dramatic enough, the keyboard and the background music by the experienced Debasis Saha punctuated the sequences with a foundational sense of rhythm and brought in a breath of fresh air.  The renditions were slightly uneven owing to the flicks and the tremors of the vocal lines and the piano accompaniments not being precisely in sync. However, the two performances that stood out were \u201c \u201d by Indrani Saha and \u201c \u201d by Moushumi Bando\u00adpadh\u00adyay. Both singers showed finely honed prowess, skipping through light falsettos and keeping pace with the percussion. Bandopa\u00addh\u00adyay\u2019s seemingly faultless grasp over the intricacies brought in the first genuine applause from the audience.  Veteran Debarati Shome\u2019s \u201c \u201d had some smouldering moments where she elongated certain bits \u2014 this is a skill which comes with maturity. Her \u201c \u201d, on the other hand, was bold and insistent, but stopped just a notch below being full-throated. Swapan Shome kept an even pace with \u201c \u201d, although his voice often strayed into uneven paths. While the duet by Swarup and Swati Pal, \u201c \u201d, had moments of awkward compromise and those in which their voices clashed, they sounded melodious. Swagatam Das (tabla) and Debasish Haldar (esraj) supported the singers ably.",

        "Article Content": "In the exhibition,  , held at A.M (Art Multi-disciplines), the installation artist, Pradip Patra, and the curator, Ayan Mukherjee, offered a compelling commentary on the essence of ownership in the middle-class experience. Patra\u2019s installation, a seemingly decrepit hen house, metaphorically juxtaposed the idealised notion of wealth with the stark realities a common person faces. This visual dissonance evoked a sense of disenchantment, questioning the value society places on material possessions. Mukherjee\u2019s accompanying video featured friends and family candidly discussing their perceptions of possessions. This narrative approach bridged the gap between high art and everyday life, making the theme relatable to a broader audience. The installation and video collectively underscored the often-overlooked perspective of the middle class within the art world. Printouts, primarily sourced from the internet and kept at the exhibition, posed straightforward questions such as \u201cWhat are the prized possessions in life?\u201d and were followed by detailed elaborations. These reinforced the exhibition\u2019s reflective nature, inviting viewers to ponder their lives and challenge societal norms that define value and worth. Patra\u2019s work, detailed in Antara Dey\u2019s conversation with him, delved deeper into the psychological implications of possessions. It explored how identity and societal status are intertwined with what we own and how the loss of possessions can lead to an existential crisis. This dialogue highlighted the philosophical underpinnings of the installation, emphasising the transient nature of material wealth and the enduring value of intangible assets like memories and relationships. The curatorial intervention of   did not merely display art; it engaged viewers in a dialogue about their lives and societal constructs. It forced a confrontation with the often uncomfortable truth that in our quest to acquire, we risk being defined by our possessions or, worse, being possessed by them.  merged visual art with personal narratives to create a space for reflection and discourse. Patra and Mukherjee succeeded in making the abstract tangible, inviting every visitor to ponder their own place within the delicate balance of possessing and being possessed.",

        "Article Content": "Cal\u00adcutta may offer little to youngsters trying to innovate in the theatre space and explore newer modes of creative expression but there are surprises galore. Interestingly, most of these come from the suburbs. Budge Budge Agami\u2019s  (picture) is a perfect example. Scripted and directed by Ebong Ipsita, this experimental piece premiered at the Tripti Mitra Sabhagriha. Set in a mofussil town soon after the partition of Bengal, this intense relationship drama has an exciting premise. A postmaster (Suman Saha) and his newly-married wife (Ipsita) are troubled by the tumultuous political situation around them. Two other young men (Arghya Roy and Saumyajit Adhikary) keep coming in and out, teasing the minds of the audience, till the mystery is resolved at the end. Letters, passionate and puzzling at times, form the backbone of the narrative. While the flexible set is manoeuvred well by the actors, it is Saikat Manna\u2019s imaginative light design \u2014 a sensitive amalgam of shades and silhouettes \u2014 that scripts success for this immersive watch. Mounted with care and executed with love,  is 70 minutes long and I wish a long run for this production. The director/actor, Ipsita, has many talents.  Speaking of amalgams, Kayadanga Sabuj Sanskritic Kendra works out a challenging script by juxtaposing Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s play,   (1912), and Lu Xun\u2019s story, \u201cDiary of a Madman\u201d (1918). Visually arresting and aurally exciting, the production, titled  , explores the unknown fears and nightmares that crowd our personal space, represented by the characters from the famous texts. Rajesh Debnath, the director, is always open to new prospects in scenography. Here, he negotiates with projected images, innovates with prosthetic make-up and controls the light sources seamlessly to come up with a stunner. Pritam Chakraborty and Udipta Bhuiya share the acting honours.  In this context, it must be mentioned that Calcutta urgently needs a few black-box theatres with state-of-the-art facilities and a seating capacity of 150-200 people. Ramshackle proscenium theatres or reoriented lecture theatres can neither facilitate the intimacy our young practitioners love to explore nor accommodate the latest technological tools that they find handy. Time is running out. Corporates should step in at once.",

        "Article Content": "Bengali theatre\u2019s un\u00addying love for Shakes\u00adpeare continues to grow stronger with each passing decade. We are at a juncture of time when millennials are beginning to make way for Gen Zers to begin their tryst with the bard, as is evident from the recent spurt of Shakespearean plays mounted by theatre groups populated by young artists. A case in point is 10th Planet\u2019s  directed by Sharanya Dey, in which the cast and crew consist entirely of young people. Dey has used Utpal Dutt\u2019s translation of   as the source text but has edited and altered it considerably. The most significant modification is to have the two principal characters of Macbeth (Sharanya Dey) and Lady Macbeth (Mary Acharya) bear the narrative \u2014 although, much abridged \u2014 load of the play, with the other characters mostly performing choric roles. The ploy of rationing the characters works to an extent because what is left of the human order in   apart from the two towering protagonists can be evoked through suggestions and references. However, not actually having the witches on stage does reduce the play significantly \u2014 the witches are germane to the text, driving the action and adding psychological depth.  The opening sequence, with its emphasis on a search that remains quite unspecified, is too protracted to create an impact and the ending does not seem to produce the restorative effect that is called-for \u2014 this is not surprising because it is not easy to tamper with the exposition and the resolution of a Shakespearean tragedy and get away with it. But, quite creditably, the middle that comprises the bulk of the play moves smoothly owing to spirited performances by Acharya and Dey. Undoubtedly one of the best actors in the Bengali theatre of our times, Acharya is exceptionally successful in projecting the nuances of the multiple layers of her role. Dey is most effective when he eschews a stilted and an affected manner of dialogue delivery in favour of a more unadorned pattern of speech. ",

        "Article Content": "With an elegantly supple body and remarkable control over the idiom and the nuances of Odissi, Krishnendu Saha presented an enthra\u00adl\u00adling work titled   at the Odissi Vision & Movement Centre\u2019s performance space recently. The piece has the familiar tale of Rama and the golden deer, Mareech, at its core and is cleverly layered with metaphors about and meanings of longing, fulfilment and illusion. The material is complex and Sharmila Biswas\u2019s choreography ensured that the story, profound as it is, pulsated with the dancer\u2019s energetic retelling of it. Whether it was in the expansion and the contraction of the deer\u2019s cavorting body as it ran in quicksilver speed through the forest chased by Rama, or in the fluid images of relentless pursuit as the object of desire inexorably moved further and further away, Saha was mesmerising. His movements were hypnotic and his facial expressions exquisitely evocative. In the dimly-lit liminal space between shadows and illusions created in the studio, it was a close and thrilling encounter with the dancer\u2019s exploration of human beings\u2019 eternal quest for the unattainable. The choreography is based on the song, \u201c \u201d, hauntingly rendered by Shyamamani Pattanaik, which draws from the well-\u00adknown medieval literary work of Odi\u00adsha titled  . Saha consummately embodied the curiosity to scrutinise and the yearning to possess the object of desire, however intriguing or horrifying it may be. The overwhelming confusion and frustration to which such an expedition must inevitably lead added more complexity to the chase. Saha inhabited the centre stage easily and told the tale beguilingly. The minimal intimacy of the space offered an advantage: the dancer\u2019s facial expressions can be observed from close quarters. And Saha ensures that it is a treat. The other piece performed by him that evening,  , choreographed by Sharmila Biswas, was also refreshing in its stark beauty and was a Darwinian inquiry into the Matsya-to-Kalki gradation of the  of Vishnu from small and simple creatures of the earth to the most complex and fearsome of them all. At the intersection of Saha\u2019s fluid movements and Biswas\u2019s superb choreography, the piece throbbed with compelling grace and vigour. In Nandanik Movement Arts\u2019  , part of the Horizon series presented by ICCR, Poushali Chatterjee\u2019s exploration of the rhythms of rain allowed her to examine the  cycles of Manipuri dance through Jagoi Raaslila, Nata Sankirtana, Thang Ta, and other ritualistic social and harvest dances.  With pleasing references to stories about the monsoon and its impact on Earth, it was represented through a surge of ecstatic emotions that the rains bring in agricultural terrains. But the gleeful celebration eventually made way for the destruction caused by the collapse of embankments and consequent inundation. The evening also featured traditional pieces such as  ,   and   from the repertoire.  \n       Jalsa Chandra\u2019s   at Gyan Manch was presented at Layavinyas\u2019s dance and music festival,  . The sacred was intertwined with the dramatic in this ambitious work that purported to look at theism through the lens of the Bhakti saints. Starting with mystical stories about creation, the piece moves through Kabir\u2019s  , Baul philosophy as represented by Lalon, Tulsidas\u2019s   and an  in the form of a  that playfully criticises and laughs at one\u2019s deity. In its contemporary classical format, the choreography meandered through many phases and turns.  ",
