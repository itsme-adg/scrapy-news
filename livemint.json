        "Article Content": "Shares of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) rose almost 3 per cent in morning trade on BSE on Friday, September 13, as the company disclosed in an exchange filing that the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) raised its stake in the company. opened at 936 against its previous close of 931.40 and rose 2.7 per cent to the level of 956.80. It, however, pared gains and traded 0.90 per cent up at 939.65 apiece around 12:15 pm. Meanwhile, climbed over a per cent during the session and traded 0.65 per cent up at 1,038.15 on the BSE at that time. In an exchange filing on Friday, September 13, IRCTC informed that LIC had increased its stake in the company by 2.02 per cent from December 16, 2022, to September 11, 2024. This came a day after LIC announced via an exchange filing that it had raised its stake in IRCTC. LIC, in its exchange filing on Thursday, September 12, said, \"This is to inform that the Life Insurance Corporation of India has increased its shareholding in equity shares of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation from 5,82,22,948 to 7,43,79,924, i.e., 7.278 per cent to 9.298 per cent of the paid-up capital of the said company.\" \"Holding increased from 7.278 per cent to 9.298 per cent, a net increase of 2.020 per cent in holding during the period from December 16, 2022, to September 11, 2024, at an average cost of 657.614,\" LIC said. According to the shareholding pattern data of IRCTC, LIC held 7,18,15,695 shares, equivalent to an 8.98 per cent stake in IRCTC as of June 30, 2024. LIC's stake raise in the company is a positive development and indicates its long-term growth potential. Experts appear positive about the IRCTC stock for the long term. Avinash Gorakshkar, the head of research at Profitmart Securities, believes one can consider going long on the stock with an investment horizon of over two years. \"From a fundamental perspective, it is a positive development for IRCTC. This shows that LIC is positive on the stock for the longer term. LIC usually takes a position in a company if it is positive on it for the next two to three years. They do not take a short-term call,\" said Gorakshkar. \"Earnings visibility is strong, and growth prospects are good. IRCTC is a platform-based company that mainly earns money from ticketing, which is like a monopoly. Railways is making a conscious effort to improve efficiency. I think this business will never stop, and it is part and parcel of the Indian economy. IRCTC qualifies as a good long-term investment,\" Gorakshkar said. At the current market price, IRCTC share price has gained 37 per cent this year so far. It hit a 52-week low of 636.10 on October 26 last year and a 52-week high of 1,148.30 on May 22 this year, followed by sharp profit booking. On a monthly scale, the stock remained in the red from May to August this year. However, in September so far, it has gained about a per cent. Jigar S. Patel, Senior Manager of Equity Research at Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers, observed that IRCTC stock price has recently been consolidating around its 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA), often seen as a critical support level. This consolidation suggests that the stock is forming a solid base, indicating a potential shift in trend. \"During the current trading session, the stock attempted to break out of its consolidation range but could not sustain itself above the breakout level, signalling some resistance. From a technical indicator perspective, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has bounced back from the 40 level, coinciding with a bearish trendline break,\" said Patel. \"This reversal in the RSI suggests that bullish momentum may be building in the coming sessions. However, to confirm this upward move, it is recommended to enter the stock only after a decisive close above 953, targeting 1,050, with a stop-loss set at 895 on a daily closing basis to manage risk,\" Patel said.

        "Article Content": "After inching close to the record high of $2,531 per ounce, witnessed sharp selling last week and ended below the psychological $2,500 per ounce mark. COMEX gold price finished at $2,526 per troy ounce, whereas spot gold price ended at $2,497 per ounce. On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold rates for the October 2024 futures contract ended at 71,460 per 10 gm mark on Friday. According to commodity market experts, the mixed set of released last week has cast doubt on the hopes, dragging the gold price worldwide. However, they said that a US Fed rate cut would enable the US central bank to keep the US job market balanced and suggested that US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stick with the rate cut decision in the upcoming US Fed meeting. Speaking on the reason for profit-booking in gold at a record high, Sugandha Sachdeva, Founder of SS WealthStreet, said, \"Gold prices retreated from near-record highs in the international market toward the end of the week following the release of key US payroll data. The report showed that non-farm payrolls rose by 142,000 in August, below the expected 160,000, indicating a slowdown in hiring. Additionally, July's jobs data was significantly revised down to 89,000. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.4% MoM, higher than last month's 0.3% rise, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.2% compared to 4.3% in the previous month. The mixed jobs report, a critical measure of labour market health, reduced the likelihood of a large 50 bps rate cut by the Fed, strengthening the dollar and pressuring gold prices.\" Sugandha Sachdeva of SS WealthStreet said that progress in ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas on the geopolitical front weighed on gold, removing some of the risk premium associated with safe-haven demand. On the upside, the 72,300 per 10 gm mark has acted as a critical resistance level for the over the past three weeks, with a breakthrough signalling potential for further gains. \"The mixed set of US job data last week has put doubts among investors over the US Fed rate cut in upcoming US Fed meeting this month. After renewed fear of the US Labour market's slowdown, some markets expect the US Fed to leave the rate cut promise for the next meeting or announce a 25 bps rate cut that the market has already discounted. However, I expect at least a 50 bps rate cut in the fast-approaching US Fed meeting as it would enable the US central bank to keep the US job market balanced,\" said Anuj Gupta, Head of Commodity & Currency at HDFC Securities. Echoing with Anuj Gupta's views on the US Fed rate cut, Standard Chartered analyst Suki Cooper said, \u201cWe think the Fed is likely to cut more steeply, and that's when we think gold prices will build upside risk, and we'll start to see prices trading towards $2,700 as the year unfolds.\u201d According to the CME FedWatch tool, traders currently see a 73% chance of a 25-basis-point (bp) reduction by the US central bank this month and a 27% chance of a 50-bp cut. \"The anticipated start of the easing cycle in the US could act as a tailwind for gold prices, with support likely around 70,900 per 10 gm ($2,470/oz) and 70,200 per 10 gm ($2,420/oz) in the coming days, potentially attracting renewed buying interest,\" said Sugandha Sachdeva.",

        "Article Content": "Budget 2024: The crypto industry expects Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharman to announce several favourable measures in the upcoming Union Budget, including a reduction in transaction taxes, the ability to offset losses, the equal treatment of capital gains from crypto assets and other income sources, and the establishment of a supportive regulatory regime. The Budget 2022-23 introduced regulations mandating that gains from virtual digital assets (VDAs) or crypto assets be taxed at a flat rate of 30 per cent, irrespective of the individual's income tax slab rate. Additionally, a 1 per cent tax deducted at source (TDS) was imposed on every transfer of such assets. However, despite these new regulations, the government did not clarify the legality of these assets, a long-standing demand from the industry. \u201cAs the government prepares for the upcoming Union Budget 2024-25, we urge them to create a conducive regulatory and tax environment that supports the burgeoning digital economy and fosters innovation. The current taxation framework for virtual digital assets, introduced over two years back in the February 2022 Budget, has led to unintended consequences even for the government and the exchequer, primarily via a massive shift in VDA transactions to offshore platforms, impacting tracking and tracing of such transactions,\u201d said Ashish Singhal, co-founder, CoinSwitch. Rajagopal Menon, VP, WazirX, expects a reduction in TDS on the transfer of VDAs, setoff and carryforward of losses, and on-par treatment of income from VDAs in the upcoming Budget 2024-25. One of the main requests is to reduce the TDS rate on the transfer of virtual digital assets under Section 194S to 0.01 per cent. Currently, the higher TDS rate of 1 per cent acts as a deterrent for investors, leading to decreased market liquidity and participation. Lowering the TDS rate would encourage more transactions and foster a healthier trading ecosystem. Additionally, it is recommended to revise the threshold limit for tax deduction under Section 194S, increasing it from 50,000 to 5,00,000. The crypto community is advocating for the ability to offset and carry forward losses, similar to other sectors. Currently, losses from trading VDAs cannot be carried forward to offset future gains from VDAs or any other income sources, discouraging long-term investment and strategic trading. Allowing this flexibility would align the crypto market with other financial markets, promoting a more stable and investor-friendly environment. Another significant demand is to treat income from the transfer of VDAs on par with existing income sources. This involves recognising and taxing crypto income like traditional forms of income, such as from stocks or mutual funds. Such a change would simplify tax compliance for crypto investors and help legitimise cryptocurrency as a mainstream asset class. Additionally, industry representatives noted that amending Section 115BBH to reduce the tax rate from 30 per cent to a rate comparable with other industries would be a welcome improvement. In addition to the financial adjustments mentioned, there is an increasing advocacy for establishing a dedicated regulatory body to oversee crypto transactions. Such an institution would ensure transparency, protect investors, and provide clear compliance guidelines, thereby fostering trust and stability in the market. While the industry welcomed the definition and inclusion of VDAs in the Income Tax Act, certain provisions\u2014such as the high TDS rate and the lack of offset\u2014have led many Indian VDA users to migrate to non-compliant foreign exchanges for trading. This puts them at risk of losing their investments and breaking the law, resulting in reduced tax revenues for the exchequer. The Reserve Bank of India's June 2024 Financial Stability Report (FSR) highlighted the implications of Decentralised Finance (DeFi) for financial stability, aligning with global regulatory efforts to create a secure and stable environment for digital assets. As the Union Budget approaches, incorporating these insights by establishing a robust regulatory framework under the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the RBI can help mitigate stability risks in the DeFi and digital asset space, ensuring India remains competitive in this evolving global market. The crypto community remains hopeful that the Ministry of Finance will consider these proposals, leading to positive outcomes in the Union Budget 2024-25. Implementing changes such as reducing TDS and allowing the setoff and carryforward of losses would encourage broader participation in the crypto market. According to industry experts, a supportive regulatory environment is crucial for stimulating innovation, as it empowers the sector to transform existing businesses through the integration of blockchain technology.",

        "Article Content": "The rift in the British Royal family, especially between , is quite evident. These all happened after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex reportedly revealed dark secrets of royals in tell-all interviews with Meghan Markle, followed by memoir, 'Spare'. If this was not enough to strangle the relationship between the two brothers of the royal family, another issue that offended the future King William was Harry and Markle publicly referring to , reported The while quoting the sources from the Wales, mentioned that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's reference to the Princess of Wales on her cancer recovery and being called as 'Kate' infuriated Prince William. According to , both were unaware of everything going on with Kate Middleton's health. When the Princess of Wales shared that she was undergoing preventative chemotherapy to treat cancer \u2013 found after her planned abdominal surgery, the Sussexes released a touching statement. But again they mentioned the as 'Kate'. Harry and Meghan's message reads, as quoted, \"We wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace.\" Quoting a friend of , the outlet wrote, \"The fact that Harry and Meghan were unable to bring themselves to use her chosen name, even when they were sending her get-well-soon messages after her cancer diagnosis, was noted.\" \"William takes offense at people calling Catherine \u2018Kate,\u2019 because she has asked to be known as Catherine. It\u2019s a fairly simple wish to respect. I\u2019m sure Meghan wouldn\u2019t like it if William started publicly calling her \u2018Meghan Markle\u2019,\" the outlet added. The friend mentioned, though the incident was trival, but for William it was not acceptable. \u201cOf course it\u2019s an utterly trivial thing, but those of us who know William know that it is one of the things that pushes his buttons. Pushing his buttons while he was going through his wife\u2019s cancer seemed an entirely unnecessary and deliberate irritation. I wonder if the private card began, \u2018Dear Kate\u2026\u2019\u201d While a second friend of William and Catherine's noted that the improper name calling isn't the crux of their issues. \u201cNo-one\u2019s saying it\u2019s responsible for all the trouble, but deliberately calling someone by a name they don\u2019t like is just bloody rude,\" the source said. \"If Harry and Meghan were serious about healing their issue, a good first step would be to call her Catherine,\u201d the outlet quoted the other friend as saying.",

        "Article Content": "Conservationists generally disapprove of flooding species-rich habitats. But the law of unintended consequences works in mysterious ways. For it was just such a flood, in 1913, that created Barro Colorado Island in central Panama. Gatun, the lake surrounding the island, was, at the time of its birth, the largest artificial body of water in the world. It formed the middle passage of the Panama Canal. Barro Colorado, meanwhile, has become the most intensively scrutinised scrap of tropical rainforest on Earth. The field station from which this scrutiny is conducted opened in 1924, and in 1946 it was taken over by the Smithsonian Institution, which dubbed the operation the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI). Since then, the island, and some neighbouring areas of forest on the mainland that have fallen under the STRI\u2019s auspices, have turned into biology\u2019s equivalent of a big physics facility like CERN, the home of the Large Hadron Collider. Though the STRI itself employs only 35 scientists, a further 1,200 visit each year, many of whom are regulars. To mark the field station\u2019s centenary, a horde of old hands and enthusiastic youngsters gathered on June 18th in Gamboa, the island\u2019s nearest town, for three days of festivities to celebrate the past and plot the future. They discussed everything from how new species arise and the effect of lightning on insect ecology, to tropical forests\u2019 role in curbing climate change. Biology\u2019s hundred-year scrutiny of Barro Colorado means its wildlife has been recorded in exquisite detail. The current roll lists 110 species of mammal (70% of which are bats), 384 birds, 33 frogs and toads, two salamanders, 23 lizards, 41 snakes, more than 400 ants, some 600 butterflies, 10,000 beetles and even 100 cockroaches. There are also 1,400 species of plants. Given this abundance, it is hardly surprising that the place has been the source of several fundamental ecological findings, and many new techniques of observation. Early on, for example, it provided the first good test of the idea that the number of species a patch of habitat can support depends on its area. The so-called species-area relationship predicted that Barro Colorado\u2019s sudden isolation would cause local extinctions. Which it did. Ornithologists saw bird species dwindle in number by more than a quarter, while remaining unchanged in similar habitats on the mainland. Among other things, that result demonstrates the value of scale, if nature reserves are to be effective. Barro Colorado also hosted the first serious study of wild primates (howler monkeys, by Clarence Ray Carpenter in the 1930s), the first big field investigation of echolocation in bats (by Donald Griffin in the 1950s), and the first attempt to attach numbers to the obvious truth that the tropics support more species of creepy-crawly than temperate climes do. This was launched in 1971, by Terry Erwin, an entomologist who \u201cfogged\u201d tree canopies on the island with insecticide, collected what fell out, and recorded the arthropods he found in each tree type. Combining this information with estimates of the number of tree species around the world, he concluded that Earth supported about 30m sorts of insects and other terrestrial arthropods. The current calculation is about a quarter of this, so it was not a bad estimate. The island\u2019s plants have not been neglected. Between 1981 and 1983 a block of 50 of its 1,560 hectares was surveyed in detail by Robin Foster and Stephen Hubbell, to record the location and species of every tree and shrub with a stem-diameter of more than 1cm (initially, these numbered 242,000). The Forest Dynamics Plot, as it is known, has since been resurveyed every five years, permitting the life cycles of many woody plants to be understood in far better detail than was previously possible. It has also inspired the establishment of 77 similar plots in forests around the world, both tropical and temperate, containing 7m specimens of 13,000 species. On top of all this, the STRI has itself provided a salutary example of the social evolution of American science over the past century. The field station\u2019s founders were men carved in the image of Theodore Roosevelt, the American president whose methods for getting the Panama Canal built included involving his country in a minor war. (The old-boy culture endured, as sexual-misconduct allegations revealed in 2021 made plain.) Today, though, the institute has become\u2014fittingly\u2014more representative of human diversity. It is one thing to measure and describe the luxuriant biodiversity of the tropics, though, and quite another to explain it. Speciation\u2019s details can be hard to demonstrate. But in the case of trees of the genus Inga, which boasts 300 species, Phyllis Coley of the University of Utah, one of the station\u2019s old hands (she began her work there in 1995), thinks she has done so. The driving force behind Inga\u2019s diversity, according to Dr Coley and her team, is herbivory\u2014specifically by the moth and butterfly caterpillars that eat its members\u2019 leaves. Over the years, they have studied 174 of these lepidopteran persecutors. They have shown that most are picky eaters, choosing their meals based on which toxic chemicals (there are about 200 varieties) particular trees pack into their leaves. Such specialisation in turn encourages diversification, as new species with new, temporarily insect-proof toxin profiles emerge. Predation by insects is not, however, the only thing that encourages arboreal speciation. Habitat differences can help. Camila Pizano, of Lake Forest College in Illinois, studies the island\u2019s population of Trema micrantha. This comes in two types, distinguishable by the sizes of their seeds, which prefer subtly different habitats. As she explained, both require the forest\u2019s otherwise-uninterrupted canopy to have been opened to the sky by some accident to provide light for their growth. One variety, though, does best if the opening was caused by a landslip, which clears the soil of nitrogen-rich leaf litter and exposes the phosphorus-rich subsurface. The other thrives in the aftermath of a tree fall, when the soil remains nitrogen-rich and phosphorus-poor. Whatever the details, T. micrantha looks like a species dividing in two. How insects speciate is also under investigation at the STRI. Owen McMillan and his group study a genus of toxic butterflies called Heliconius, which warn predators off by evolving distinctive colour patterns mimicked by other, less toxic, species. As part of their work this group\u2019s researchers have used CRISPR genetic editing to create a novel butterfly wing-colour pattern that looks, superficially, at least, like a new species. Whether the new morph, with its ivory-coloured wings, would prosper in the wild is unlikely ever to be tested, for releasing gene-edited organisms is frowned on.But the ability to create new heliconid designs is intriguing. There was more. Much more. Rachel Page, heir to Griffin as head of the institute\u2019s bat research, reviewed classic studies of how the island\u2019s 74 bat species are defined not only by what they eat (fruit, frogs, fish, insects and, for vampires, blood) but also by when and where, thus minimising competition and increasing the effective number of ecological niches. Kane Lawhorn entertained the troops with an explanation of how the frequency of lightning strikes regulates beetle populations (by providing food in the form of dead and injured trees), while Andrew Seiler talked of a different sort of \u201cweather\u201d: the constant rain of arthropods pitter-pattering from the canopy to the forest floor. Roland Kays described his adventures tracking kinkajous (arboreal relatives of raccoons) with GPS-enabled radio tags and told of one particularly large and dominant male being posthumously crapped on in apparent triumph by rivals. His collaborator, Meg Crofoot, explained that kinkajous, which have smaller brains than the local monkeys, are just as successful at foraging for food, suggesting better foraging is not the reason big brains have evolved. Such findings are striking. But Barro Colorado\u2019s most important contribution to ecology may be in serving as inspiration to try similar things elsewhere. Those 77 simulacra of the Forest Dynamics Plot, for example, constitute, together with the Panamanian original, a network called the Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO), which is an attempt to compare and contrast forest ecology across the planet. Stuart Davies, ForestGEO\u2019s director, told the meeting that ForestGEO itself is being recruited, along with similar networks covering tropical, temperate and boreal forests, into a megaproject called GEO-trees. The organisers of this hope to use local estimates of biomass to calibrate satellite measurements of the same areas. That would make extrapolations from space-based measurements more reliable. This is important. Tropical rainforests are huge stores of carbon that might otherwise add to atmospheric carbon dioxide. Understanding whether they are, in any given place, increasing their carbon stocks or releasing them into the air, is crucial to monitoring global warming. More accurate measurements would also enable more regular check-ups to police untoward changes. For, much as urgent change is needed to combat global warming, when it comes to forests, the urgent need is for nothing to change at all.",

The company's revenue for the quarter increased by 11.66% year-over-year, reaching new heights. The profit saw an even more impressive rise of 88.11% YoY, highlighting the company's strong operational efficiency. In comparison to the previous quarter, however, the revenue witnessed a slight decline of 1.84%. Despite this, the profit surged by 114.95% quarter-over-quarter, indicating effective cost management and enhanced profitability. The company reported a decline in Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses by 1.49% quarter-over-quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, these expenses increased by 17.35%, reflecting some inflationary pressures and increased spending. Operating income for Q1 was up by 48.63% compared to the last quarter but showed a decrease of 13.48% on a year-over-year basis. This mixed performance in operating income suggests fluctuations in operational efficiencies over different periods. Earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter stood at 2.71, marking an increase of 16.31% YoY. This rise in EPS underscores the company's ability to generate higher earnings for its shareholders. Modi Rubber has delivered a return of 0.69% in the last week, 11.22% over the past six months, and a year-to-date (YTD) return of 14.29%.

The world's 14th richest person with a net worth of more than $102 billion has listed dishwasher, busboy, and waiter as part of his work experience from 1978 to 1983 on his LinkedIn profile. As a teenager, Huang used to work as a dishwasher and cleaned toilets at the restaurant chain Denny's in Oregon. Later, he took other odd jobs such as a busboy and a waiter. \u201cRemember, I used to be a dishwasher. I mean that. I used to clean toilets. I\u2019ve cleaned a lot of toilets. I\u2019ve cleaned more toilets than all of you (audience) combined. And some of them I just can\u2019t unsee,\u201d said while discussing his job at Denny's. \u201cYou can\u2019t show me a task that\u2019s beneath me. I\u2019m not doing it only because whether it\u2019s beneath me or not. If you send me something and you want my input on it, and I can be of service to you, and in my review of it, share with you how I reasoned through it, I\u2019ve made a contribution to you. I\u2019ve made it possible for you to see how I reasoned through something,\u201d he said. The 61-year-old billionaire holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering from Oregon State University and a master\u2019s degree in engineering from Stanford University. was born in Taiwan. His family moved to Thailand when he was five years old and at the age of nine he was sent to the US to live with an uncle. According to a report, Jensen continued to work as a microprocessor designer at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and as director of CoreWare at LSI Logic after his graduation. However, his LinkedIn profile shows a gap of 10 years from 1983 to 1993. In 1993, he founded Nvidia, one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. The screenshot of Jensen Huang\u2019s LinkedIn profile shared on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) has garnered lakhs of views since first shared on August 28. Several X users have praised and applauded Huang\u2019s journey from a dishwasher to a billionaire CEO.",

FCNR deposits can continue until maturity without the need to convert them to RFC deposits. The tax exemption on interest earned from FCNR deposits also applies to RFC deposits. This exemption is available while the individual is either a non-resident or a resident, but not ordinarily resident (RNOR). Consequently, the interest from RFC deposits will remain tax-free only until the financial year in which the returning Indian is considered an RNOR. After that financial year, the interest income will become taxable. Many NRIs encounter a common issue related to SFT (statement of financial transactions) reporting by financial institutions to the tax authorities, particularly for high-value transactions. When the business intelligence platform of the income tax department believes that information received from various sources is not consistent with the taxpayer\u2019s income profile, it flags off the information to the assessee for verification before issuing any notice. In such cases, NRIs can login to the compliance portal and submit his/her feedback, indicating that the information relates to a different PAN (viz. NRI who is the first holder) and also highlight the relationship to the other person and the corresponding year to which the information relates. After submission of the feedback, the responses would be examined and taken into consideration. To minimise the risk of receiving summons, scrutiny or reassessment notices for being listed as a joint holder, NRIs should file their ITR regularly. Despite the above approaches, if you prefer to avoid risks, then you may remove your spouse\u2019s name as joint holder and, instead, make your spouse as a nominee for your NRE deposit.",

        "Article Content": "\u2014Name withheld on request For a startup, often the right set of insurances become critical to attract the right quality of talent. Thankfully, you could buy the best of group insurances available to larger companies. Some of the key insurances that you should consider include group health insurance, group personal accident and group term life. The group programmes can be customized to specific requirements of the company. Elements like sum assured, policy sub-limits and exclusions, can be modified depending on the budget of the company. You should consult a employee benefit-focused insurance broker to help you design these plans. For health insurance policies, specific \u201cmodern treatments\u201d have been listed under the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irdai)'s guidelines. This list comprises advanced methods of intervention that were often excluded by insurers. Now, IRDAI has made it mandatory for all health insurance policies to cover a list of modern treatments, including balloon sinuplasty, deep brain stimulation and robotic surgeries. So, irrespective of the insurer, these treatments are covered under health insurance. However, the regulator has allowed insurers to put sub-limits for such treatments. As a result, insurers impose an absolute cap or limit coverage to a proportion of the sum assured. Traditionally, insurers used to insist on hard copies of all claim documents, including the discharge summary, hospital bills and receipts, which were required to be submitted in original. However, over the last few years, some insurers have started to settle claims based on soft copies. The documents can be emailed to the insurer for processing. Furthermore, a handful of insurance intermediaries have the provision of mobile apps, through which health claims can be submitted. In such cases, the claim submission process becomes even more straightforward. All policy details are pre-filled in the app. Policyholders must click pictures of the documents and upload it on the app. Submission of claims through app or portal has reduced the turnaround time of claim settlements substantially. Since these apps are connected directly with insurer\u2019s claim processing system via APIs, data get transferred in digitized format. This reduces the workload of insurers and ensures a lower turnaround time. You should note that even if one insurer settles the claim on soft copy, this does not mean that the originals can be submitted to another insurer to make the same claim twice. Since insurance is issued under the principle of indemnity, a policyholder can claim only up to the actual expenditure incurred.",

Gifts received by a from its members are treated as gifts from relatives and thus are exempt in the hands of the HUF under Section 56(2)(x). Since your father is not a member of your HUF, the gift he gave will become taxable in your HUF\u2019s hands if the aggregate of gifts received by the HUF from all the sources during the year exceeds fifty thousand rupees. So when he makes a gift of Rs. 4 lakhs to your HUF and the HUF invests and claims deduction for Rs. 1.50 lakhs under Section 80 C there will not be any tax liability on the HUF as Rs. 2.50 is the basic exemption limit for HUF under the old tax regime. Yes, your HUF will have to file its ITR as the total taxable before the deduction under Section 80C would be more than the threshold of basic exemption. Please ensure that you file your ITR by the due date to avail yourself of the deduction under Section 80C. If you fail to file the ITR by the due date, the new tax regime will be the only option available to you. Please note that you must prove your father's source of funds if your HUF case is selected for detailed scrutiny. This is the entirely legal and the perfect way to create capital for your HUF.",

You should buy a pure-term plan for your life cover and invest in a diversified scheme of any good mutual fund house. Though ULIP is sold as an investment product and not an insurance product, please understand that the ULIP plans have various continuing charges, reducing your overall investment return. Moreover, have a liquidity problem, as you cannot receive money from your ULIP investments before they expire in five years, even if you surrender them before five years. The traditional plans of companies do not offer good returns, and historically, the returns have been equal to those offered on savings bank accounts. Such returns are not even able to beat inflation. In ULIP and traditional plans, you neither get adequate life cover nor adequate return. You must buy life insurance coverage equal to 15 to 18 times your annual income through a term plan, preferably online if you can. The balance can be invested in the ratio of 90% in the Diversified Equity MF Fund or the balance of 10% in PPF and Sovereign Gold Bonds.

If he is deemed to have been let out of a property, the taxpayer has to offer notional rent for taxation even though he has not received any rent on such property.

An individual and a can claim the exemption in respect of long-term capital gains arising from the transfer/sale of any capital asset other than a residential house under section 54F if a residential house is purchased within two years from the date of sale of the long term capital assets provided the taxpayer does not own more than one house on the date of sale of the long term capital asset. You have satisfied both the conditions, and thus, prime facie can claim an exemption under Section 54F. Likewise, one can claim an exemption under Section 54 regarding long-term capital gains on the sale of a residential house, provided the capital gains are invested for buying another residential house within the prescribed period. There is no express ban on one claiming exemption under Sections 54 and 54F in the same financial year. Still, section 54F provides that exemption under Section 54 F is not available if the taxpayer buys a residential house other than the one in respect of which he is claiming exemption under section 54F, within a period of one year from the date of sale of the asset in respect of which the exemption under section 54 F is sought to be claimed. Since you are buying flat B within one year from the date of sale of the shares, you are not eligible to claim an exemption under section 54 F regarding investments made in flat A. If the sequence of purchasing the house had been different, and you had bought the residential flat B to claim the exemption under section 54 before selling the shares, you would have been able to claim an exemption under both sections even if both the transactions took place in the same financial year. Since the law allows you to claim the exemption in respect of long-term capital gains even if you have purchased a residential house within one year before the date of sale of long-term assets, you can claim an exemption under Section 54 against the purchase of flat A as the same has been bought within one year before the sale of the residential house and claim exemption under Section 54 F against flat B which is also being purchased within the prescribed period. This way, you could circumvent the restriction of buying an additional residential house within one year from the date of the sale of shares.

Each coparcener acquires the assets as his property on the total partition of a HUF. Since three generations of sons and daughters constitute coparceners of the HUF of the male ancestor, the sons and daughters are entitled to get a share in the assets allotted to the coparcener representing the family. In such case, the properties received by the male coparcener on the partition will not be treated as belonging to HUF of that son but of all the coparceners of his family in their individual capacity.

According to a report by , Justice Anand Venkatesh emphasized the work done by AYUSH doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic, and added that traditional medicines were also recommended to the infected patient under AYUSH which provided relief to several patients. Therefore the Madras HC asserted that it would be irrelevant to deprive policyholders of getting reimbursements for the amount spent on AYUSH treatments under the medical insurance. The court also said that an individual decides to either opt for an AYUSH treatment or an Allopathic treatment, therefore, the expenses incurred in either of the treatments had to be placed on equal scales. The judge said giving preference to allopathy would be discriminatory and directed IRDAI to draft a policy keeping AYUSH treatments in mind. The Madras HC also asked IRDAI to encourage traditional treatments like AYUSH. It said patients who undergo such treatments should be entitled to receive the insurance amount for the expenses incurred by him. The Madras HC was hearing two pleas filed by an advocate and a clerk claiming full reimbursements of the amount by their respective insurance companies. The petitioners had taken the policies for a sum of 5 lakh and 4 lakh respectively after getting Covid treatment at Siddha Hospital and had sought reimbursements for their expenses. The insurance company said that the policies were by IRDAI's regulations under which a cap was placed on the maximum amount of reimbursements that could be provided for availing treatment at AYUSH hospitals. The company said that for the policies of the sum of 5 lakh, the maximum cap fixed was 5 lakh and for 4 lakh policies, the amount was fixed at 10,000 which was reimbursed to the petitioners.

AYUSH refers to the treatment given under alternative therapies of Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy. The latest move stems from the growing prevalence of these treatments, because of which the regulator felt the need to consider these treatments at par with other treatments for the purpose of . The IRDAI circular says, \u201cthe insurance companies will have a board approved policy for providing AYUSH coverage which will include their approach towards placing AYUSH treatments at par with other treatments for the purpose of health insurance so as to provide an option for the policyholders to choose treatment of their choice.\u201d \u201cThe policy will also contain the quality parameters as well as procedure for enrolling AYUSH hospitals/ day care centres as network providers for the purpose of providing cashless facilities,\u201d the circular adds.

        "Article Content": "With the rising number of cancer cases, a person is just one illness away from blowing off all their savings and moving into debt. Hence, it is important to be financially prepared for such fatal diseases with health coverage. Protection from cancer treatment costs demands an additional health insurance cover above standard health insurance. By 2050, over 35 million new cancer cases are expected to be reported across the world. According to the World Health Organisation\u2019s latest report, the number of new cancer cases will increase by a massive 77 per cent in 2050 from the estimated 20 million cases in 2022. In India, 14.3 lakh new cancer cases and 9.16 lakh deaths were reported in 2022. On World Cancer Day, know about the options that can help in covering cancer treatment expenses. A large number of standard health insurance cover expenses that are related to cancer treatment like hospitalisation expenses. People can also opt for riders with their standard health insurance cover for cancer treatment. However, standard health insurance might not cover all the expenses of treatment. There is also another option of opting for cancer-specific health insurance which covers the expenses after a person is diagnosed with cancer. \u201cA cancer-specific insurance is focused on expenses directly associated with cancer, covering diagnosis, treatment, hospitalisation, surgery, and medication costs. It provides coverage at both early and advanced stages of cancer,\u201d explains Business Head of Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com, Siddharth Singhal. One of the ways to guard against the financial burden of cancer treatment is to opt for a critical illness insurance plan. Such plans offer fixed benefits that provide coverage for a specific list of illnesses, including cancer, heart attack, kidney failure, liver disorders, etc. \u201cA critical illness cover acts as a top\u2013up to your basic health insurance, providing a lump sum payment upon the diagnosis of critical illnesses like cancer, heart attack, organ failure, paralysis, etc. In contrast to typical health insurance plans, which reimburse based on hospital bills, critical illness coverage guarantees a fixed sum, regardless of treatment costs,\u201d noted Singhal. A critical insurance plan provides cover for nearly 30 life-threatening illnesses, including cancer. Underlining the benefit of a critical insurance plan, Singhal adds that it \u201coffers a more versatile solution for individuals seeking comprehensive protection against various serious health conditions\u201d. However, a cancer plan is relevant for a person with a family history, as it covers the expenses after a person is diagnosed. \u201cA cancer plan is more relevant if you have a family history. If not, it is better to first buy a critical illness plan. Regular health plans also cover cancer, so the principal advantage with an indemnity cancer plan is that OPD expenses are covered and a sum assured is set aside for cancer,\u201d Co-Founder SecureNow, Abhishek Bondia earlier told Mint. Sum Insured: It is important to be mindful of the sum insured in illness insurance coverage. In most of the life-threatening illnesses, the associated treatment cost can soar to 30-40 lakhs. Opting for a policy with a coverage range of 50 lakh to 1 crore becomes vital to ensure adequate financial protection, according to Siddharth Singhal. Diseases covered: The number of critical illnesses covered varies in different plans. \u201cHence, policyholders should verify that their policy extends coverage to at least 30 critical illnesses and has a survival period requirement of 7-15 days to avail of the benefits,\u201d said Singhal. In addition to this, it is equally important to compare and analyse various cancer coverage plans online for an informed decision. Moreover, it is a must to have a better understanding of the exclusions in the policy.",

Tailored insurance plans can offer coverage for breast cancer screening, diagnostic tests, treatments, and post-treatment care to ensure early detection and effective management of the disease. Insurance policies include coverage for gender-specific illnesses such as cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometriosis, ensuring timely diagnosis and treatment. Insurance policies can include coverage for regular health check-ups, preventive screenings, and wellness programs tailored to women's health needs. Comprehensive coverage for critical illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes can ensure access to advanced medical treatments and ongoing care for women facing serious health challenges. The latest Periodic Labour Force Survey for 2021-22 highlights that the Female labour force participation (FLFPR) rate in India for the working age group (15 years & above) has increased considerably to 32.8%, still well below the global average of 47 percent for several years. Insurance schemes can support by providing packaged coverage for businesses, business interruption coverage plans, and fostering entrepreneurship and economic empowerment. Income protection plans specifically designed for women can provide financial support in case of career breaks due to childbirth, caregiving responsibilities, or health issues. Insurance plans may offer childcare benefits to help working mothers cover the costs of childcare services, enabling them to balance work and family responsibilities effectively. By incorporating these various coverage into insurance policies, insurers would effectively address the specific needs and priorities of women, promoting gender equality, financial inclusion, and overall well-being.",

This is also true if any one of the immediate family members falls sick on the trip or dies. Sandeep Bajaj, advocate at the of India, added, \u201cThe definition as to what falls under health emergency varies with the policies, but it generally covers sudden, unforeseen illnesses or injuries requiring immediate medical attention that necessitates changing travel plans.\u201d Kapoor said that the definition of immediate family varies with different insurers, \u201cbut majorly, siblings, spouse, father, mother, all those are considered family across all insurance.\u201d Experts suggested that in the case of a medical emergency, a traveller is required to submit all the proofs to get a refund. \u201cIn such an event, the passenger must preserve and collate all the relevant documents necessary to prove the existence of a medical emergency,\u201d said Vipul Jai, partner at PSL Advocates & Solicitors.

        "Article Content": "New Delhi: As India\u2019s youngest airline Akasa Air prepares to launch international flights next week, the low-cost carrier has plans to register record expansion in international segment and expects to connect cities across Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia in the next 2-3 years, a top company executive said. \u201cWe are interested in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia. A couple of years from now, it is more than likely that we will be flying to these destinations. For now, we certainly hope to operate to multiple international destinations by the end of this summer season,\u201d founder and chief executive officer Vinay Dube said at a roundtable discussion. Akasa Air, which commenced flight operations in India in August 2022, is slated to operate its maiden international flight on 28 March from Mumbai to Doha. The airline had operated its first domestic flight from Mumbai to Ahmedabad. While there are challenges in availability of flying rights for cities such as Dubai and Sharjah, there is also a big pool of options for the airline such as Abu Dhabi, Jeddah, Riyadh, Dammam, and Bahrain to add international destinations going forward, Dube said. \"It is just the beginning. Our planes have the capability to fly non-stop to east coast of Africa from the North, to Hong Kong from Bengaluru, Kolkata etc. Based on the international demand that we foresee coming out of India, we will be able to get to those levels in 2-3 years in international segment, which (other) airlines took over 15 years to get in India,\u201d Dube added. The airline, which has a 4.5% market share in domestic segment, is also bullish on the growth story of the Indian air travel market in both domestic and international segments. \"March used to be a seasonally-weak quarter, but the kind of demand we are seeing play out in India and for markets to and from India is fantastic. We are going to see this amazing demand for the next 10 years. I see demand outpacing capacity for the next 10 years,\u201d Dube said. The airline operates a fleet of 24 Boeing B737 MAX aircraft in India. In January, Akasa had placed a $20-billion order for an additional 150 narrow-body Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. The latest order takes the airline\u2019s cumulative order book to 226 planes with the anticipated delivery of the rest of the order over the next eight years through 2032. In January, the airline, along with Air India Express and SpiceJet, was asked by civil aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation to carry out a one-time inspection of the emergency exits on all Boeing 737-8 MAX aircraft after an incident with US carrier Alaska airlines on a Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft in which a door plug or a structure installed to replace an optional emergency exit door blew out. The DGCA had then informed that the checks were \u201csatisfactorily performed.\u201d \u201cNobody in aviation can put too much of an effort on safety. We are happy with increased and renewed focus of Boeing, Federal Aviation Administration, our regulator (DGCA), and we think this is a good thing. What we are flying today is safe. The issues are not just with another variant, it is with a modification of another variant. We are flying a standard aircraft,\u201d Dube said. The airline is also confident of smooth implementation of new flight duty time limitations norms which increase weekly rest periods for flight crew or pilots to 48 hours per week from the previous 36 hours. Airlines such as Air India and IndiGo had written to DGCA for a one-year postponement of the June deadline citing that these norms could result in shortage of pilots. \u201cAt Akasa, we plan for the future. We have 700 pilots and a fleet of 24 aircraft. When the switchover happens, you are not going to see any change in reliability from Akasa,\u201d he said. He added that the airline has plans to launch a cadet programme for pilots in the near future. \u201cIndia continues to have a massive pipeline of unemployed commercial pilot licence holders, my message to them is with increased demand and planes coming, there is a spot for you. But, there will be a need (of cadet programme) in the coming months,\u201d he added.",

Despite the growing popularity of OPD coverage in health insurance, only a limited number of health insurers provide this feature in their basic plan. However, customers can still opt for OPD coverage with the help of an additional rider. According to PB data, 47% of customers opting for this feature fall within the 31-45% age bracket, whereas 34% of the customers are in the 18-30 segment. Most of these insurance plans are popular in Tier 1 cities, as nearly 45% of people opt for health insurance policies with OPD benefits from Tier 1 cities. Second is the tier-3 category. Whereas, people living in these cities make up 35% of customers opting for health insurance with OPD benefits. Certain cities exhibit a higher concentration of customers opting for plans with OPD benefits, with Vellore (12.3%), Tiruvallur (10.9%), and Mathura (10.2%) leading the trend.",

        "Article Content": "Comprehensive health insurance provides a much-needed shield from critical illnesses and unprecedented health emergencies. In contrast to a higher sum insured amount, which provides a cushion to expensive treatment, a health plan with an unlimited sum insured amount eliminates the concern of exhausting the claim limit during treatment. Currently, there are fewer options for health insurance plans with unlimited sum insured features. However, they can act as saviour in terms of critical illnesses and other ailments requiring advanced treatment. Here\u2019s all you need to know about unlimited sum insured plans. The sum insured by a health insurance plan is the maximum amount a person can avail for healthcare treatment. As the name suggests, an unlimited sum insured plan provides unlimited coverage to customers for healthcare treatment. Generally, health insurance plans come with a sum insured amount of 5 lakh, 25 lakh, 1 crore, and more. However, there is no capping on the amount under unlimited sum insured plans. This feature empowers customers to avail of healthcare treatment without worrying about cost. An unlimited sum insured plan is helpful for people with pre-existing diseases or those at risk of age-related disease, according to Siddharth Singhal - Head of Health Insurance, Policybazaar.com. \u201cPeople are often confused when choosing sum insured because you never know when a medical emergency might hit you. Covid, for instance, nobody could\u2019ve imagined it, but it wreaked havoc on people\u2019s lifetime savings. In such cases, it\u2019s best to go with an unlimited sum insured,\u201d said Singhal. By opting for this plan, a person can claim their health insurance unlimited times in a year with no upper limit for the claim amount. However, the situation varies according to the plan. Recently, ICICI Lombard launched a health insurance product, \u2018Elevate\u2019, which provides unlimited sum insured to policyholders. People can opt for this feature as an add-on service or as a critical feature of their policy. Bajaj Allianze\u2019s Health Infinity Plan provides unlimited coverage. Customers can also avail themselves of wellness discounts, family discounts, and other benefits. The Unlimited Acko Platinum Plan also comes with an unlimited sum insured feature, allowing people to claim unlimited coverage for their health care treatment. Other key features of the plan include a zero-waiting period for pre-existing disease (PED) and 100% hospitalisation bill payment. Health insurance plans with an unlimited sum insured come with higher premiums than plans with a fixed sum insured amount. \u201cThe unlimited health insurance plan costs between 15,000 and 20,000. If a person chooses a plan with a 10 lakh sum insured and above and adds a rider for unlimited coverage, it\u2019ll cost them about 7,000\u2014 8,000 + 10% for the rider,\u201d explained Singhal.",

        "Article Content": "Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Survey 2023-2024 in the Lok Sabha, highlighting key aspects of India's economic landscape. Concurrently, the Annual Report of IRDAI for FY23-24 underscored substantial challenges in the insurance sector. Notably, over two lakh complaints were lodged via the centralised grievance portal, with a significant portion targeting life insurers for unfair business practices, excluding the Life Insurance Corporation of India. \"Product misselling is too rampant to be dismissed as an aberration of a few overenthusiastic sales personnel. The same can be said of the insurance industry as well. Prompt and reasonable settlement of insurance claims and a lower rejection rate are necessary to increase insurance penetration. Acknowledging misselling and misrepresentation and compensating for consequential losses is a good business practice enjoined upon stockbroking, fund management, banking and insurance firms,\" the document noted. The Union government tabled the . The Economic Survey document, prepared by the Economic Division of the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance and formulated under the supervision of the chief economic adviser, gives insights into the state of the economy and various indicators of 2023-24 (April-March) and some outlook for the current year. With this upcoming budget presentation, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will surpass the record set by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959 and 1964 as finance minister. Sitharaman's upcoming budget speech will be her seventh. \u201cWe commend the IRDAI's initiatives to prioritize the wellbeing of policyholders, from implementing cashless systems to emphasizing Ombudsman schemes, ensuring policyholders' interests are safeguarded. However, with increasing climate change and economic development-related risks, there is a pressing need to protect against unforeseen disruptions. The upcoming Union Budget 2024 presents an opportunity to promote sustainable development goals by prioritizing risk management and protection. We recommend that the government consider the following measures: \u2022Increase the upper limit for tax exemption on health insurance premiums to INR 75,000. \u2022Introduce financial support or tax benefits for extensive insurance on electric vehicles (EVs). \u2022Give tax advantages for cyber insurance, particularly for small and medium businesses, to enhance their ability to withstand cyber risks and data breaches. \u2022Mandate health insurance to all employers for their employees to bring holistic protection to the working class. Implementing these measures will not only create a more resilient and sustainable economic environment but also pave the way for a healthier and greener future, fostering a sense of optimism and progress.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "The Bombay High Court has dismissed a petition filed by Amit Goenka contesting the Securities and Exchange Board of India\u2019s (Sebi) appointment of KPMG as a forensic auditor to probe alleged fund siphoning at Shirpur Gold Refinery. In its 2021 communication, Sebi had appointed KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services as a forensic auditor to review the financial statements of Shirpur Gold Refinery Ltd for the fiscal years 2018-2019 through 2020-2021. KPMG had submitted a report March 2023. The market regulator, an interim order dated 25 April 2023, accused debt-ridden Shirpur Gold of fund diversion. Goenka served as the company\u2019s non-executive chairman in 2021-22. \u201cWe do not find any justifiable reason assigned by the petitioner (Amit Goenka) in the writ petition for the belated challenge being raised to the appointment of KPMG as forensic auditor on 13 September 2021,\" a bench comprising justices Rajesh S Patil and AS Chandurkar said in an order that was uploaded Thursday. The high court said that Goenka was free to pursue the matter before Sebi in accordance with the law. Sebi\u2019s interim order was prompted by a February 2021 complaint, alleging that loans taken by Shirpur Gold Refinery were not used for company operations but were siphoned off to companies under the control of Subhash Chandra, chairman emeritus of Essel Group, and his family. The complaint also alleged that Shirpur had failed to provide public shareholders with information regarding its operations, leading Sebi to investigate the matter. On 25 April 2023, the markets regulator had issued a show-cause notice cum interim order against Amit Goenka, Shirpur Gold Refinery, and five others for alleged fraudulent practices and manipulation of financial statements. In its order, Sebi, through its whole-time member Ashwani Bhatia, directed that the entities must not dilute or sell their holdings in Shirpur. Sebi noted that Shirpur had allegedly devised a scheme to divert funds from debtors to entities within the promoter group. \u201cIt appears that the main reason for Shirpur's defaults to lenders is non-receipt of funds from its debtors amounting to 404 crore. The same appears to be part of a well-designed scheme devised by promoters to move the funds out of Shirpur and transfer to their accounts while misusing the IBC process,\u201d Bhatia had said in the order. Pradeep Sancheti, senior counsel representing Goenka, argued before the high court that KPMG was ineligible to submit a forensic report as it did not meet the eligibility criteria prescribed under Sebi's tender. He further contended that KPMG's report, submitted on 21 March 2023, could not be considered a \u2018forensic report\u2019 as directed, noting the absence of a mandatory Unique Document Identification Number (UDIN) and that KPMG was not listed as a registered firm with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). On behalf of Sebi, senior counsel Mustafa Doctor argued that if any adverse order was passed against Goenka, he had the option to appeal. Doctor emphasized that the challenge to the forensic auditor's appointment was merely a tactic to delay proceedings, given that Goenka had not challenged the interim order, despite it being a quasi-judicial order.",

        "Article Content": "Do you have multiple loans to repay and worry that settling them all will take a long time? While there are several strategies for managing debt, one option is to use a new to pay off . Although this approach may seem risky, and some might warn against it to avoid falling into a debt trap, it can be a practical solution under certain conditions. It might not be as bad an idea as some may make it appear. For example, if you have 2 lakh in with a 24 percent annual interest rate, 3 lakh in a personal loan at a 12 percent annual interest rate, and 1.5 lakh borrowed from a friend, sticking with the status quo may not always be the best choice. Now, the potential benefits are significant if you have an offer for a fresh personal loan at an of 10.5 percent. 1. A new loan with more favourable terms can reduce your overall interest payments. 2. A fresh loan with a lower amount and better terms may result in lower monthly due to a restarted tenure. 3. Consolidating multiple loans into one can ease the burden of handling numerous loan payments. 4. Personal loans are , meaning you do not need to provide collateral. \u201cSometimes people follow the rule of thumb where they are told to avoid taking a loan to repay a loan. However, there could be certain situations where this may be favourable, particularly when the rate of interest is lower, and the processing fee does not negate the saving,\u201d says Deepak Aggarwal, a Delhi-based chartered accountant and wealth advisor. \u201cHowever, the borrower must ensure that there are not too many hidden costs or a high cost of . The one-time cost can be staggered to compute the monthly cash outgo. That is the way to do a fair comparison,\u201d he adds. 1. Ensure that the processing fee is nominal and does not wipe out or offset the savings from consolidating your debt. 2. : Some banks may levy hidden fees or costs to woo new clients. Be careful about such charges before committing to a new loan. 3. : Be aware of whether the interest rate is fixed or variable. A variable rate would increase as the interest rates rise, affecting future payments. So, the interest rate ought to be fixed for a fair assessment. 4. : Switching to a smaller financial institution to save little money is not advisable. Consider sticking with established banks with extensive branch networks and efficient customer service unless the cost savings from a smaller institution are substantial.",

        "Article Content": "These are some of the classic hooks used by fraudsters to lure unsuspecting investors with promises of extraordinary returns. Sadly, these scams often target regions with low , like the Northeastern parts of India. Recently, Guwahati Police arrested several individuals who scammed people out of thousands of crores. These fraudsters, disguised as stock market experts, convinced people to invest with them by promising guaranteed . Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the tactics these scammers use, and most importantly, how you can safeguard yourself from falling into their trap. The first red flag is when these \u2018so-called\u2019 experts ask you to money into individual bank accounts instead of creating an investment account. These people will claim that direct payments will bypass middlemen and reduce fees which makes it sound appealing. However, when they take money in their personal accounts, it makes it easier for them to disappear with your money easily. Hence, it is essential to verify the credibility of the financial institution and ensure you're paying into a legitimate account. Before transferring any money, do thorough research on the company or individual you\u2019re dealing with. A quick search for reviews, complaints, or negative experiences could save you from being scammed. Remember, legitimate companies will never ask you to make payments into an individual\u2019s bank account. One of the most common tactics used by scammers is guaranteeing high monthly returns\u2014often as much as 10-12%. They also mention that they don\u2019t have to take any of the risk associated with stock market and trading. Investments that promise high returns with little to no risk are almost always fraudulent. However, most of us are aware that every investment including low risk investment options carry risk. Hence, it is important to ask detailed questions about where the money will be invested and how such returns will be generated. Be especially cautious if the answers seem vague or overly complex. Fraudsters often ask for large sums of money, presenting the opportunity as a once-in-a-lifetime chance that is only available to serious . This sense of exclusivity and urgency is a deliberate tactic to make you feel pressured into acting quickly. You may be told that the opportunity is only available to a limited number of people, increasing the fear of missing out (FOMO). In such cases, it\u2019s vital to take a step back and assess the situation logically. Ask why this opportunity requires such a large amount of money and compare it with similar investment opportunities. If others don\u2019t require such a high commitment, this should raise concerns. Avoid making decisions in haste, especially when large sums of money are involved. Scammers know that creating a sense of urgency can lead people to make impulsive decisions. By using phrases like \u201climited-time offer\u201d or \u201cact now before it\u2019s too late,\u201d they put pressure on investors to act quickly without fully understanding the investment. The fear of missing out can push individuals to make hasty decisions, often leading them straight into a scam. It's important to remember that legitimate investment opportunities don't require immediate decisions. Take your time to review the investment, consult with trusted financial advisors, and weigh the pros and cons carefully. If the opportunity is genuine, it will still be available after you've done your research. Scammers, on the other hand, rely on people rushing into decisions. Another common tactic is showcasing fake success stories of people who have supposedly made substantial profits. Fraudsters will often provide glowing testimonials from people who don\u2019t even exist or who are actually part of the scam. These stories are designed to make you believe that others have profited, encouraging you to follow suit. It\u2019s essential to verify any success stories by asking for documentation, credentials, and contact information that can be cross-checked. If you're unable to fact-check these individuals, you should be extremely cautious. These people often use images of a luxurious lifestyle to attract investors. They may flaunt expensive cars, exotic vacations, and lavish homes to create the illusion that their leads to extraordinary wealth. And, who doesn\u2019t want that? Instead of focusing on the lifestyle being portrayed, focus on understanding the investment itself. How does it generate returns? What is the risk involved? Analyzing the investment on its merits, rather than being dazzled by the promise of luxury, will help you avoid falling into this common scam. These people are skilled at preying on human weaknesses, particularly greed and vanity. They know their victim\u2019s trigger points and focus on that. If you find yourself eager to show off your supposed future investment gains, it may be a sign that you\u2019re being manipulated. It\u2019s essential to remain level-headed when considering any opportunity. Don\u2019t let emotions cloud your judgment. Instead, always research the opportunity and consult a financial expert to ensure it\u2019s legitimate. In conclusion, the best way to protect yourself from financial scams is to remain vigilant. Always conduct thorough research before making any investments, follow your instincts, and seek out reviews from credible sources. If you\u2019re ever in doubt, consult a professional financial advisor before transferring any money.",

        "Article Content": "Amid the growing excitement surrounding Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), investors are increasingly drawn to the high-growth potential these offerings present. SME IPOs have recently captured significant attention due to their substantial listing day gains. When evaluating investment options for long-term growth, choosing between blue-chip stocks and SME IPOs is critical. Blue-chip stocks are shares of large-cap companies renowned for their stability and reliability. These established companies have a strong track record of steady growth, making them a preferred choice for long-term investors who do not have the stomach for risk. In contrast, can be a good option for those willing to accept higher risks in exchange for greater returns. Market experts say that blue-chip stocks have the potential to deliver alpha returns\u2014returns that exceed the average market performance, whereas investing in SME IPOs during a bull market can be advantageous, especially if you are making a significant investment. In a bullish market, high-quality SME IPOs can offer substantial short-term gains. Ultimately, the choice between blue-chip stocks and SME IPOs hinges on an investor's risk tolerance and financial objectives. To clarify which option might be better suited for different types of investors, consulted market experts. \"Blue-chip and SME stocks offer different opportunities for long-term investing. Blue-chip stocks, or , are ideal for conservative investors seeking stability and consistent performance. They are less volatile and provide a reliable path to capital appreciation, even though they might not deliver the rapid growth seen with SME stocks. On the other hand, with their significant growth potential, SMEs carry higher risks due to their susceptibility to market fluctuations and operational challenges. Fundamentally strong SME stocks can be highly rewarding for those willing to accept these risks. However, conservative investors may prefer the stability and resilience of blue-chip stocks,\" said Dr Ravi Singh, SVP - Retail Research at Religare Broking. \"The stability of large-cap companies, as evidenced by the success of investors like Warren Buffett, highlights their value for long-term capital growth. Blue-chip stocks, though slower-growing compared to SME IPOs, offer steady gains and a strong foundation for a resilient investment portfolio. While SME IPOs can provide exciting opportunities, blue-chip stocks remain essential for investors looking to weather economic downturns and achieve reliable long-term returns,\" added Siddharth Maurya, Founder & Managing Director of Vibhavangal Anukulakara Private Limited. Several companies have achieved exceptional listing day gains in the SME IPO market, showcasing strong investor enthusiasm. Winsol Engineers Limited topped the list with a remarkable 411.00% gain on its debut, which took place on May 14, 2024. Close behind, Kay Cee Energy & Infra Limited saw a notable listing day gain of 343.33% when it was listed on January 5, 2024. Medicamen Organics Limited followed with a significant gain of 325.59% on June 28, 2024. GP Eco Solutions India Limited also performed exceptionally well, with a listing day gain of 318.88% on June 24, 2024. Rounding out the top five, Maxposure Limited achieved a 317.42% gain on its first trading day, January 23, 2024. These substantial gains reflect the strong market reception and investor interest in these SME IPOs.",

        "Article Content": "General Insurance has withdrawn its \u2018Medicare Protect Plan\u2019 with effect from September 5. The move will not impact customers who have to renew their policies within 90 days from the date of the withdrawal of the product. Tata joins SBI and HDFC Ergo, which announced withdrawal of its health insurance policies recently. While HDFC Ergo pulled out three variants of its \u2018Suraksha\u2019 policy in May, SBI announced in June that it is withdrawing its \u2018Arogya Plus\u2019 policy with effect from October 5. The withdrawal of \u2018Medicare Protect\u2019, which is a basic that comes with a sum insured of 2 lakh to 5 lakh offering a wide range of benefits including maternity cover, could lead to higher premiums for existing policyholders during migration, industry observers said. Here are a few things that you should know when your health insurance policy is withdrawn. When a policy is withdrawn, it simply means that it is not available for new purchases. \u00a0Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India ( ) has mandated that existing customers of a withdrawn product shall be provided a one-time option to renew the existing product if renewal falls within 90 days from the date of withdrawal of the product. \u201cPolicies due for renewal within 90 days from the date of withdrawal of the product would be eligible for renewal (i.e. policies with expiry date on or before Tuesday 3 December 2024). We request you to renew the policy before the expiry date to enjoy continuity of your insurance coverage,\u201d Tata AIG said in a communication to its policyholders. IRDAI has stipulated that policyholders can also migrate to any other suitable product (any other existing product or modified version of the withdrawn product) as per her/his choice. \u201cPolicies due for renewal 90 days after the withdrawal of the product (i.e. policies with expiry date on or after Wednesday 4 December 2024) will have the option to migrate to a suitable product,\u201d Tata AIG said. \u201cA separate product migration letter providing coverage, terms and conditions and premium details of the product would reach you before the renewal due date,\u201d it said. Policyholders will not lose any of their existing basic benefits due to the withdrawal. \u201cWe assure you that your continuity benefits with respect to pre-existing diseases waiting period, specified disease/procedure waiting period, 30 days waiting period and cumulative bonus would be transferred to the suitable health insurance product offered by Tata AIG as per the IRDAI provisions,\u201d the insurer said in its communication. But Medicare Protect's policyholders may not get the same set of features when they migrate/port to a new health insurance plan. Medicare Protect\u2019s family floater plan covers the proposer (self), spouse, three dependent children (up to 25 years of age) and two dependent parents. The policy even covers maternity expenses, which is capped at 50000 ( 60000 for girl child) and all payments made towards consumables (gloves, surgical kit etc.) during hospitalisation. The policy does not have co-payment where the has to pay a stipulated percentage of the claim amount. \u2018Medicare Protect\u2019 also offers \u2018restoration benefits\u2019 wherein an additional amount equivalent to the base sum insured will be restored if the original cover is exhausted due to high claims. The option is available once during the policy period. Medical expenses incurred for in-patient treatment for AYUSH (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) are also covered under the policy. Since the insurer has withdrawn the product, a new product that the chooses will have a different premium. Some experts believe that the migration would result in higher premiums. \u201cCustomers will be migrated to other suitable insurance products! Indirect way to move customers to superior products to increase the premiums,\u201d Nikhil Jha, who follows the life and health insurance sectors closely, posted on X (formerly Twitter). \u201cSame happened with HDFC ergo, suraksha policy moved to optima restore and my premium was increased from 18K to 26K,\u201d a user wrote on X. \u201cI think it's important to look at the bigger picture. Are they really putting their customers first, or are they just trying to boost their bottom line? Apply common sense,\u201d another user said on X.",

        "Article Content": "Many investors are comfortable with equity and channel their surplus funds into real estate to gain the twin benefits of appreciation and rental income on such property. On the other hand, some people do not prefer to invest in a house for personal use and instead opt to pay rent for their accommodation. I discuss income tax laws around and rent received in this article. The higher of either the rent received, or the amount the property could reasonably be rented for is treated as annual value. The municipal taxes you've paid are first deducted from this annual value to determine the A flat deduction of 30 percent of the annual value (after municipal taxes), is allowed in respect of all rented properties. Under the old tax regime, you could claim a deduction for full interest paid on loans used for the property's purchase, construction, repair, or reconstruction under Section 24 (b) for rented property. Please note that you can only set off a loss under the \u2018house property\u2019 head upto 2 lakh against other income. Any remaining unabsorbed loss during the current year can be carried forward against house property income for eight subsequent years. Under the new tax regime, you can claim interest paid on loans up to the taxable amount of rental income. No losses can be removed under the \u2018house property\u2019 head. As per the recent budget, rental income from house property can only be taxed under the \u201cincome from house property\u201d head. If you sublet the property, the income becomes taxable under \u201cIncome from other sources.\u201d Regarding loans taken on the under-construction property, interest deductions are allowed starting from the year in which the possession of the house is taken, with the deduction covering the full year even if possession is taken on the last day of the financial year. Interest paid during the construction period can be claimed in five equal annual instalments beginning from the year construction was completed and possession taken. So, if you transfer the house within five years from the end of the year in which possession was taken, you lose your right to claim interest for that period. For jointly owned property, the rental income is taxed based on each owner's share of contribution towards the property's purchase. This doesn't have to be an equal split. So, if your spouse\u2019s name is added as a joint holder for smooth succession purposes without contributing to the property, no rental income can be taxed in her name. Many taxpayers incorrectly attribute rental income to their wife because she is listed as a joint holder of the property without any contribution\u2014this is patently wrong. All salaried persons who receive House Rent Allowance (HRA) from their employer can claim deductions on rent paid for accommodation they occupy but do not own. The deduction is restricted to the lowest of the following three: 1. HRAreceived 2. 50 percent of the basic salary for metro city residents, 40 percent for non-metro 3. Excess of rent paid over 10 percent of basic salary. This deduction is also available only under the old tax regime. As per the tax laws, there is no restriction on a person claiming both benefits, provided they satisfy the conditions prescribed in the respective sections. For example, if you stay in a house far away from your workplace and pay both EMI on your own house and rent for a separate residence, you can claim both deductions, even if your own house is not rented out. Like salaried people, self-employed individuals can claim a rent deduction under Section 80GG for rent paid that exceeds 10 percent of their total income, subject to a limit of Rs. 5,000 per month or 25% of total income, whichever is lower. This deduction is not available if the taxpayer owns any self-occupied property anywhere or if he, his spouse, his HUF, or dependent members own a house in the same place where he is staying. For individuals and HUF engaged in business or profession, with an annual turnover exceeding 1 crore (for business) or 50 lakh (for professionals), they must deduct tax at 10 per cent on rent payments during the year if the total rent paid exceeds 2.40 lakh annually. Other individuals must deduct tax at 2 percent if the monthly rent exceeds 50,000. A TAN number is not required, but the landlord's PAN must be used to file the TDS return online. For rent paid to non-residents, there is no minimum threshold limit for rent, and tax must be deducted from the first rupee of rent paid. Tax is deducted at 30 percent on 70 percent of the rent paid to a non-resident. Please note that if you are paying rent to a non-resident, you must obtain a TAN number and deduct tax at source even if the monthly rent payable is below 50,000, as there is no threshold limit for payment to a non-resident.",

By issuing a circular dated August 27, the ) has announced that this UPI Lite feature will soon go live with effect from October 31 this year. The UPI Lite balance will be automatically reloaded by an amount chosen by the user. This is meant to facilitate the PIN-less transactions below 500 with a maximum UPI Lite balance limit of 2,000 at any point of time. However, it is vital to note that the reloading will not lead to exceeding of UPI Lite balance limit, which is 2,000. Additionally, the users will also be able to revoke the auto top-up mandate at any time, reads the NPCI circular. It is a that enables users of UPI to make small-value transactions (below 500) without entering the PIN. These transactions take place without using the remitter\u2019s bank\u2019s core banking systems, thus leading to uncluttered passbook for users. On UPI Lite, user can simply open the app and make the payment without having to enter the PIN. 1. NPCI has directed that the issuer banks will support the functionality of auto top-up on UPI Lite wherein the banks should allow creation of UPI Lite mandate and allow debits whenever the request comes from the PSP/App. 2. NPCI has also directed that the UPI apps will support the necessary functionality and interface on their app in order for customers to use auto top-up on UPI Lite. 3. Additionally, members are supposed to ensure that the mandate created are executed successfully. All the necessary validation should be present at the time of mandate creation. 4. But the number of auto-replenishment transactions are to be restricted to five in a day for each UPI Lite account. NPCI is projecting UPI Lite as a customer-friendly approach to enable low-value transactions without utilising a remitter bank\u2019s core banking systems in real-time, while providing adequate risk mitigation.",

        "Article Content": "Health insurance plans offered by banks or mobile apps are often cheaper because they are typically group plans. These plans are available exclusively to members of a specific group, such as bank account holders or KYC-approved app users. While these plans may appear attractive due to their lower cost, it is important to be aware of their limitations and potential drawbacks: In summary, while group plans may seem like an attractive option due to their lower cost, it\u2019s important to be aware of their limitations and risks. Ensure you understand the full implications before committing to a plan. The moratorium period for health insurance policies in India, which was reduced to 60 months in April 2024, plays a crucial role in claim acceptance. During this period, insurers cannot deny a claim based on non-disclosure or incorrect information, except in cases where fraud is proven. Meaning, insurers can still deny a claim if they can prove fraud. What constitutes fraud? Well, under the Indian Contract Act of 1872, fraud is defined as any act intended to deceive or induce someone into a contract. This includes: In essence, fraud involves intentionally deceiving someone for personal benefit. So, for an insurer to reject a claim after the moratorium period, they will need to provide documentary evidence proving: If an insurer denies your claim alleging fraud after the 60-month moratorium period, you might need to challenge their decision in court. And, the insurer will have to prove their fraud claims with solid evidence.",

        "Article Content": "Funding is one of the biggest requirements for most businesses to survive or sustain. Funding can come from equity, debt, or other sources. Many organisations rely on for their various needs. Lenders consider several parameters to decide whether the business is eligible for a loan and what should be the interest rate charged. Let us look at some factors lenders consider to determine the interest rate on business loans. Factors considered for determining the interest rate on business loans: Banks and NBFCs use the credit score to determine the borrower's creditworthiness. Based on the , they decide whether the loan should be given and at what interest rate. A credit score of 750 and above is considered healthy for a loan. The higher the credit score, the better. If the credit score is higher than a specified number, some banks may offer a loan at a lower interest rate and better terms. The bank may consider a low credit score as a sign of poor credit history. Such profiles are considered risky. The bank may either decline the loan proposal or insist on collateral or offer the loan at a higher interest rate. To improve your credit score, always pay all loan and bills on time. Apart from timely repayments, maintain a credit utilisation ratio of 30% or lower, maintain a healthy mix of secured and unsecured credit, don\u2019t apply for a loan with multiple banks/NBFCs simultaneously or within a short duration, etc. The security against which the loan is availed is known as collateral. If your business loan is secured with , the interest rate charged will be lower than an unsecured loan. The security offered can be related to your business, such as machinery, stock, etc., or personal, such as your residential property, etc. The type of loan influences the interest rate. For example, a secured loan is offered at a lower interest rate, and an unsecured loan is offered at a higher interest rate. Similarly, whether the business loan comes under priority sector lending or not influences the interest rate. For example, business loans related to agriculture, MSMEs, education, housing, social infrastructure, renewable energy, etc., come under priority sector lending. Banks have targets for priority sector lending. Hence, if your business comes under priority sector lending, your business loan may get some preference and may come at a lower interest rate than other business loans. Another important consideration in the business loan interest rate is the type of loan: fixed or floating. In a fixed-interest rate loan, the EMI stays constant. A floating interest rate is linked to a benchmark like the repo rate. As the repo rate changes, the interest rate on the loan will be revised. A fixed-rate business loan comes at a higher interest rate than a floating interest rate business loan. The current economic environment plays an important role in determining the market interest rates and, thereby, the on your loan. In a high inflation period, the market interest rates will be high, and hence, the interest rate on your business loan will be high. Similarly, in a low inflation period, the market interest rates will be low. Hence, you may get a business loan at a low interest rate. The bank will check the nature of the business to see if it is seasonal or speculative. Such businesses are considered riskier than others. Business loans to such firms come at a higher interest rate than others. The business history, i.e., the number of years it has existed, also plays an important role. The longer the business has existed, the more the number of business cycles it has survived. The long history of existence shows the business is resilient and can survive adverse economic conditions. The bank will analyse the business financials to determine the loan and interest rate. They will check the business balance sheet (assets and liabilities), profit and loss account, margins, cash flows, etc. If the business is profitable and generates healthy cash flows, the probability of getting a loan at a lower interest rate increases. The bank will also check the existing leverage, i.e. existing loans, and how much more leverage the business can handle. Along with the loan application, the bank may ask you to submit a business plan. The plan should have details like the purpose of the loan, the revenue and margin targets, the expected cash flows, etc. Make sure the business plan is robust. Do you have an existing relationship with the lender in the form of current accounts, deposits, or loans? If yes, the lender may give you the benefit of the existing relationship by offering a business loan at a lower interest rate than other borrowers. Business-related and external factors influence the business loan interest rate. You have no control over external factors like the current economic environment. If inflation is high, the interest rates will be higher. However, business-related factors like credit score, collateral, loan tenure, business financials, etc., are in your control. You can work on these factors and put your best foot forward to get a business loan at the lowest possible rate. When applying for a business loan, it is recommended that you compare the interest rate and loan features of various banks and NBFCs. You can do this online. Based on this comparison, you can shortlist 2-3 banks/NBFCs. You can meet their executives and take the discussion forward. You can then compare the loan offers from these banks/NBFCs and choose the one that suits your business requirements.",

        "Article Content": "Can banks charge you a joining fee even before your credit card is activated? They cannot as the credit card account will not be created unless the card is activated. With complaints about banks charging a joining fee even before the card is activated, unsolicited cards being issued and the undue delay in closing the card account even after a formal request from the customer, here are a few things that you must know about credit card activation and related rules. A credit card is activated only when the customer does an authentication confirming her/his willingness in owning the card through an (one-time password) sent to her/his mobile number. The card will be considered activated even if you do not do any financial transaction. For instance, if you just set a PIN for the card, but do not use the card, it will be considered activated. \u201cIn addition to financial transactions, any process initiated by the cardholder such as generation of statement, change of PIN, change in transaction controls, etc., shall be considered for treating a card as \u2018used\u2019,\u201d (Reserve Bank of India) said in its circular on credit cards. However, any calls made to the customer care centre, for reasons other than those cited above, shall not be considered towards usage of a card, it said. \u201cCustomer-initiated processes indicating intent to use a credit card such as PIN generation, modification of transaction control, Interactive Voice Response, recorded call to the customer care centre and SMS may be considered as activation,\u201d RBI said. Yes. If you do not activate your for more than 30 days from the day it was issued, card issuers will seek an OTP-based consent. \u201cIf the card is not activated by the cardholder for more than 30 days from the date of issuance, card-issuers shall seek OTP based consent,\u201d RBI said. \u201cIf the cardholder does not provide consent, the card issuer has to close the credit card account within seven days of seeking consent,\u201d it said. Any request to close the credit card should be processed within seven working days if there are no outstanding dues. Unsolicited credit cards are a dime a dozen these days. But you have to be careful with such cards as any unintentional act will activate the card. You should never give a consent for activating the unsolicited card either through an OTP or other modes. \u201cIf the customer receives an unsolicited card, she/he should refrain from activating or providing consent for activation of the card through OTP or any other means. If no consent is received for activating the card, the card-issuer is required to close the credit card account without any cost to the customer within seven working days from the date of seeking confirmation from the customer and shall also intimate the customer that the credit card account has been closed,\u201d RBI said in its circular. \u201cSubsequent to receiving the intimation from the card-issuer that the card account has been closed, the customer shall destroy the card. Further, the customer may file a complaint with the card-issuer against the issuance of unsolicited card and escalate it to the RBI Ombudsman as per \u2018Integrated Ombudsman Scheme\u2019,\u201d the apex bank said. No. Unused cards will not have any impact on your . But there have been cases of information on unused cards being reported to credit bureaus. The RBI has said that card issuers should pull out such information within a month. \u201cCredit card issuers can report information of a new credit card to credit bureaus only after the card is activated. Any information related to inactive reported to credit bureaus has to be withdrawn within 30 days from the date of sharing the details,\u201d the apex bank said. No. The two are completely different. Deactivation and blocking of the card is a temporary measure done to shield the customer from any unauthorised usage due to loss/theft or other reasons. \u201cDe-activation/Blocking of a credit card temporarily curtails the ability of a cardholder to make any transaction in a credit card account while still maintaining the credit/account relationship with the card-issuer,\u201d RBI said. \u201cClosure of a credit card on the other hand amounts to termination of the account-based relationship between the cardholder and the card-issuer,\u201d it said. If you have unpaid dues on your credit card but still want to close it, there is a prescribed procedure. \u201cIn case payment towards dues is outstanding, the card-issuer shall provide details regarding such outstanding dues to the cardholder upon receipt of the closure request without waiting for completion of the billing cycle and accordingly advise her/him to make payment in order to complete the closure process,\u201d RBI said. \u201cIn such cases, the prescribed timeline of seven working days shall be calculated after excluding the number of days taken by the cardholder to clear the outstanding dues,\u201d it said.",

        "Article Content": "The early resumes of tech titans Steve Jobs and Bill Gates have recently re-emerged on social media, offering a unique window into the beginnings of two individuals who went on to to revolutionize the technology industry. These documents, crafted when the future innovators were just 18 years old, shed light on their early interests and skills before they became household names. Steve Jobs' 1973 resume reveals his budding fascination with electronics and technology, long before he co-founded Apple. At the time, Jobs was a student at Reed College in Oregon and highlighted his proficiency in areas such as computers, calculators, and design. Notably, when asked about phone access, Jobs wrote \"None,\" and while he confirmed having a driver\u2019s license, he described his transportation prospects as \"possible, but not probable.\" On the other hand, ' 1971 resume reflects his early expertise in programming languages, including FORTRAN, COBOL, and BASIC, along with his familiarity with computers like the PDP-10, PDP-8, and CDC-6400. Gates, who listed his salary at the time as $3,500, also mentioned his collaboration with Paul G. Allen, his childhood friend who would later co-found Microsoft with him. The resume notes their joint project designing a \"system for traffic engineers to study traffic flow.\" These vintage resumes were shared on X (formerly ) by Jon Erlichman, a TV host at BNN Bloomberg and Bloomberg Markets, with the caption, \"Steve Jobs and Bill Gates\u2019 resumes at age 18.\" The post quickly gained traction, sparking discussions among users who shared their thoughts and reactions. One commenter noted, \"This is history. It\u2019s fantastic!\" while another found the documents \"fascinating.\" Observing the differences between the two resumes, a user remarked, \"That\u2019s funny\u2026 Jobs\u2019 resume is hand-written and sloppy, and Gates\u2019 resume is all organized and type-written.\" Another user summed up the significance of the documents by calling them \"probably the 2 most impactful resumes of this generation.\" Steve Jobs would go on to co-found in his parents\u2019 garage in 1976, later driving its resurgence with iconic products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad before his death on October 5, 2011. Bill Gates co-founded Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975, leading it to become the world\u2019s largest software company. Gates is also widely recognized for his philanthropic endeavors.",

In an email to employees on Friday, Dunzo said it would pay pending salaries, severance, leave encashment and other dues to affected staffers as soon as it receives funds. has seen a copy of the email. The company had also considered the option of entering other lines of businesses that complement its core merchants business, and have the ability to make money soon and are operationally light, the two persons added, adding that Dunzo was hopeful the business would turn around in September on the back of its business-to-business segment. Dunzo is yet to pay salaries including full and final settlements to several former employees. In September, Dunzo partnered with payroll servicing firm OneTap to disburse salaries for certain months. \u201cWe are trying our best to end this transaction at the earliest. It\u2019s a complicated one and has multiple hops. I am sorry for constantly saying sorry even. But given our current situation, few levers stay in our hands, and I apologise,\u201d Biswas had said in an internal message to employees in May. \u201cI really do wish to reach a point, where we can stop with the daily/monthly anxieties around salary payments - and hoping the next fortnight allows us to wrap up everything, so that May is the last month of us having to manage this crisis,\u201d the CEO added.

However, it soon ran out of money given the cash-guzzling nature of the business. Dunzo then increased focus on its merchant services business, called Dunzo for Business, as well as its customer-to-customer parcel delivery business to turn around its fortunes. The company, which was on its path to becoming a unicorn, or a company with a valuation of at least $1 billion in 2022, reported a substantial net loss of 1,802 crore in FY23. As of January 2022, Dunzo was valued at about $775 million. Also read |",

In a post on X, he cited a study by the market regulator Sebi on investor participation in IPOs. \u201cGujarat accounts for about 9% of the total investor customer base, but they account for 40% of IPO participation in both retail and HNI categories. IPO flipping (trading) in the Gujju genes,\u201d he wrote on X. According to the Sebi report, Gujarat had the highest number of retail investors, 39.3 per cent, followed by Maharashtra, 13.5 per cent, and Rajasthan, 10.5 per cent. Regarding initial public offering participation, the report observed that 70 per cent of IPO investors were from the top four states: Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The non-institutional investors (NII) from Gujarat received about 42.3 per cent of the total allotment in the NII Category, followed by Maharashtra with 20.4 per cent and Rajasthan with 15.5 per cent. According to the report, the overall IPO market activities were buoyant from FY22 to FY24 due to higher retail participation, as seen in a number of applications and oversubscriptions. \u201cThe success of the IPOs was partly supported by overall positive market sentiments and was further boosted by strong post listing performance in some of the IPOs,\u201d it said. Out of the 144 IPOs listed between April 2021 and December 2023, 75 per cent gave positive returns. Almost 92 IPOs were oversubscribed by more than ten times, and only 2 IPOs were undersubscribed. Additionally, the report stated that increased accounts also drove a rise in public issues after the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost half of the demat accounts that applied for IPOs during this period were started during the post-COVID period. After the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s guidelines on IPO financing by NBFCs, stated that the over-subscription rate in the NII category declined 17 times from 38 times.",

        "Article Content": "Tech billionaire 's older answer to what question he asks candidates or applicants has recently gained attention and pushed the spotlight on job interviews. The particular question seeks to distinguish the truth tellers from the liars, according to a New York Post report. At the 2017 World Government Summit, , who now owns auto major Tesla, space exploration company SpaceX and social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), said he has a \u201cfavourite\u201d question for candidates at interviews. The question? This: \u201cTell me about some of the most difficult you worked on and how you solved them.\u201d His reasoning? This: \"Because the people who really solved the problem know exactly how they solved it. They know and can describe the little details.\u201d is looking to check if a candidate can truly solve a problem they claimed to have solved, as per a CNBC report. \u201cOf course you want to make sure if there was some significant accomplishment, were they really responsible, or was someone else more responsible? Usually, someone who really had to struggle with a problem, they really understand [the details], and they don\u2019t forget,\u201d Musk told Auto Bild. The NY Post report noted that Musk's theory can be proved using the \u201cAsymmetric Information Management (AIM) approach.\u201d In the field of Applied Cognitive , AIM encourages those speaking the truth to give more details. As per the CNBC report, using AIM can increase chances of detecting liars by 70 per cent. Cody Porter, one of the authors of a study on the subject, published in the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition in December 2020, and Senior Teaching Fellow at the University of Portsmouth, said that small details are the \"lifeblood\" when determining to check. \"Liars will provide little to no detail to conceal their guilt, which could be perceived as strategically withholding information when the AIM method is introduced. Their assumption here is that providing more information will make it easier for the investigator to detect their lie, so instead, they provide less information,\u201d Porter wrote.",

Murthy said his brother still fondly remembers that act of and this experience taught him that \"true joy lies in sharing and caring for others\". Murthy also spoke to the children about and recalled his headmaster's response to being \"stingy\" with something as cheap as salt during a chemistry experiment, as per the report. The message? \"This common salt belongs to everyone in this school, not just me. We must treat it with care, as it is community property.\" Murthy said this \"shaped his approach to founding and running Infosys\".

He added that decisions should be based on what benefits the team, the report said. Further, on leadership and responsibility, Murthy recalled his boss Colin, who, during his time in Paris, helped him restore a system and praised him for his dedication without mentioning his own sacrifice, as per the report. He taught me a crucial leadership lesson: take full responsibility for failures and share the glory with your team. These lessons remain invaluable even today,\" Murthy said.",

According to Bill Gates, many disturbances in the world today could lead to a major war, and even if the war is avoided, a pandemic is possible, most likely in the next 25 years. He said that in case of a pandemic, the major question is whether nations are prepared enough compared to the outbreak in 2020. He feels that the nations were unprepared for the global outbreak of 2020. In a conversation with CNBC Make it, said, \u201cThe country that the world expected to lead and be the model fell short of those expectations,\u201d referring to the United States. In 2022, Bill Gates wrote the book, \u201cHow to Prevent the Next Pandemic\u201d in which he called out several governments for being unprepared in 2020 to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak. In his book, he also suggested ways for countries worldwide to deal with the pandemic. These included stringent quarantining policies, efficient disease monitoring mechanisms, and boosting vaccine research and development. \u201cAlthough some of the lessons from the coronavirus pandemic have been learned, it\u2019s been way less than I would expect, sadly. Getting our thoughts together about what we did well, what we didn\u2019t do well, is still not happening .... Perhaps, in the next five years, that\u2019ll get better. But, so far, it\u2019s quite surprising,\u201d Gates said while referring to the pandemic. In the upcoming Netflix series\"What's Next? The Future with Bill Gates,\" the Billionaire will explore measures to avoid a pandemic. This isn\u2019t the first time Bill Gates has expressed his concerns about the pandemic. Earlier, he expressed his worries about the pandemic on various public platforms. In 2022, at Germany\u2019s annual Munich Security Conference, he said that the risks of Covid-19 have \u201cdramatically reduced\u201d, but it is very certain that the world will see another pandemic.",

When compared to the previous quarter, the revenue saw a significant decline of 76.24%, and the loss surged by 167.22%.

The company\u2019s standalone payments business also reported an adjusted PAT of 710 crore for FY24 against a loss of 194 crore a year earlier, PhonePe said in a statement on Monday. If ESOPs are included, PhonePe reported a loss. ESOPs or employee stock options, used as a tool to reward or retain employees, can have a substantial cost and tax burden for the company and employees. PhonePe didn't offer details of its ESOPs costs. PhonePe's revenues rose 74% to 5,064 crore during the year, driven by factors including its ability to cross-sell a diverse product portfolio, the statement said. \u201cOur financial strategy is anchored on three key pillars: (1) predictable and sustainable growth in revenue, (2) diversification of revenue streams, and (3) continuing improvements to the bottom line,\u201d PhonePe\u2019s chief financial officer Adarsh Nahata said. These factors, he said, have helped the company scale rapidly while maintaining a focus on profitability. Walmart-backed PhonePe said driving operations by automation and other cost efficiencies helped improve revenue and profit during the year. \u201cWe believe a focus on disciplined financial management will help us continue in the progression towards profitability of our Payments business,\u201d the company\u2019s founder and chief executive officer Sameer Nigam said in the statement.

This is a new payment option that allows customers at the time of checkout through PhonePe\u2019s Payment Gateway. Last year, the company announced its entry into the stock broking business through its Share.Market app, which allows users to trade and invest in stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs (exchange-traded funds). It competes with other giants such as Groww and Zerodha in this category. PhonePe also has a commerce vertical called Pincode which focuses on several categories within and outside the open network for digital commerce or ONDC platform. Founded by Nigam, Rahul Chari and Burzin Engineer in 2015, PhonePe has established itself as a leading consumer payments app with 550+ million registered users and a digital payments acceptance network of 40+ million merchants. It processes over 270 million daily transactions with an annualised total payment value (TPV) of over $1.5 trillion. Backed by General Atlantic and Tencent, among others, it shifted its domicile to India from Singapore in 2022. In the same year, PhonePe, which was acquired by Flipkart, separated its ownership from the e-commerce firm, although Walmart continues to remain the parent company for both.",

        "Article Content": "Wall Street and investors were \"unimpressed\" by chipmaker quarterly earnings forecast released on August 28, Reuters reported. Despite the growth and profits, the reception of the forecast has been mixed. Nvidia's shares fell 6 per cent in after-trading hours on August 28, pulling other tech down as well \u2014 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom also fell. Shares of Nvidia's biggest customers \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Microsoft, also dipped less than 1 per cent in after-hours trading on August 28. On open today (August 29), if Nvidia's shares continue to fall, the chipmaker is likely to lose $175 billion in market value. Nvidia expects an adjusted gross margin of 75 per cent, plus or minus 50 basis points, in the third . According to LSEG data, analysts, on average, forecast a gross margin of 75.5 percent. It reported a 75.7 per cent gross margin in the second quarter versus an average estimate of 75.8 per cent. It forecast revenue of $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2 per cent, for the third quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of $31.77 billion, according to LSEG data. Q2 was $30.04 billion, beating estimates of $28.70 billion. Nvidia's stock saw a dizzying rise this year \u2014 up over 150 per cent, adding a market value of $1.82 trillion and pulling up the broader S&P 500 to . Investors thus had high expectations for the billions pushed into the generative artificial intelligence (AI) business, it added. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group, felt that the previous results had set the bar high for Nvidia. He said, \"Here's the issue: The size of the beat this time was much smaller than we've been seeing. Even future guidance was raised, but again, not by the tune from previous quarters. This is a great company that is still growing revenue at 122 per cent, but it appears the bar was just set a tad too high this season.\" The revenue and gross margin forecast for the current quarter were not far from analysts' expectations but did not trump Wall Street targets. For context, in the last three consecutive quarters, Nvidia recorded revenue growth exceeding 200 per cent. However, the report added that its past success has inflated expectations even higher, given the company's \u201ccapacity to surpass estimates.\u201d Some investors fear that Nvidia's expectations-meeting forecast and \"slow payoffs\" could lead to a shake-up in the billions being invested into the space, the report said. \"It's a reflection of growing jitters about the long-term viability of the generative AI market, with the entire market seemingly hinging on Nvidia's performance,\" eMarketer analyst Jacob Bourne told Reuters. Notably, Nvidia's biggest customers \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft \u2014 are expected to spend over $200 billion this year, mostly on building AI infrastructure, such as data centres, it added. Nvidia is also facing scrutiny about its practices. It said that it received requests for information from regulators in the United States and South Korea, on \"sales of GPUs, efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation models.\" Earlier, the company had noted inquiries only from the European Union, the United Kingdom and China. In July, Reuters reported that France's antitrust regulator was also set to charge Nvidia for alleged anticompetitive practices.",

        "Article Content": "Ola Electric, which marked its stock market debut last week, saw its revenue rise nearly 29% year-on-year to 1,644 crore in the quarter ended June, helped by accelerated deliveries of scooters, while its loss widened to 347 crore. The Bhavish Aggarwal-led electric scooter maker had registered a revenue of 1,598 crore in the March quarter, with a net loss of 416 crore. In the year-ago quarter, the company\u2019s net loss stood at 267 crore. Ola Electric ramped up deliveries of its mass-market scooter portfolio (S1 X) during the quarter, which helped accelerate growth, it said in a statement on Wednesday. The existing product portfolio, including the S1 Pro, S1 Air and S1 X+, also saw strong demand during the quarter. Also read | \u201cThe increasing scale of operations has benefited the company in the form of lower manufacturing costs and supply chain optimizations. These benefits of scale are further amplified by the company\u2019s scalable platform-based product development and manufacturing technology that results in high degrees of commonality across its products,\u201d the company said. Ola Electric\u2019s shares were listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) at the issue price of 76 on Friday. The stock has since been rising, hitting a life high of nearly 130 on Tuesday before coming off. On Wednesday, the stock closed 2.6% higher at 110.99 on the NSE. An offer for sale (OFS) of up to 84,941,997 equity shares and a fresh issue of up to 5,500 crore were included in the initial public offering (IPO) by the leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer in the country. Read more | Ola Electric also announced the integration of its cells in its own vehicles by Q1 FY26 to help the company reduce its dependence on imported components and lower production costs. \u201cThe cell has been a very core anchor of our strategy to drive lower cost and as a result higher penetration for EVs in India. The cell makes up about 30-35% of the vehicle cost. As we start manufacturing this in India, over time, we believe we can save over 20% of that 30% and all of that flows down to the bottom line,\u201d Aggarwal, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive officer (CEO), said while addressing a virtual press conference on Wednesday evening. The cells will get fully tested and integrated into the company\u2019s vehicles by Q1 FY26, according to Aggarwal. \u201cWe have produced more than 30,000 cells and month-on-month, we are ramping up the production,\u201d he said. The next few quarters will see incremental gross margin improvements, he said, adding that the big step function change on gross margins will happen with the company manufacturing its own cell, for which production has already started. On Thursday, the company plans to launch a portfolio of motorbikes across mass and premium segments that, according to Aggarwal, will be delivered by the end of this financial year. Aggarwal noted that the cost structure for the motorbikes and the gross margins will start where the scooter already is. \u201cOur motorbikes are built on the same platform as our scooters. So, a lot of the components like electronics, cell and battery, motor and powertrain\u2014all of them are the same as the scooter.\u201d \u201cThe manufacturing capacity that we have is fungible across scooter and motorbikes. So, we won\u2019t need to do any large-scale capex to scale motorbikes into the existing capacity that we have,\u201d he added.",

        "Article Content": "A new report by UBS analysts suggests that products on Flipkart Minutes, which is the newest player in the quick commerce sector, are priced about 10 percent lower than those on Blinkit, the current market leader. Launched in August in select parts of Bengaluru, Flipkart Minutes is using introductory discounts\u2014a strategy often employed by new entrants like Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), Amazon, Ola, and Swiggy\u2014to generate demand and build customer loyalty. Companies adopting this strategy typically reduce discounts once they've established themselves and built a substantial user base. For Flipkart, entering the quick commerce sector with Minutes is now more feasible, given that the market has matured with enough players over the past three and a half years. \u201cOverall, Flipkart seems to be replicating the model that has now been proven successful, in terms of the look and feel of the app, the user interface and layout, product categories as well as the monetisation models, delivery fees, platform fees, etc.,\u201d UBS said in its note. As the quick commerce industry becomes increasingly competitive, differentiated product pricing is crucial for newcomers like Flipkart Minutes to distinguish themselves from established players such as , Swiggy Instamart, Zepto, and Big Basket, and to attract customers from these platforms, the report said. \u201cWhile the lower pricing could be an initial market entry strategy, we will keep an eye on prices as Flipkart expands this offering to more areas within Bangalore and to other cities. A 10% lower cost, which in effect could be in line with DMart prices, could be a good value proposition to attract customers,\u201d it added. For Flipkart, maintaining and offering these discounts will be more manageable due to its larger size and extensive experience in this space, which provides it with greater leverage in negotiations with brands. During s Q4FY24 earnings call, Albinder Dhindsa, CEO of Blinkit said he doesn't believe in discounting. \"...our focus is to build a valuable service that customers actually are willing to pay more for rather than trying to provide an inferior service and leaning on discounting to grow. And that will be our strategy going forward as well,\" the firm said. Walmart-owned Flipkart was compelled to enter the quick commerce sector to fend off competition and protect its market position. Although Flipkart leads the e-commerce market, surpassing Amazon, Nykaa, Ajio, and others according to various industry estimates, it has yet to secure a significant share in the quick commerce space. As of July, led the quick commerce market with a 40-45 percent share, followed by Swiggy Instamart at 20-25 percent. Zepto ranked third with a 15-20 percent share, ahead of Big Basket (BB Now), which held a 10-15 percent market share, according to UBS.",

        "Article Content": "Flipkart has rolled out a new payments app, super.money, to enable users to make payments via Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and earn cashback, rekindling its ambition to gain a stronghold in the fintech space. This comes nearly two-and-a-half years after the Flipkart Group, which owns e-commerce marketplace Flipkart, travel booking firm Cleartrip, and fashion brand Myntra, , aiming to create two independent entities with Walmart as the majority shareholder of both the businesses. Flipkart launched its super.money app in beta or test mode in June, and said it has handled 10 million transactions and 1 million downloads since. The app will offer users up to 5% cashback on every merchant transaction and special offers on transactions done on partner platforms such as Myntra and Flipkart. The entity also plans to launch a credit on UPI offering by partnering with the National Payments Corporation of India\u2019s UPI infrastructure for a co-branded credit card, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Credit on UPI is expected to boost borrowings by individuals, especially with borrowers from tier 2 and tier 3 cities likely to join the realm of formal credit, the company said. Prakash Sikaria, founder and chief executive of super.money, told the company was looking to draw in first-time borrowers, attempting to formalise credit among users who may not have availed any form of credit yet, including credit cards. \u201cThe TG (target group) we are going after is the one that has not got an unsecured card ever. They don\u2019t have a Visa, Mastercard or Rupay card. If you give a product to someone who has not ever experienced it, they are more forgiving and the adoption is better,\u201d Sikaria said. For every card issued, four applicants are rejected, offering a sizeable market for super.money to tap, according to Sikaria. The company aims to be among the top 5 UPI players by December, the executive told . to double down on the consumer payments space, marking its third acquisition in the segment after NGPay (Jigrahak Mobility Solutions Pvt. Ltd) in 2014, and FX Mart Pvt. Ltd, which owned a prepaid wallet licence. E-commerce major Flipkart launched its own UPI handle in March to offer cashback up to 5% on payments. Super.money, however, will continue to operate independently, Sikaria said, noting that it does not view Flipkart\u2019s UPI offering as competition. \u201cEveryone has a merchant UPI today. They are all embedding UPIs in their workflows. They are not building a UPI-first fintech player and that distinction will remain. It\u2019s not a competing strategy, it\u2019s a complementary one,\u201d Sikaria added. Super.money has partnered with several financial institutions to offer financial services. The app is currently available on Google\u2019s Android operation system and is expected to be rolled out on Apple\u2019s iOS shortly. \u201cWe have started with innovating on credit products as it does an important job of introducing millions of Indians to formal credit infrastructure,\u201d Sikaria said.",

New investors Dragon Fund and Epiq Capital joined the round while existing investors StepStone, Lightspeed, DST and Contrary increased their stakes. The Mumbai-based company has raced its way to bag some of the biggest funding rounds so far this year, as it reshapes India\u2019s e-commerce sector forcing giants including Walmart-backed Flipkart and Tata\u2019s BigBasket to venture into instant deliveries. Also read | According to Aadit Palicha, founder and chief executive officer of Zepto, the new round will enable the firm to strengthen its balance sheet as it gears up to deliver \u201crobust growth and operating leverage.\u201d \u201cWhile these recent financings reflect strong confidence in Zepto\u2019s performance to date, we recognize there is still a lot of execution ahead of us to fulfil our ambition of building a world-class internet company out of India. At Zepto, we genuinely feel we are just at the beginning of our journey,\u201d Palicha said on Friday. The deal also marks one of the first investments by General Catalysts following the . The merged entity plans to invest $500 million to $1 billion across early- and growth-stage investments in the country, had reported in June. Zepto, which is gearing up for a public market listing next year, had gained its coveted unicorn status a year ago, when it raised $200 million at a valuation of $1.4 billion. India\u2019s quick-commerce market grew 77% in 2023 to reach $2.8 billion in gross merchandise value (GMV), accounting for 5% of India\u2019s overall e-commerce market, according to consulting firm Redseer. Also read | GMV, a key metric in e-commerce, tracks the total value of all the goods sold on a platform, not including discounts and other expenses. Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra founded Zepto in April 2021, when covid curfews had made people in India\u2019s large cities accustomed to buying daily staples online. The four-year-old startup is now gearing up for an initial public offering of its shares next year, , Palicha had told in June. Over the past few months, Zepto, Blinkit and Swiggy\u2019s Instamart have fuelled demand for instant deliveries, growing their network of dark stores and expanding their range of products. Zepto said it plans to use the capital to double the number of its dark stores, or warehouses, to 700 by March 2025. Meanwhile, Zomato\u2019s quick commerce business Blinkit, the market leader, . Analysts, however, worry that quick commerce\u2019s potential is limited to metro cities, which is likely to impact players in the long run. \u201cIn the next 2-3 years, penetration in the metro cities may witness a plateau,\u201d Karan Taurani, analyst at Elara Capital, told adding that rising competition in the segment will require firms to be capital-rich and invest sufficiently in expanding in non-metro cities as well as technological capabilities. The quick commerce rush has resulted in the influx of many players including Flipkart and Tata-owned BigBasket, leading to complaints from retail distributors about the viability of small mom-and-pop stores being undermined. int reported earlier this week that many owners believe their stores have been , resulting in a drop in order volume and footfall.

        "Article Content": "A century ago, Emily Post made manners popular. Her bestselling book, \u201cEtiquette\u201d (1922), framed the \u201cfundamentals of good behaviour\u201d as fashionable rather than fusty; she offered practical advice (\u201cwhen in doubt, wear the plainer dress\u201d) as well as dramatic warnings (a young lady \u201cunprotected by a chaperone\u201d is like \u201can unarmed traveller walking alone among wolves\u201d). Readers were gripped. Post received thousands of letters a week. In 1950 Pageant, a magazine, named her the second-most powerful woman in America. ( \u2014at that point the chair of the UN commission on human rights\u2014topped the list.) A century after Post\u2019s magnum opus, people are again saying \u201cyes please\u201d to politeness. A host of influencers offer etiquette lessons online, preaching on posture and teaching table manners. #Etiquette posts on TikTok have been viewed more than 5bn times. William Hanson, a British etiquette coach with some 5m fans on Instagram and TikTok, leads The English Manner, an \u201cetiquette and protocol institute\u201d. Sara Jane Ho, a Chinese instructor, has taken niceties to Netflix. \u201cMind Your Manners\u201d, a reality show, was nominated for an Emmy award in 2023. People are looking for help at the office as well as at home. Influencers cover topics such as how to start meetings (promptly) and advise on digital faux pas, including how to leave a group chat (quietly). More than half of American companies are enlisting experts to help employees hone their professional personas, according to a survey of bosses. The Institut Villa Pierrefeu\u2014which claims to be the only traditional finishing school in Europe that is still operating\u2014used to teach debutantes proper deportment. It now how to run a department. Old institutions are adapting to 21st-century norms. Courses at the Institut Villa Pierrefeu mix \u201cmodern conventions\u201d with \u201ctime-honoured traditions\u201d. , a guide to Britain\u2019s aristocracy, has updated its \u201cA-Z of Modern Manners\u201d to include behaviours such as \u201cmanspreading\u201d and \u201cghosting\u201d. Other books offer lessons in modern cordiality. Ms Ho recently published her etiquette teachings. Mr Hanson\u2019s guide to decorum will be published in September. This flurry of politesse comes at a time when most people think manners are in decline. Some 85% of Americans believe society is less civil than it was a decade ago, according to a recent survey; 90% of parents think youngsters aged between six and 18 are disrespectful. Most blame social media and peer pressure. As well as concerns about impertinence, interest in gentility has surged for two reasons. The first is covid, which stopped folk interacting face-to-face. People started worrying that their social skills were getting as much use as their formal wear. Mr Hanson says attendance at his in-person sessions increased by 60% after His clients tend to be between 25 and 45 years old, but those who came of age during covid are particularly self-conscious. Big consulting firms such as KPMG have introduced soft-skills training for pandemic-era graduates. The second reason is a confusion about what constitutes best practice in a global, digital age. There are guides online to everything from #emailetiquette to #selfieetiquette, #flyingetiquette to #airbnbetiquette. Following experts such as Ms Ho, who says her viewers \u201cknow what to do anywhere, with anyone, in any situation\u201d, can seem like a sure-fire way to avoid embarrassment. Finishing schools, which offer courses such as \u201cinternational etiquette\u201d and the \u201cEuropean art of dining\u201d, appeal to people who want to socialise or do business in foreign cultures. Like all customs, what is deemed genteel is subject to change. Post knew this, and criticised people who said because they followed less formal etiquette. Louise Mullaney, a sociolinguist, looks at cordial language in \u201cPolite\u201d, a new book. People have long seen linguistic shifts as a sign of crumbling civility, she notes, but they are a \u201cnatural and inevitable process of language evolution\u201d. An oft-cited example is the phrase \u201cif it please you\u201d, which was popular in Shakespeare\u2019s day. By the time Post published \u201cEtiquette\u201d it had been shortened to \u201cplease\u201d. now find it perfectly acceptable to type \u201cpls\u201d on mobile phones. Artificial intelligence (AI) will change politeness once more. McKinsey, a consultancy, reckons soft skills will become only more important for business leaders in an age when generative AI can do much of the analytical heavy lifting. Good manners may become more appreciated. At the same time, AI could also make people ruder. Parents worry that children who bark instructions at virtual assistants such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa are becoming terse. Google has tried to remedy this with its \u201cpretty please\u201d feature, which prompts children to say \u201cthe magic word\u201d. A growing field of research suggests polite prompts make AI models perform better. A new study by researchers in China, Japan and Britain found that rude requests cause to make things up and omit important bits of information. AI mirrors human receptiveness to social etiquette, the researchers think, because it is trained on massive amounts of data created by people. (Excessive flattery, too, prompts mistakes in chatbots.) In the digital world, as much as the physical one, it helps to mind your Ps and Qs.",

        "Article Content": "Leo Wurpillot was ten years old when he learned he had a brain tumour. To determine its malignancy, sections of the tumour had to be surgically removed and analysed. Now 19, he recalls the anguish that came with the subsequent three-month wait for a diagnosis. The news was good, and today Mr Wurpillot is a thriving first-year biomedical student at Cardiff University. But the months-long post-operative anticipation remains hard for patients to bear. That wait may one day be a thing of the past. On June 27th a group of brain surgeons, neuropathologists and computational biologists met at Queen\u2019s Medical Centre in Nottingham to hear about an ultrafast sequencing project developed by researchers at Nottingham University and the local hospital. Their work will allow brain tumours to be classified from tissue samples in two hours or less. As brain surgeries typically take many hours, this would allow results to come in before the end of surgery and inform the operation itself. Different tumours require different types of treatment. Some can be dealt with by radiation therapy or drugs alone, whereas others require surgery. But deciding how much of the tumour must be cut away in the delicate area of the brain, where removals can have lifelong consequences for the patients, is exceptionally tricky. And without knowing how dangerous the tumour is, surgeons cannot make the right judgments about how aggressive to be. To help them out, the Nottingham team is relying on a technology called nanopore sequencing. This sequences molecules of DNA or RNA by passing them through tiny holes engineered into a membrane. By measuring how an electric current running through those holes changes as different parts of the molecule pass through, the DNA can be read in real time. Nanopore sequencers can also speed up the analysis by doing something called adaptive sampling. This scans each DNA strand to see if it contains specific mutations that might be of interest. If none is found, the strand is ejected from the pores, leaving them open to sequence another strand. As data come out of the sequencing device it is processed by algorithms that classify the tumour as malignant or otherwise. Since March last year the team have analysed tumours from 90 patients. Thirty were retrospective samples to check their technique matched the answers given by conventional molecular and genomic classification methods. A further 60 were prospective samples taken during surgery. Across all 90 patients, the results matched those obtained by the old techniques in over 90% of cases, says Simon Paine, a consultant neuropathologist at Nottingham University and part of the project team. Stuart Smith, a consultant neurosurgeon at Nottingham University Hospitals Trust and another member of the team, has canvassed colleagues about the data they have previously been able to generate on patients\u2019 tumours. His results suggest the new technique would have changed the surgical strategies employed between 18% and 50% of the time. In some cases patients would have needed only one brain surgery rather than two. The approach is attracting interest. Dr Paine says that many of Britain\u2019s neurology centres have contacted them about the technique. They think it could eventually spread to the analysis of other types of tumour, including lymphomas and leukaemias, for which a battery of tests already exists. If ultrafast sequencing can be speeded up even further, drugs capable of effecting genetic changes in a brain tumour could one day be given during the operation itself. The team hopes they can get the test validated and approved for use as a diagnostic tool in the coming months. Neurosurgeons are not the first clinicians to discover the benefit of nanopore sequencing. A recent three-year study at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust used it to sequence the pathogens found on patients in intensive care, and found that 3% of patients were harbouring pathogens responsible for dangerous diseases such as Legionnaires\u2019 as well as nasty strains of MRSA. Bringing genetic sequencing to the medical front lines heralds a new era of diagnostic possibilities.",

        "Author Name": null,
        "Author URL": null,
        "Article Content": "China\u2019s paramount leader, Xi Jinping, contains multitudes. His economic philosophy touts both self-reliance and openness. His vision of policymaking embraces top-down design, but also bottom-up experimentation. During the covid-19 pandemic, he urged local officials to eliminate infections (which often required lockdowns) and promote growth (which required mobility). His recent call to cultivate \u201cnew productive forces\u201d entails championing cutting-edge technologies, but without neglecting traditional industries. Communists are taught to believe in the power of contradictory forces, as Trivium, a consultancy, once put it. So Mr Xi \u201cwill expect his comrades to cope\u201d. For others, Mr Xi\u2019s priorities can be baffling. Take the \u201ctwo unshakeables\u201d, one of his favourite slogans, which has been heard a lot in the past year or so. This refers to the Communist Party\u2019s unshakeable commitment to both the state-owned economy and private enterprise. The pledge, sometimes translated as the \u201ctwo unswervings\u201d or the \u201ctwo unwaverings\u201d, first appeared under Mr Xi\u2019s predecessors. It was reaffirmed in 2013 when his party promised to \u201cunwaveringly encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public sector\u201d. And it will no doubt feature at the forthcoming \u201cthird plenum\u201d, a twice-a-decade meeting devoted to long-term reforms, which will take place from July 15th-18th. But what does the formula mean? At first blush, each unshakeable seems to be in contradiction with the other. Almost 867,000 firms in China have some degree of state ownership, according to Franklin Allen of Imperial College London and co-authors. Real resources, unlike party slogans, are scarce. Any land, labour or capital used by China\u2019s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) ceases to be available to scrappier private firms. A commitment to one form of ownership must surely come at the expense of the other. Certainly, the fortunes of China\u2019s private firms have wavered. Their share of investment reached 59% in 2014, according to official figures. But that percentage has since dropped. At the end of last year, it was just 50%. Instead of support, China\u2019s private entrepreneurs have suffered fines, detentions and crackdowns. Three years ago, private firms accounted for 55% of the market value of China\u2019s top-100 listed firms, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think-tank. By the end of last year, that figure was 37%. But the two unshakeables are more compatible than they appear. Although private firms are more likely to thrive in the absence of SOEs, the reverse is not always true. Private competitors often make state-owned rivals better: more efficient and responsive to market demands. Since China\u2019s leaders cannot forswear state ownership, they want to make the most of what remains of it. They value private enterprise in part because the force of its example and the threat of private competition can help whip SOEs into shape. The private economy \u201chas not weakened the state-owned economy, but has improved the efficiency of state-owned enterprises and stimulated their vitality\u201d, argued Teng Tai, director of Wanbo New Economic Research Institute, a think-tank, at the launch of his new book on the private sector in Beijing. Private firms fear that SOEs will crowd them out: \u201cthe state advances, the private sector retreats,\u201d as the Chinese sometimes put it. But since the global financial crisis of 2007-09, the private sector has often retreated of its own accord, in response to market downturns, not state advances. In these cases, investment by state-owned vehicles, including local-government infrastructure firms, has filled the gap in demand left by a cowed private sector. Last month Yang Jing of the Institute of Marxism within the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences argued that SOEs provide \u201cballast\u201d and play the role of \u201cstabiliser\u201d. The labour, land and capital absorbed by such enterprises is not being denied to private firms if they were never going to use it. Private firms can benefit from SOE investment. Links between industries are \u201clike a giant spiders\u2019 web\u201d, points out Xiaohuan Lan of Fudan University. He cites BOE Technology Group, which evolved out of a state-owned maker of vacuum tubes. Its emergence as China\u2019s leading maker of digital displays helped break a foreign stranglehold to the benefit of downstream private enterprises making televisions and phones. The party\u2019s unshakeable commitment to private ownership is also of a peculiar kind. Elsewhere governments show support for private enterprise by getting out of the way. In China, by contrast, the party\u2019s commitment to the private sector includes a pledge to \u201cguide\u201d it. This can range from subsidies to regulatory restrictions. It can also work through party organisations within private firms that have grown in number and influence. In 2020 the party urged such organisations to direct members of private firms. \u201cArm their minds and guide their practice with Xi Jinping Thought\u201d, it said, and increase \u201ctheir political, ideological, and emotional identification with the Communist Party of China\u201d. Party officials have repeatedly said that private entrepreneurs are \u201cour own people\u201d. That may be reassuring to businessfolk who fear being vilified as greedy, unpatriotic or corrupt. But the gesture of solidarity is double-edged. It implies that entrepreneurs must mouth party platitudes and \u201cactively practise the core socialist values\u201d. Entrepreneurs cannot be their own people. In the early 2000s prominent businesspeople joined the party hoping it would be a vehicle for their commercial ambitions. But it has become increasingly clear that the party sees private firms as a vehicle for its own objectives. Officials are not indifferent to private enterprise. The party\u2019s unshakeable commitment to the sector is sincere\u2014even if many entrepreneurs may wish it were less so.",

        "Title": "Does Britain need a National Wealth Fund?",
        "Author Name": null,
        "Author URL": null,
        "Article Content": "On July 9th Britain\u2019s new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, confirmed plans to set up a \u00a37.3bn ($9.4bn) National Wealth Fund (NWF). The details, including its personnel, risk tolerance and degree of independence, are yet to be ironed out. But in its outlines, the plan brings to mind the old clich\u00e9 about the Holy Roman Empire\u2014that it was none of those three things. Despite its name, the NWF is not intended to be a sovereign-wealth fund, an open-ended pot of government-run investments along the lines of Singapore\u2019s GIC or Australia\u2019s Future Fund. Instead, Ms Reeves wants the NWF to be a development-bank-cum-investment-concierge. Focused narrowly on a handful of favoured green industries like steel, hydrogen and batteries, it will aim to \u201ccrowd in\u201d three times as much private capital by biting off the riskiest chunk of projects. That vision makes it closer in spirit to the UK Infrastructure Bank (UKIB), a Boris Johnson-era green lending venture. Britain has a long lineage of state-backed efforts to pull cash into voguish industries. Some are still running, like UKIB or the British Business Bank, a lender to startups that dates back to the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition of 2010-15. (Ms Reeves intends to eventually pull both under the NWF umbrella.) Others are now defunct. The UK Green Investment Bank, another coalition-era lender, lost favour and was sold off in 2017 to Macquarie Group, an Australian investment conglomerate. Further back, the NWF has some similarities to the 1970s National Enterprise Board, a vehicle that propped up Britain\u2019s ailing manufacturing sector during Harold Wilson\u2019s premiership. The chances of the NWF substantially greening and expanding the British economy do not seem much greater than those of its predecessors. Labour is right to note that Britain has a serious problem with under-investment. But access to finance is not the main bottleneck. Only 5% of the manufacturers surveyed by the Confederation of British Industry, a lobby group, said that trouble raising money is holding them back from investing. Half pointed to uncertainty about demand and a third to worries about inadequate returns (see chart). Thoughtfully structured investment (for instance a \u201ccap and floor\u201d mechanism, in which the NWF would stabilise revenue by topping it up below a certain band in return for payouts above that band) could allay some of those issues. But in most cases, they are best mitigated by a growing and stable economy.Besides, \u201cwe have a very well-developed financial system with lots of risk finance,\u201d says Neil Lee of the London School of Economics. \u201cIf people aren\u2019t investing, it\u2019s probably not because there aren\u2019t enough clever bankers in London.\u201d More plausible culprits for low investment are Britain\u2019s blocker-friendly planning system, its recent reputation for chaotic governance and a lack of expertise on managing big projects, especially in local government. Since taking charge, Labour has said it will offer more policy stability and launched an initial salvo of pro-development regulatory changes. These are much more likely to alter Britain\u2019s growth prospects for the better. Another worry is the NWF\u2019s narrow scope. Emphasising green manufacturing lines up neatly with the Labour Party\u2019s ideological proclivities. (Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, plans to launch a related venture, GB Energy, that focuses on renewable-power generation.) Less clear is whether that focus matches what the British economy needs to grow. Services, which make up 80% of output and more than half of exports, are largely absent from the NWF\u2019s mandate. The single largest slug of NWF financing will be directed towards steel, an industry where Britain\u2019s high energy costs and stringent environmental standards make competitiveness a challenge. But the most serious question is more fundamental: should the British state be selectively doling out capital on generous terms at all? Governments across the rich world have gone on a green splurge over the past few years; a report on the NWF prepared for Labour by a task-force of finance-sector bigwigs points out that very similar bodies are already operating in Canada and Australia. Boosters say Britain could be left behind. They also emphasise that new green technologies are inherently risky. In theory, having the NWF shave off a portion of the downside risk (in return for appropriate upside) could entice larger, more cautious pools of capital like pension funds to invest alongside. But Britain\u2019s fraught history with industrial subsidies, especially in the post-war years, is not promising. And using the NWF to barge in on a global subsidies race would be an expensive error. The NWF and associated ventures are dwarfed by the trillion-dollar scale of American green spending, for example, though they are closer in size to Canadian and Australian efforts. Probably the strongest argument for state involvement is also the most dispiriting. A history of planning vetoes and costly U-turns on totemic projects like HS2, a rail line, has left many foreign investors leery of Britain; a government co-investor with taxpayer cash on the line might provide some reassurance of its commitment to specific policies and projects.",

        "Article Content": "Politics in Japan can be a staid affair. The race to become the governor of Tokyo, which reached its climax on July 7th, was anything but that. Fifty-six candidates, many of them eccentrics, traded barbs. Pets featured on election posters; so, in one case, did pornography. A candidate dressed as the Joker from \u201cBatman\u201d spouted nonsense on national television. Another took off her clothes. In the end Koike Yuriko, the incumbent governor, bagged herself a third term with some 43% of votes. Yet it was the second-place finisher\u2014Ishimaru Shinji, an outspoken but little-known former banker\u2014who stole the headlines. Up to now, Japanese voters have seemed curiously unmoved by the kinds of social-media-fuelled populism that have upturned politics in other countries. That no longer seems so true. Most people expected that the race would be a head-to-head between Ms Koike, a former national legislator for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Saito Renho from the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), the main liberal opposition (who goes by just her given name). Both Ms Koike and Renho gained fame as television newsreaders before they entered politics. Yet relative obscurity was no obstacle for Mr Ishimaru. His brief political career\u2014four years as mayor of Akitakata, an unremarkable town in Hiroshima\u2014did not produce any noteworthy achievements. His candidacy was not backed by any political party. Instead, the 41-year-old used social media, especially YouTube and TikTok, to convey his messages. On YouTube Mr Ishimaru broadcast to around 300,000 subscribers, compared with 3,000 for Ms Koike and 10,000 for Renho. A video that showed him berating a snoozing council member in Akitakata went viral. He promised to clear out power-hungry politicians and mocked journalists from mainstream media. In a post-election appearance he accused an interviewer of asking \u201cstupid\u201d questions while a crowd of supporters cheered. Mr Ishimaru \u201cmastered an important social-media skill\u201d, says Michael Cucek of Temple University in Tokyo. He appeared to \u201cspeak the truth to power when in fact just spouting negative nonsense\u201d. For years voters in Japan have seemed to be mired in apathy. The LDP has dominated politics for a decade. Turnout at elections has declined. But Mr Ishimaru\u2019s strong showing suggests both that there is appetite for change, and that social media can indeed provide a path for outsiders. According to one exit poll he snatched 42% of the votes of people aged 18-29, compared with 27% for Ms Koike and 15% for Renho. \u201cMost politicians say they care about young people, but I don\u2019t think they mean it,\u201d says Kiyono Misato, a 28-year-old who voted for Mr Ishimaru. She thought Mr Ishimaru \u201cwould be different\u201d. Japanese voters are \u201cfed up with existing politics\u201d and feel \u201cgrowing mistrust\u201d, reckons Uchiyama Yu, a political scientist at the University of Tokyo. Social-media rabble-rousers such as Mr Ishimaru will find it more difficult to make a dent in national elections than in local ones. They find it much harder to impress older, rural voters than young ones in cities. But that will not stop them from trying. After the election, Mr Ishimaru told journalists he may contest the seat in parliament that is currently held by Kishida Fumio, Japan\u2019s unpopular prime minister. Ms Koike\u2019s victory, at least, is a relief for the LDP. But by-elections for the Tokyo assembly were held the same day as the vote for governor, and in those the LDP won just two seats out of nine. \u201cThe results are very severe,\u201d says Mutai Shunsuke, an LDP politician in the national parliament. Mr Kishida\u2019s approval rating may be as low as 16%, according to polling by Jiji, a newswire. Rivals are preparing to challenge his leadership at a party vote due in September.",

        "Article Content": "Tuesday\u2019s debate between Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump attracted an audience of 57.7 million US viewers on eight major TV networks \u2014 beating the turnout for President Joe Biden\u2019s ill-fated performance in June. The contest was viewed as a crucial test for both candidates. Vice President Harris targeted the former president for his felony convictions, his wealth and his role in overturning the federal right to an abortion. Trump complained that fact-checking of his remarks by the moderators from ABC amounted to a rigged debate. The results ran \u201ccontrary to expectations of voter fatigue and anemic viewership,\u201d Ashwin Navin, chief executive officer of data researcher Samba TV, said in an email. The debate contrasted with the earlier face-off more than two months ago, when Biden\u2019s mental stumbles raised questions about his fitness to serve a second term. Harris, who took over as nominee, made no comparable blunders. Trump, trying to make the Biden-Harris immigration policy a key point of his campaign, repeated unfounded, online claims that undocumented migrants in an Ohio suburb were eating people\u2019s pets. Last night\u2019s program was moderated by ABC News\u2019 David Muir and Linsey Davis. The preliminary ratings were released by Fox, which drew 13.7 million viewers over cable and broadcast. The host network ABC, part of Walt Disney Co., attracted 18.3 million viewers, leading all others even though the company\u2019s audience may have been limited by a dispute with DirecTV. That service\u2019s subscribers could still watch on other networks. The June debate between Trump and Biden drew an audience of 51.3 million viewers. The most-watched debate ever was the first between Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016, drawing an audience of 84 million.",

        "Article Content": "Throughout Tuesday night\u2019s hour and 45-minute debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump perpetuated a number of lies and half-truths about his record on health care \u2014 and seemed unable to offer Americans a concrete vision for how he would secure a healthier future for the country, instead referring only to \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d The most egregious falsehood came when Trump was backed into a corner on his flip-flopping position on abortion. He leaned into a fiction he has repeated throughout his campaign: that Democrats want to allow \u201cpost-birth abortions.\u201d During the debate, he even claimed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Harris\u2019 running mate, \u201csays abortion in the ninth month is absolutely fine. He also says execution after birth, it\u2019s execution, no longer abortion, because the baby is born, is OK.\u201d Hopefully most rational voters understand what moderator Linsey Davis noted after Trump\u2019s tirade: \u201cThere is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it\u2019s born.\u201d Trump\u2019s lies about post-birth abortions are especially cruel because, as best I can understand, he is deliberately taking out of context tragic circumstances where a baby is delivered and is too sick to survive \u2014 and parents must make the heartbreaking decision to pursue palliative care. And by ending the protections of Roe v. Wade, the justices appointed to the Supreme Court by Trump have ensured that more families must confront those choices. In the year after the court allowed Texas\u2019 abortion ban to stand, infant deaths rose by roughly 13%, or 255 babies. That included a nearly 23% rise in deaths due to congenital anomalies. That means some women were likely forced to carry a child to term that they knew was going to die after birth. Trump also slammed \u201clate-term\u201d abortions. But in the exceedingly rare case that someone is undergoing an abortion later in a pregnancy, it\u2019s typically because the baby or mother are not going to survive if the pregnancy continues. Yet Trump falsely portrayed these cases as situations in which a woman in the \u201ceighth month, ninth month, seventh month\u201d of pregnancy cavalierly decides to end a healthy pregnancy. That\u2019s a twisted fantasy of the far-right. When there\u2019s a medical emergency late in a pregnancy, as one fetal maternal medicine specialist told me plainly, \u201cif the fetus is viable, we\u2019re going to deliver it.\u201d Another glaring health care falsehood perpetuated by Trump last night was the notion that he had somehow helped to improve the Affordable Care Act. Although he had run on the premise that he would do away with Obamacare, Trump claimed that when faced with the choice to \u201csave it and make it as good as it can be\u201d or to \u201clet it rot,\u201d he \u201cdid the right thing.\u201d In reality, Trump made a number of calculated moves to undermine the ACA, like cutting the subsidies that helped lure insurers into the marketplace. He also made it harder for people to access public insurance options by cutting funding to advertise enrollments, shortening the enrollment window, and slashing by 80% funding to the navigator program, which helps people choose the right plan. As a consequence, ACA enrollments, which had been rising under the Obama administration as the marketplace gained momentum, fell throughout Trump\u2019s presidency. When President Joe Biden took office, he restored funding to those programs and opened a special enrollment period to offer another chance to people who had missed out under Trump, while also expanding subsidies and introducing tax credits that made care more affordable. That strategy worked and ACA signups began to climb, with the percentage of uninsured Americans eventually hitting an all-time low in 2023. The question before voters now is how Trump will approach health care if he wins another term. While he continues to take jabs at the ACA and float the idea that he would entertain alternatives if they were better and cheaper, he hasn\u2019t offered anything concrete. Trump also claimed that his administration \u201cdid a phenomenal job with the pandemic,\u201d despite ample evidence that he impeded public health experts\u2019 ability to effectively respond to the crisis. That included undermining the value of masks \u2014 a stance that epidemiologists believe cost lives, as well as\u00a0attempting to slow down the rollout of testing\u00a0and promoting unproven and even dangerous therapies. And one analysis found that his health care policies leading into Covid\u2019s arrival exacerbated the death toll during the first year of the pandemic. Trump curiously did not mention the one area of the pandemic where he unambiguously succeeded: Operation Warp Speed. It yielded vaccines and treatments with breathtaking speed, and ultimately saved millions of lives. Yet with deep pockets of his base fixated on the imaginary dangers of these shots, Trump seems reluctant to remind voters of that amazing scientific achievement. Trump\u2019s omissions and fabrications on health care may have been overshadowed by a more meme-able moment: Trump\u2019s bizarre quip that Harris \u201cwants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison.\u201d This struck many viewers as a Mad Libs-style riff on Trump\u2019s favorite divisive issues \u2014 transgender medicine, crime and immigration. It\u2019s hard to tell, but the word salad may have been a misleading nod to Harris\u2019 response to a 2019 candidate questionnaire provided by the American Civil Liberties Union, which asked about providing comprehensive health care to transgender people who rely on the state for medical care. That moment \u2014 like \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d\u2014 will likely stick with many voters as a memorable example of the way Trump slid off the rails on Tuesday. But what will stick with me is the cruelty behind all of Trump\u2019s health care lies. More From Bloomberg Opinion: For more, subscribe to our newsletter.

        "Article Content": "By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed, Suzanne McGee and Rae Wee NEW YORK, Sept 11 - Investors scrambled to shift their positioning on Wednesday following a closely-watched debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, as betting markets swung in Harris\u2019 favor after the event. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that owns Truth Social, fell 13% on Wednesday afternoon, while other so-called Trump trades such as bitcoin and crypto stocks retreated. Solar stocks, seen as benefiting from a Harris win, rallied and healthcare shares fell. In a combative debate late Tuesday, Trump and Harris clashed over everything from the economy to immigration, as each sought a campaign-altering moment in what has been a closely-fought race. Their exchanges left investors with few new details on issues that could sway markets, including tariffs, taxes and regulation. But online prediction markets showed bets on a stronger likelihood of a Harris win in November: Harris\u2019 odds in PredictIt\u2019s 2024 presidential general election market improved to 55 cents from 53 cents before the debate, while Trump\u2019s odds slipped to 47 cents from 52 cents. There is a \u201cgeneral view that Harris won the debate,\u201d said Alvin Tan, head of Asia FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore. \u201cIt's obviously not a slam dunk for Harris, but the chances of a Trump victory have slipped a bit.\" While the presidential race is very much on investors\u2019 minds, political concerns have lately coalesced with more immediate market catalysts, including worries over a potentially softening U.S. economy and uncertainty over how deeply the Fed will need to cut interest rates. The S&P 500 notched its worst weekly percentage loss since March 2023 last week after a second-straight underwhelming jobs report, though the index is still up around 15% this year. Still, some investors believe even a small shift in perceptions of the candidates could prove significant in a contest that could come down to tens of thousands of votes in a handful of states. The candidates are effectively tied in the seven battleground states likely to decide the election, according to polling averages compiled by the New York Times. \"The US Presidential debate achieved its goal by providing a decisive edge to one of the candidates in what has been an exceptionally close race,\" said Charu Chanana, Head of FX Strategy and Global Market Strategist at Saxo. \"Crypto and energy stocks might face headwinds as market sentiment adjusts to the shifting political dynamics.\" Trump has positioned himself as a pro-cryptocurrency candidate. While it was hard to separate election-fueled moves from macroeconomic-driven action in the dollar, rates and stocks following Wednesday's highly-awaited report on U.S. consumer prices, investors pointed to several corners of the market where the debate appeared to have made an impact. Investors hammered the shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, which have been popular among retail traders and sensitive to the former president's chances of a win in the 2024 election. The stock fell by as much as 18% to a new post-IPO low of $15.30. Bitcoin was about flat on the day after slipping nearly 4%, while shares of some cryptocurrency-focused companies including crypto miner Riot Platforms also fell. Stock of operators of correctional facilities, including GEO Group and CoreCivic, viewed as likely to benefit from tougher immigration policies, also slipped. At the same time, U.S.-listed shares of solar companies, seen as benefiting from a Harris win, rose. The Invesco Solar ETF, down about 25% for the year, jumped 5% on Wednesday. Health insurer stocks including Humana and CVS Health were also down on Wednesday. Some analysts believe Harris' push to lower drug prices may weigh on the sector. TAXES AND TARIFFS Trump has promised lower corporate taxes and a tougher stance on trade and tariffs. He has also said a strong dollar hurts the U.S., though some analysts believe his policies could spur inflation and eventually buoy the currency. Harris last month outlined plans to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, a proposal that some on Wall Street believe could hurt corporate profits. Steve Chiavarone, senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes, said a Harris presidency, seen as less likely to widen budget deficits through higher spending, could help support Treasury prices while also boosting large-cap growth and tech stocks. US-focused policies such as tax cuts and tariffs in a Trump presidency could buoy small cap stocks and cyclical companies while hurting bonds, he said. On Tuesday night, Harris attacked Trump's intention to impose high tariffs on foreign goods - a proposal she has likened to a sales tax on the middle class - while touting her plan to offer tax benefits to families and small businesses. The Chinese yuan, which had come under pressure in the U.S.-China trade war during Trump's term, edged up against the dollar on Wednesday. Trump criticized Harris for the persistent inflation during the Biden administration's term. However, economic policies could be up in the air for a while longer. \"There wasn\u2019t much substantive discussion of policy,\" said Sonu Varghese, global macro strategist at Carson Group. \"Neither candidate advocated for vastly different economic policies than currently in place. Ultimately, a lot of economic policies that we see implemented next year will depend on the makeup of the Senate and the House.\"",

        "Article Content": "Oil climbed the most in two weeks as Hurricane Francine ripped through key oil-producing zones in the US Gulf of Mexico, prompting traders to cover bearish bets. West Texas Intermediate rose more than 2% to settle above $67 a barrel, erasing most of the previous day\u2019s plunge. Global benchmark Brent crude advanced to top $70 a barrel. The gain was fueld by short-covering after the storm prompted oil companies to shut in roughly 25% of Gulf crude output, said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president for trading at BOK Financial Securities. Exxon Mobil Corp., Shell Plc and other offshore drillers evacuated crews and suspended operations on platforms threatened by the hurricane\u2019s lashing waves and high winds. \u201cWhile global demand has weakened, current US supplies could tighten further if Hurricane Francine causes multiple days of well shut-ins,\u201d Kissler said. The storm overshadowed a bearish US government tally that showed a surprise 833,000-barrel increase in domestic crude stockpiles. An industry group had projected a 2.79-million barrel decline, and Bloomberg users were expecting a 700,000-barrel drop. Crude has sunk by almost one-fifth this quarter on concerns that slowing growth in the US and China, the leading consumers, is hurting energy demand amid robust oil supplies. Market metrics \u2014 including the shape of the futures curve \u2014 indicate that conditions are quickly becoming far less tight, with pockets further out making a brief foray into a bearish contango structure. Speculators, led by heavy selling from CTAs, had taken up the least bullish stance on record coming into this week, and traders have warned about the potential for price spikes as money managers unwind some of the bearish bets. Meanwhile, Francine\u2019s winds are raking the coast of Louisiana, where it is expected to make landfall later Wednesday. In addition to offshore well shutdowns, as many as eight onshore refineries lie in the system\u2019s potential path. Oil\u2019s recent retreat had already seen OPEC postpone an output hike, stoking investor concerns that the extra barrels could be still be brought to the market closer to 2025. The International Energy Agency \u2014 which will issue a revised monthly outlook later this week \u2014 said in August the market risked higher inventories next year even if the cartel canceled the output increase. \u201cWe\u2019ve got closer to what looks like a high-conviction surplus for next year,\u201d Citigroup Inc. head of commodities research Max Layton said in an interview with Bloomberg television. \u201cThe market has just simply got closer to D-Day really.\u201d To get Bloomberg\u2019s Energy Daily newsletter into your inbox, click here.

        "Article Content": "The US and the UK signaled they were open to Ukraine\u2019s request to use western-provided weapons to strike deeper into Russia despite concerns that doing so could further escalate a conflict now in its third year. During a visit to Kyiv on Wednesday, the two countries\u2019 top diplomats didn\u2019t rule out agreeing to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s request but said President Joe Biden would discuss the matter more when he meets Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Washington later this week. That has dovetailed with a push by some of Ukraine\u2019s allies to allow neighboring NATO members to shoot down Russian missiles and drones inside Ukrainian airspace before they enter their own, according to people familiar with the matter. The US until now has opposed using US-provided weapons to hit targets deeper in Russia, citing concerns that doing so might only deepen the conflict. But Washington and London have changed their tone in the days since they accused Iran of sending a shipment of ballistic missiles to Russia. That move was \u201ca significant and dangerous escalation,\u201d UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said at a press conference in Kyiv. \u201cI\u2019m going take this discussion back to Washington to brief the president on what I heard,\u201d Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the same briefing. \u201cWe have adjusted and adapted as needs have changed, as the battlefield has changed and I have no doubt we\u2019ll continue to do that.\u201d The joint visit by Blinken and Lammy was meant to hear Zelenskiy\u2019s plan to striking deeper into Russian territory and discuss his longer-term strategy into next year. That included wanting to get a better sense of what Kyiv wants to target and why. The meeting between Blinken, Lammy and Zelenskiy went longer than planned and the Ukrainian president explained in detail why Ukraine needs to strike inside Russia, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. The person said Zelenskiy told them Ukraine is only interested in military targets and discussed his country\u2019s plans for the coming months. Ahead of the meeting with Blinken and Lammy, the Ukrainian president said he would reinforce his plea to soften weapons restrictions in a meeting with Biden later this month in New York, where world leaders will gather for the UN General Assembly\u2019s annual high-level debate. \u201cUnfortunately it doesn\u2019t depend on my optimism, it depends on their optimism,\u201d Zelenskiy told reporters Wednesday. A decision on deep strikes is unlikely to come before the UN meeting in New York, although Biden may weigh in on whether a policy shift is coming. Lammy confirmed that, saying the UN meeting would be the next opportunity to discuss long-range missiles and further support for Ukraine. The UK has indicated it\u2019s open to Ukraine striking military targets inside Russia with Britain\u2019s Storm Shadow missiles. Late last month, Zelenskiy said he would lay out a \u201cvictory plan\u201d to force Russia to halt its invasion when he meets with Biden, though didn\u2019t offer specifics. He said he would also brief the US presidential candidates, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, on the plan. The question took on new urgency for Ukraine after Tuesday night\u2019s debate between Harris and Trump. The Republican nominee twice declined to say if he wants Ukraine to win the war against Russia, saying instead he wants \u201cthe war to stop.\u201d He reiterated his claim that, if elected, he\u2019d resolve the war before taking office. Ukraine\u2019s new foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, deflected a question about Trump\u2019s remarks at the briefing with Lammy and Blinken. \u201cWe believe in and are fully convinced of the full support of the American people,\u201d he said. On Tuesday, the US and the UK accused Iran of shipping its Fath-360 missiles to Russia despite months of warnings not to do so. The transfer represents a deepening involvement by Tehran in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and marks a \u201ccritical moment\u201d in the war, Blinken said. And while Blinken indicated he\u2019s more amenable to a policy change, others in the Biden administration, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, have expressed reluctance. During a meeting with defense chiefs last week at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, Austin told reporters that no specific weapon would be a game changer in Russia\u2019s war. The Biden administration is facing pressure from some NATO allies to take a more aggressive stance. Sybiha has discussed the idea of NATO shooting down Russian missiles, according to the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the talks are private. The people said there\u2019s no consensus within NATO and a policy change isn\u2019t imminent. One official said nations on NATO\u2019s eastern flank could take action in Ukrainian airspace without a broader agreement. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski told the Financial Times last week that Warsaw and others have a \u201cduty\u201d to intercept incoming Russian missiles, although that sentiment isn\u2019t universally shared within his coalition government. Outgoing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg previously rejected such a proposal, saying it risked the alliance \u201cbecoming part of the conflict.\u201d With assistance from Aliaksandr Kudrytski and Olesia Safronova.",

The yen gained after a Bank of Japan official signaled more interest rate increases. The European stocks benchmark added 0.4%, while Asian equities slid and futures in the US stocks slipped 0.3%. Worries over slowing growth in major economies have resurfaced with oil trading below $70 and global bond yields retreatuing to a two-year low this week. Investors\u2019 attention is on the US consumer price index due later Wednesday \u2014 expected to show another month of muted increases \u2014 and the Fed policy meeting next week. \u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty ahead of next week\u2019s expected rate cut,\u201d said Kieran Calder, head of equity research for Asia at Union Bancaire Privee in Singapore. The debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump was also in focus, though market responses were limited. Harris\u2019 odds of winning the election increased on the betting website PredictIt to 56%, compared with 53% before the debate. Trump\u2019s support of the crypto sector saw Bitcoin slip. Traders in the US interest-rate options market are still betting on at least one 50 basis-point Fed rate cut this year \u2014 just probably not before the Nov. 5 election. \u201cDownside volatility\u201d is possible if Wednesday\u2019s inflation print comes in hot, given the market\u2019s expectations for aggressive cuts, said Sameer Samana at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cA cooler print has more two-way risk as it creates more room for the Fed to cut, but may also indicate the economy is slowing faster than anticipated.\u201d Yen Strength Separately, the yen advanced to its strongest level against the greenback since December, wiping out its losses for the year, after BOJ policy member Junko Nakagawa said the central bank will continue to adjust the degree of easing. Most economists surveyed expected the central bank to wait until December or January before raising rates again, with the next decision scheduled for next week. Nakagawa\u2019s remarks \u201cmake markets think the BOJ may hike rates earlier and faster, possibly this year,\u201d pushing up the yen, said Shoki Omori, chief desk strategist at Mizuho Securities Co.

        "Article Content": "Nippon Steel Corp. is mounting a last-ditch push to muster support for its $14.1 billion takeover of United States Steel Corp., a deal opposed by President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and ex-President Donald Trump. Biden and Harris want the company to remain domestically owned while Trump has flatly said he\u2019d block it. The United Steelworkers union leadership also opposes the deal. But, among other stakeholders and some union members, the view is more mixed \u2014 with some supporting the deal because they worry that another buyer won\u2019t match Nippon Steel\u2019s pledges to invest $2.7 billion into some mills. Nippon Steel Executive Vice President Takahiro Mori traveled to Washington for meetings Wednesday. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States must review the deal and send a recommendation to Biden\u2019s desk. As of Wednesday, it had yet to do so, according to a US official who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations. People familiar with the matter said earlier this month that Biden planned to kill the sale once it reaches his desk. US Steel rose as much as 8.7% to as high as $33.92 a share as of 3:45 p.m. in New York, the biggest intraday increase since Dec. 18. Some union members and political figures are expressing support for a deal that otherwise faces staunch opposition from union brass and the highest echelons of American politics. Many of the rank and file at a trio of plants near Pittsburgh want the deal to go through, Jason Zugai, vice president of United Steelworkers Local 2227, said in an interview. He represents workers at one of three plants in Pennsylvania\u2019s Mon Valley that could benefit as Nippon Steel has pledged to invest at least $1 billion there. \u201cThe deal on the table would solidify the jobs in the Mon Valley for the next 50 to 100 years,\u201d Zugai said. Earlier: US Steel Assets Face Chopping Block Without Japan Deal While some local members favor the offer, the overarching United Steelworkers union opposes the deal. \u201cThe bottom line about this merger is that it jeopardizes national security and critical supply chains,\u201d United Steel Workers President Dave McCall said in a statement, insisting that Nippon\u2019s commitments come with \u201cso many conditions as to make their promises worthless.\u201d \u201cNow USS and Nippon are politicizing the situation in a last-ditch attempt to save the deal,\u201d he said. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who has neither backed nor opposed the deal, publicly, is acting as something of a mediator behind the scenes. Shapiro\u2019s office said earlier this month he was working \u201cwith all parties to find a solution that protects Pennsylvania jobs.\u201d The White House and Shapiro\u2019s office declined to comment. In his communication with the administration, Shapiro has not expressed opposition to blocking the sale and has said he supports the steelworkers, according to a person familiar with the matter who also asked not to be identified to discuss the talks. US Steel has threatened to shutter plants and move its headquarters out of Pennsylvania if the acquisition collapses. But McCall has steadfastly opposed the deal, saying Nippon Steel is refusing to put its parent company\u2019s name on the agreement or offer sufficient guarantees to the union. \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019ll still be people around interested in US Steel,\u201d he said in an interview last week. The company has rebutted that. \u201cThere is no scenario where US Steel would make these investments \u2013 absent Nippon Steel. A transaction with Nippon Steel is the best avenue to ensure that US Steel will be able to thrive well into the future,\u201d US Steel said in a statement. US Steel and Nippon Steel took the extraordinary step Wednesday of publishing their private correspondence with the union, saying they want to fight \u201cpublic mischaracterizations of our communications with the USW.\u201d Mori, in a Sept. 3 letter to McCall, said: \u201cPersonally, I remain convinced that, if you and I can partner together, we can achieve amazing results for US Steel and the USW\u2019s membership.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re confident that Nippon Steel\u2019s acquisition of U. S. Steel will benefit American workers, local communities, and national security in a way no other alternative can,\u201d Nippon Steel said in a statement. US-based Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. has expressed interest in buying some or all of US Steel, but was outbid by Nippon Steel. The company\u2019s chief executive officer has said the company might still be interested. Pennsylvania\u2019s two senators, Bob Casey, who\u2019s running for re-election, and John Fetterman, also oppose the deal. Earlier: Japan PM Contender Hayashi Holds Out Hope for Nippon Steel Deal Pennsylvania, home to both US Steel and the union, is a key battleground state and the issue has become entwined in the US presidential election. But neither Harris nor Trump raised the deal in their debate Tuesday, held in Pennsylvania. Biden and Harris have both said US Steel should remain American owned and operated \u2014 \u201cguaranteed,\u201d Biden once said. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has vowed to kill the sale, and his running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, is a longtime opponent of the deal. Yoshimasa Hayashi, Japan\u2019s top government spokesman and a candidate for the ruling party\u2019s leadership, said in an interview with Bloomberg last week, after reports that Biden was poised to block the deal, that he\u2019s holding out hope the sale can proceed. \u201cIt\u2019s still going on and we don\u2019t know the result yet,\u201d Hayashi said. In Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh and several US Steel facilities, county council member Sam DeMarco is in favor of the deal. As many as 7,500 jobs directly and indirectly rely on the operations of US Steel in the Pittsburgh area, DeMarco said. \u201cSo many of the folks that are in the rank and file, what they\u2019re concerned with is that they have a job in the future and the ability to put food on the family\u2019s table and a roof over the family\u2019s head,\u201d DeMarco said. At the Irvin plant, Justin Calderone, a shift manager and a former USW member, supports the deal. \u201cI have not had many run-ins with people who are just like \u2018we can\u2019t be sold this and that,\u2019\u201d Calderone said. \u201cI would say 90% of the people here believe that the Nippon purchase is what\u2019s best for our facility.\u201d Pennsylvania State Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward, a Republican, supports the sale. \u201cMy message to either party is take a look at the concessions that have been given. Take a look at the promised investment,\u201d she said in an interview, referring to Biden\u2019s decision. \u201cIt would a devastating thing if Biden kills this then, four to five years after, US Steel says \u2018we\u2019re leaving.\u2019\u201d",

        "Article Content": "Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on Germany\u2019s energy policy during Tuesday\u2019s debate drew umbrage \u2014 and a sharp social media jab \u2014 from the country\u2019s foreign ministry, underscoring the extent to which the Republican presidential nominee retains a raw diplomatic relationship with some of Europe\u2019s leading powers. The squabble originated in the closing moments of Trump\u2019s face-to-face showdown with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, whom the former president was eager to cast as an opponent of fracking and fossil fuels and in favor of renewable energy. The issue has become a flashpoint in Pennsylvania, the key swing state where the debate was held and where a fracking boom has boosted the economy. \u201cGermany tried that, and within one year they were back to building normal energy plants,\u201d Trump said Tuesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re not ready for it. We can\u2019t sacrifice our country for the sake of bad vision.\u201d Germany\u2019s foreign ministry bridled at the swipe, saying in a social media post, \u201cLike it or not: Germany\u2019s energy system is fully operational, with more than 50% renewables. And we are shutting down \u2013 not building \u2013 coal & nuclear plants. Coal will be off the grid by 2038 at the latest.\u201d \u201cPS: We also don\u2019t eat cats and dogs,\u201d the post added. The quip \u2014 a reference to Trump\u2019s airing during the debate of an unfounded conspiracy theory that migrants in Ohio were eating neighborhood pets \u2014 was a break from normally staid diplomatic statements, particularly among allies who often seek to avoid taking sides in domestic campaigns. The episode also underscored the extent to which energy policy might remain a sore spot for Germany, which decided to close the nation\u2019s nuclear reactors after the 2011 disaster at Japan\u2019s Fukushima plant. The decision meant that Germany had to burn more environmentally-damaging coal to make up for lost energy production \u2014 particularly after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine led to a surge in the cost of natural gas. Berlin has dropped an initial goal to phase out coal by the end of the decade. Still, the country has not undertaken the type of reversal described by Trump. The use of coal power has dropped significantly in recent years and the country does not have plans to construct any new coal-fired plants. Trump frequently clashed with then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel during his presidency, and in particular his push to condition US military protection on allies reaching the goal of spending at least 2% of gross domestic product on defense. Current German leader Olaf Scholz praised Harris earlier this year as a \u201ccompetent and experienced politician.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "By Karen Braun NERVILLE, Illinois, Sept 11 - Fresh government estimates for the U.S. corn and soybean crops are notorious for jolting the grain market and sometimes changing overall sentiment. That is not the most probable outcome on Thursday as crop pegs are already very large, but corn may have an easier path to potential supply excitement versus soybeans given the recent fundamentals. On average, analysts expect the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday will peg U.S. corn yield at 182.4 bushels per acre, down from 183.1 in August and well ahead of last year\u2019s record of 177.3 bpa. That would be an unusually light change from the August yield, as an adjustment closer to 2 bpa has been seen in the past few Septembers, on average. But the trade rarely suffers a complete miss on the September corn yield, which fell outside the range of guesses just twice in the last two decades. However, analysts are working with a tight margin for error as their corn yield guesses span just 3 bpa, the narrowest for this report in at least two decades. The highest estimate of 183.5 bpa is very close to USDA\u2019s August yield, and this is an area to watch for a possible surprise. U.S. soybean yield is seen unchanged from August at 53.2 bpa. In the last few years, September soy yield varied by about 1 bpa versus August, on average. Analysts have left wiggle room with soy yield given the 2.9-bpa range of estimates, well above average. The top guess of 54.9 offers extra coverage on the high side. It is interesting to note that USDA\u2019s September corn yield has not come in below the average trade guess since 2015. USDA\u2019s soy yields were also above the trade averages in every September from 2013 through 2021, but they were below expectations in the last two years. PRODUCTION FOCUS The trade\u2019s corn and soy yield expectations for Thursday are higher than its pre-August report predictions, suggesting increasing comfort in the huge targets. Recent weather could be an obstacle, however, as last month was the Midwest\u2019s driest August since 2013 and much of the area has remained very dry so far this month. The crops avoided excessive heat this summer, but both this week and next week will feature temperatures well above normal. This could prevent some of the later-planted corn ears from filling kernels to their full potential, possibly shaving yields. USDA last month revised planted and harvested corn and soybean areas, so acreage-driven production surprises might be less likely this month. However, USDA last month unexpectedly increased soybean plantings by 1 million acres versus the June estimate, a move that was abnormally large and directionally atypical. This is an item to monitor on Thursday for any possible changes. CORN VERSUS BEANS Lofty crop expectations reduce the chances that a surprisingly low production number on Thursday could change the bearish market tone, though it might be easier to ignite optimism in corn rather than soybeans. When USDA issued its first official 2024-25 estimates in May, U.S. corn ending stocks were seen rising 4% from 2023-24 and soy stocks were pegged up 31%. But trade estimates for Thursday suggest 2024-25 U.S. soy ending stocks surging 66% on the year versus a more modest 8% increase for corn. Export demand is friendlier for U.S. corn right now versus soybeans. Corn export sales for 2024-25, which began Sept. 1, are on a relatively normal pace. But soybean sales are sluggish compared with USDA\u2019s export targets, putting upward pressure on already ample ending-stock estimates. It is unclear if the agency is prepared to make export cuts at this early stage if the crop size is not reduced. Chicago corn and soybean futures have eased over the last week but remain a bit above last month\u2019s contract lows. Thursday\u2019s data could give traders a feel for whether those lows will hold or if new ones are on the way in the coming weeks. Karen Braun is a market analyst for Reuters. Views expressed above are her own.",

        "Article Content": "Donald Trump said he is not inclined to have another debate with Kamala Harris after initially suggesting several additional matchups to supplement Tuesday\u2019s forum. \u201cI am not inclined to do it because I won the debate by a lot,\u201d the former president said Wednesday morning in an interview on Fox News, contradicting analysts who said the vice president had bested him. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I want to do another debate.\u201d Still, hours later, Trump said he hadn\u2019t completely ruled out another matchup, adding that he had potential broadcast venues in mind if he ultimately decided to move forward with a second contest. \u201cI would do NBC. I\u2019d do Fox too but, right now, we have to determine whether or not we want to,\u201d Trump told reporters in Pennsylvania, during a stop to mark the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The scattershot approach epitomized the former president\u2019s hasty effort to recover from a showdown that saw him largely on the defensive and distracted. The Republican nominee headed to the media spin room shortly after the debate, posted repeatedly on his social media channels through the night, and then appeared early Tuesday morning on the conservative network to declare victory and complain that media coverage had been unfair. While Trump insisted to Fox that Harris\u2019 request for additional debates suggests she lost their showdown, public opinion polls and betting markets indicate the Democratic candidate had the better night. \u201cThe losing person, the fighter, the debater, they always ask for a rematch. I won the debate,\u201d Trump said. Trump said that if Fox News did host a second contest, that it shouldn\u2019t be moderated by Martha MacCallum and Bret Baier because the pair were critical of his performance on the stage in Philadelphia. Earlier: Kamala Harris Baits Trump Into a Debate on Her Terms A month ago, Trump floated three debates with Harris, which included the one held on Tuesday with ABC News and debates to be hosted by Fox News and NBC News. The Harris campaign previously said it would only commit to additional debates if Trump showed up to Tuesday\u2019s event \u2014 and has rejected a debate hosted by Fox. Immediately following the forum, the Harris campaign said the vice president was \u201cready for a second debate.\u201d Fact Checks Tuesday\u2019s debate carried added significance as polls forecast a razor-edged race. A New York Times/Siena College poll on Sunday showed Trump led Harris nationally by a point. Trump had repeatedly railed against Tuesday\u2019s moderators from ABC News for fact-checking various claims the former president made \u2014 including noting that there were no credible reports of immigrants eating animals in Springfield, Ohio, and that abortions couldn\u2019t take place after a baby is born. During the debate, the candidates sparred over numerous topics, including abortion, the economy and the border. A CNN exit poll showed 63% of people who watched the forum said Harris won.",

        "Article Content": "SEOUL, South Korea: North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles toward the sea on Thursday, South Korea\u2019s military said, days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to put his fully ready for battle with its rivals. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected the missiles launched from North Korea's capital flying 360 kilometers (about 220 miles) before landing in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida instructed officials to ensure the safety of ships and aircraft, but there were no immediate reports of damage. The reported fight distances suggest the missiles were designed to attack South Korea. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff condemned the launches as a provocation that poses a serious threat to peace on the Korean Peninsula. The launches were North Korea's first public weapons firing activities in more than two months. On July 1, North Korea claimed to have tested a new tactical weapon capable of delivering a In a Monday speech marking his government's 76th foundation anniversary, Kim said he would redouble efforts to make his nuclear force fully ready for combat with the United States and its allies. Kim made such a pledge saying North Korea faces \u201ca grave threat\u201d because of what he called \u201cthe reckless expansion\u201d of a U.S.-led regional military bloc that is now developing into a nuclear-based one. Kim has made similar vows numerous times, but his latest threat came as outside experts believe North Korea could carry out a nuclear test explosion or long-range missile test launches ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November to boost its leverage in future dealings with the U.S. On Sunday, North Korea's state media published a photo of Kim inspecting a 12-axel vehicle that would be the country's biggest missile launch platform. That sparked speculation that the North could be developing a more powerful intercontinental ballistic missile designed to strike the U.S. mainland. Recent commercial satellite images indicate that North Korea\u2019s northeastern incurred minor damage from heavy summer rains in recent weeks and that no notable recent work was detected at its tunnels, 38 North, a North Korea-focused website, said an analytical piece published Wednesday. Thursday's launches also came after North Korea flew hundreds of huge toward South Korea for five straight days through Sunday. Since 2022, North Korea has sharply ramped up its in part of its efforts to perfect its capabilities to launch strikes on the U.S. and South Korea. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding military drills that North Korea calls invasion rehearsals. Last month, Kim had still held off from missile tests or other provocative military demonstrations as the United States and South Korea conducted large-scale summertime North Korea has previously reacted with other major U.S.-South Korean military training with its own weapons tests. But before the U.S.-South Korean exercises, Kim staged a big ceremony in Pyongyang to mark the delivery of to frontline military units and called for a ceaseless expansion of his country's nuclear program. The Aug. 4 event added to concerns about Kim\u2019s pushes to deploy battlefield nuclear weapons along the tense border with South Korea.",

        "Article Content": "The European Central Bank ( ) cut its key benchmark interest rates for the second time this year as inflation receded towards 2 per cent and concerns loom over economic building, reported the news agency Bloomberg on Thursday, September 12. The ECB's key rate was reduced 25 basis points to 3.5 per cent on Thursday, in line with analyst expectations. The European Central Bank reaffirmed that it cannot commit to a specific path for borrowing , as per the agency report. \u201cBased on the Governing Council\u2019s updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission, it is now appropriate to take another step in moderating the degree of monetary-policy restriction,\u201d they said in a statement, quoted the agency. Traders have reduced their of further easing, estimating a 36 basis points cut more by the end of the year. This means an additional quarter-point cut is fully priced, and there is less than a 50 per cent chance of another similar move, according to the report. Like its global peers, Europe's central bank is becoming more confident that consumer price growth is coming back to target after its historic rise. The euro zone's 20-nation is losing momentum. The households are failing to support the rebound that started earlier in the year, and manufacturers remain in the doldrums due to light demand from outside the single currency area, according to the report. The weakness drove the ECB to trim its forecasts for gross domestic product (GDP) in 2024, 2025, and 2026, now seeing an expansion of 0.8 per cent compared to 0.9 per cent in the last round of quarterly projections. The inflation was broadly kept unchanged, as per the report. Two other rates at which banks can borrow from the ECB were reduced by 60 basis points each as a part of a long-term strategic shift that will have few immediate consequences, according to the agency report. The ECB's decision on Thursday comes less than a week before the US Federal Reserve tip to begin loosening the US interest rates. The Bank of England, meets a day later, they have reduced rates once so far, as per the report. The ECB's announcement comes after fell to 2.2 per cent in August and the figures that the rapid wage increases driving price gains, especially in the services sector, are slowing down, as per the report. Rate cuts cannot be mechanical and must \u201crest on data and analysis,\u201d said Isabel Schnabel, executive board member. Chief Economist Philip Lane said the return to 2% isn\u2019t yet \u201csecured,\u201d though he cautioned that high borrowing costs shouldn\u2019t choke the , as per the report. Europe's sluggish growth can persist long into the future, warned former ECB chief Mario Draghi, cited the agency report. The outlook for the interest rates currently looks somewhat predictable. Analysts in the Bloomberg poll eye cuts each quarter until September 2025, according to the agency report. Goldman Sachs now forecasts reductions at every meeting next year until the deposit rate reaches 2% in July, said the report.",

        "Article Content": "Disgraced ex-movie mogul Harvey Weinstein has been indicted on additional sex crimes charges in New York ahead of a retrial in his landmark #MeToo case, Manhattan prosecutors said at a court hearing Thursday. The indictment will remain under seal until Weinstein is arraigned on the new charges, which could happen as early as Sept 18. Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg disclosed in court that the indictment charges \u201cMr with additional crimes\u201d and that multiple accusers are prepared to testify against him. Weinstein, 72, is recovering from emergency heart surgery Monday at a Manhattan hospital to remove fluid on his heart and lungs and was not at Thursday's hearing. Prosecutors retrying Weinstein's overturned rape conviction disclosed last week that they had begun presenting to a grand jury evidence of up to three additional allegations against Weinstein, dating as far back as the mid-2000s. They include alleged sexual assaults at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, now known as the Roxy Hotel, and in a Lower Manhattan residential building between late 2005 and mid-2006, and an alleged sexual assault at a Tribeca hotel in May 2016. Because the indictment is under seal, it was not known whether the new charges involved some or all of the additional allegations. \u201cWe don't know anything,\" Weinstein's lawyer, Arthur Aidala, said outside court. \u201cWe don't know what the exact accusations are, the exact locations are, what the timing is.\" In April, New York's highest court overturned 2020 conviction on rape and sexual assault charges involving two women and ordered a new trial. Weinstein's retrial is tentatively scheduled to begin Nov. 12. Prosecutors said they would seek to combine any new charges with ones previously brought against Weinstein so that they could be tried together. Weinstein's lawyers oppose that, arguing that prosecutors were seeking to bolster their original case with additional charges involving other accusers. Aidala said Weinstein's defence team won't be ready to go to trial in November on the new charges. By law, he said, they'll have 45 days to file court papers challenging the prosecution's request to try the original and new indictments at the same time, pushing the fight into the weeks before a possible trial. new charges come after prosecutors in Britain announced last week that they would no longer pursue charges of indecent assault against Weinstein, who was the most prominent villain of the #MeToo movement in 2017 when women began going public with accounts of his behavior. Weinstein, who co-founded the film and television production companies Miramax and The Weinstein Company, has long maintained that any sexual activity was consensual. Also Thursday, Judge Curtis Farber granted a defense request to have the ailing Weinstein remain at Bellevue Hospital indefinitely instead of being moved back to the infirmary ward at New York City's Rikers Island jail complex. Farber also ordered Weinstein's attending physician at Rikers Island to testify at a closed-door hearing about the ex-studio boss' health issues. Weinstein's surgery Monday came after his third trip to Bellevue Hospital to have fluid drained, Farber said. He has a variety of maladies requiring medication and treatment that causes him to retain water in his arms, legs, abdomen and around his heart, and he needs constant monitoring to ensure the buildup of fluids isn't deadly, the judge said. \u201cIf Mr Weinstein dies because no one has taken the authority to stop what may be the death of Mr Weinstein because of this back-and-forth transfer from one institution to another, it would be a miscarriage of justice to say the least,\u201d Weinstein's lawyer Barry Kamins told Farber. \u201cIt would be a travesty of justice.\u201d Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office had signaled for months that new charges were imminent against Weinstein, who was once one of the most powerful people in Hollywood, having produced films such as \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cThe Crying Game.\u201d In July, prosecutors told a judge they were actively pursuing claims of rape that occurred in Manhattan within the statute of limitations. They said some potential accusers who were not ready to come forward during Weinstein's first New York trial had indicated they were now willing to testify. In vacating Weinstein's conviction, New York's Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge, James M Burke, unfairly allowed testimony against him based on allegations from other women that were not part of the case. Burke is no longer on the bench. Prosecutors have said one of the accusers in that case, Jessica Mann, is prepared to testify against him again. It's unclear if the second accuser, Mimi Haley, would participate. Her lawyer, Gloria Allred, declined to comment. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann did. Weinstein, who had been serving a 23-year sentence in New York when his conviction was quashed, was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape. His 16-year prison sentence in that case still stands, but his lawyers appealed in June, arguing he did not get a fair trial in Los Angeles. Weinstein has remained in custody in New York's Rikers Island jail complex while awaiting the retrial.",

        "Article Content": "By Jamie McGeever Sept 13 - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets. Asian stocks are poised to end the week on a strong footing on Friday, spurred on by another solid rise on Wall Street the day before that puts some key benchmark indexes across the continent on track to register modest weekly gains. The European Central Bank cut interest rates on Thursday and the Fed is set to begin a pretty substantial easing cycle next week. Although the former was no surprise and traders have been expecting the latter for a while, they are conducive to a 'risk on' environment that should boost sentiment in Asia on Friday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both rose for a fourth consecutive day on Thursday. The S&P 500 came within 1% of its record high struck on July 15 and the Nasdaq, up 5.3% so far this week, is on track for its biggest weekly rise this year. In other good news, Japan's Nikkei on Thursday snapped a seven-day losing streak in style, jumping 3.4%. Notably, it did so without the help of a weaker yen - the yen made a new high for the year against the dollar and although it recoiled, it still ended Thursday slightly stronger. But if yen strength is to persist, the outlook for Japanese stocks is murky. Indeed, the outlook for global asset prices may also be murky if the yen carry trade unwind has further to run, as SocGen strategists expect. This creates \"clear market risks as market leverage in this cycle comes mainly from the Japanese currency,\" they said on Thursday, adding that they are increasing their yen exposure and reducing their Japanese equities exposure. If markets across Asia are set to end the week on a high, the exception once again could be China. Shanghai stocks on Thursday posted their lowest close since January 2019. Shanghai's blue chip index will likely end the week in the red, its fourth weekly fall in a row and the 14th decline out of the last 17 weeks. It's been a miserable run that has seen the index lose 15%, but surely it has to turn at some point. Right? A batch of top-tier economic data from China over the weekend could be the trigger although that may require some rare upside surprises. Beijing releases house price, investment, industrial production and retail sales figures for August on Saturday, and economists polled by Reuters generally expect the numbers to come in weaker than July's readings. The calendar in Asia on Friday, meanwhile, sees the release of Indian wholesale price inflation, a speech by Bank of Thailand governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput and Bank of Japan board member Naoki Tamura. Here are key developments that could provide more direction to Asian markets on Friday: - India WPI inflation - South Korea import & export prices - New Zealand manufacturing PMI",

Nonetheless, he recognized that some issues remain unresolved. Jaishankar also pointed out that the relationship between India and China has historically been challenging. \u201cWe did not have an easy relationship in the past.

They had bad periods in history. Both of them are reviving and are rejuvenating in a way... They are the only two countries that have a population of more than a billion. And what happens normally when any country rises is that it has a ripple effect on the neighbourhood. These two countries also have the honour of being each other's neighbours.

This figure represents a substantial 55% increase from FY23\u2019s 268 crore, according to Nazara's filings with the BSE, and a leap from FY22\u2019s 102.3 crore. Moonshine Technology Pvt. Ltd (MTPL) is the parent of several key subsidiaries and operates PokerBaazi and SportsBaazi, a brand offering sports, casual and fantasy gaming, including cricket. The subsidiaries under which these brands are housed are Ross Technologies Pvt. Ltd, Baazi Networks Pvt. Ltd, Baazi Games Pvt. Ltd and SBN Gaming Network Pvt. Ltd.

        "Article Content": "Goa: The 20th Maritime State Development Council (MSDC) in Goa concluded on Friday with remarkable outcomes for India\u2019s maritime sector, including plans for a huge shipbuilding park spanning multiple states. This ambitious initiative aims to consolidate shipbuilding capabilities across regions, fostering greater efficiency and innovation. The two-day event also saw the resolution of more than 80 critical issues between the union government, states and Union Territories including port infrastructure modernisation, connectivity and security; statutory compliances; maritime tourism; navigation projects; and sustainability. Several new and emerging challenges were also addressed, including the establishment of places of refuge for ships in distress, the development of radioactive detection equipment infrastructure to enhance security at ports, and recognising seafarers as essential workers and ensuring better working conditions and access to shore leave, a statement from ministry of ports, shipping and waterways said. Also read: The implementation of a state ranking framework and a port ranking system was also discussed at the meeting, with the aim of fostering healthy competition and improving performance across India's maritime sector. The meeting was chaired by Sarbananda Sonowal, union minister of ports, shipping and waterways. Others in attendance included Shantanu Thakur, minister of state for ports, shipping and waterways; Aleixo Sequeira, minister of captain of ports, Goa; Devendra Kumar Joshi, lieutenant governor, Andaman & Nicobar; Mankala S Vaidya, minister of fisheries, ports, and inland water transport, Karnataka; Thiru EV Velu, public works department minister, Tamil Nadu; and TK Ramachandran, secretary of the ports and shipping ministry. At the meeting, Sonowal, emphasised the significance of MSDC\u2019s contribution, saying, \u201cMSDC has been instrumental in aligning policies and initiatives like the Indian Ports Bill and the Sagarmala program. MSDC\u2019s efforts over the past two decades have facilitated the growth of over 50 non-major ports, which now handle more than 50% of India\u2019s annual cargo. As major ports approach saturation, these non-major ports will play a crucial role in the future of India\u2019s maritime sector.\u201d He added that the Indian Maritime sector was growing like never before. The foundation stone of India\u2019s 13th major port, worth 76,220 crores, was laid at Vadhavan in Maharashtra on 30 August, and the government has designated Galathea Bay in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands as another major port. This 44,000-crore project will be developed through a public-private partnership and aims to capture transshipped cargo currently handled outside India. The first phase is expected to be operational by 2029, Sonowal said. The Sagarmala program, approved by the Union cabinet in 2015, envisions a total of 839 projects completion by 2035 with an estimated investment of 5.79 trillion. Of these, 262 projects have already been completed at a cost of about 1.40 trillion, and another 217 projects valued at around 1.65 trillion, are currently being implemented. These projects span several sectors and require coordination between union ministries, state governments, major ports and various other agencies. Also read: To improve the ease of doing business in the maritime sector, the MSDC launched a National Safety in Ports Committee (NSPC) application on the National Single Window System. It aims to streamline regulatory processes, improve efficiency and reduce costs. The platform allows for real-time performance monitoring to enhance the operational efficiency of various departments through better information sharing. The launch of the Indian International Maritime Dispute Resolution Centre (IIMDRC) also marks a significant milestone. This platform will offer merit-based and industry-governed solutions to resolve maritime disputes efficiently, addressing the multi-modal, multi-contract, multi-jurisdictional, and multinational nature of maritime transactions. IIMDRC positions India as a global hub for arbitration, aligning with the \u2018Resolve in India\u2019 initiative. Another noteworthy launch was that of the Indian Maritime Centre (IMC), a policy think tank designed to bring together maritime stakeholders who currently operate in silos. IMC is aimed at fostering innovation, knowledge sharing and strategic planning. A highlight of the event was the keel-laying ceremony for India\u2019s largest dredger, a 12,000 cubic metre trailer suction hopper dredger at Cochin Shipyard Limited, built in collaboration with IHC Holland. Several maritime boards presented their innovations at MSDC. The Kerala Maritime Board showcased its techniques for monetising dredging efforts, while the Gujarat Maritime Board shared a case study on port-driven urban development initiatives. The Andhra Pradesh Maritime Board presented a maritime development masterplan, and the Indian Coast Guard shared a successful case study on the Maersk Frankfurt fire rescue operation. Also read: Sonowal also spoke about the National Maritime Heritage Complex (NMHC) at Lothal, Gujarat, which he said would serve as an international tourist destination showcasing India\u2019s rich maritime heritage. The NMHC will see international collaborations with 25 countries. MoUs have been signed with Portugal, the UAE, and Vietnam, and talks with France, Norway, Iran and Myanmar in advanced stages. Maharashtra and Gujarat have already developed their state pavilions for NMHC, and coastal states have been encouraged to participate and showcase their maritime heritage.",

India is also ready to share its expertise in using digital technology as \u2018public goods\u2019 to promote financial inclusion and productivity, he said, speaking at the 23rd meeting of ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). The use of digital technology as \u2018public goods\u2019 has led to widespread benefit for Indians irrespective of their financial position, he added. India has been actively engaging with international bodies such as the UN and the G20 to facilitate the exportation of its successful digital initiatives. The government seeks to establish a framework for certifying and benchmarking its DPIs and digital public goods (DPGs), spurred by the success of programs like CoWin that was used to track administration of covid vaccination and UPI that millions of Indians use for real-time bank transfers from their mobile phones. Known as the Indian Stack, India's digital infrastructure encompasses various platforms, including Aadhaar, Digital Locker, DigiYatra, UPI, developed through multi-sector collaboration, aiming to streamline access to government services and foster inclusive growth. The goal of DPI is to provide a seamless and efficient way for citizens to access government services and promote inclusive development. Meanwhile, the Indian government has set a target to achieve at least 500 GW of non-fossil fuel installed capacity, which includes 280 GW of solar power and 140 GW of wind power projects, by 2030. Speaking at the 23rd meeting of ministers of the SCO responsible for foreign economic and foreign trade activities, Barthwal also said paperless trading is a critical step towards streamlining cross-border transactions. \u201cThe Commerce Secretary emphasised the need for strong connectivity to foster trade and economic development. However, while making such efforts to bolster connectivity projects, it is essential to build trust as well as transparency in our cooperative efforts,\u201d India\u2019s commerce ministry said in a statement. During the meeting, the SCO ministers approved three documents covering different areas of cooperation: They also adopted a statement on issues of fair trade and sustainable development, the commerce ministry added.",

The general thumb rule is that banks tend to offer higher interest rates for and lower rates for shorter duration. For instance, a five-year FD will offer a higher interest rate than a one-year FD. However, a handful of banks typically offer specific tenor , for which they offer a special interest rate. Union Bank of India, for instance, has rolled out a fixed deposit (FD) scheme for 333 days, known as Union Sumvridhi, that offers interest up to 8.15 per cent to depositors. The minimum deposit amount is 1,000 while the maximum is 3 crore. The rate of interest will be 7.4 percent for general citizens, 7.90 percent for senior citizens and 8.15 percent for super senior citizens. The interest on your will be calculated, compounded quarterly, and credited to the deposit account at a half-yearly interval. The deposit's interest will be paid along with the principal at the time of maturity. In case of pre-closure of fixed deposits interest will be paid at 1 per cent less than the applicable rate for the period for which it has actually remained with the bank or contracted rate, whichever is lower.

        "Article Content": "Planemaker Boeing is facing another challenge. As if the existing ones weren\u2019t enough, the machinists union overwhelmingly voted for a strike, rejecting the contract which was offered and the strike has now begun. This comes within a week of Boeing calling this contract \u201chistoric\u201d. The strike, the first in 16 years, coincides with the first full negotiation of wages in as many years, with the last two being extensions of the contract signed in 2008. About 30,000 workers in the Seattle and Portland areas have started the strike, which started at 0001 hours on Friday, September 13. Boeing put out a What to Expect page for striking workers, which clearly mentions that they would not be paid for the strike. However, the aeroplane maker did say that it hopes to work out a solution and a new contract soon. In July this year, Boeing announced the acquisition of Spirit Aerosystems after being constantly on the radar of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for quality issues and not being allowed to increase the production rate of its planes till quality issues are fixed. Recently, Boeing\u2019s 777X was grounded during the testing phase as issues with engine assembly came to the fore. The aircraft is already delayed for its Entry In Service (EIS). It remains unclear how long the strike will last. Both Boeing and the union would soon be back at the table along with back-channel talks to ensure that the impasse is resolved. However, until then, the production will come to a near halt and so would be the deliveries, in most cases. Akasa Air has a couple of aircraft ready for delivery and took delivery of its 25th aircraft recently, after a lull since February 2024. This was the first aircraft it took this financial year. The delay of a plane ready for delivery could mean it may have to withhold its planned expansion and the airline will hope that the delivery is done before the peak Diwali period. Apart from this, the airline may also miss out on the immediate Sale and Leaseback gains. The other carrier to be impacted could be Air India Express. The airline had declared that it would induct 50 planes in 15 months in October 2023. Over 30 have been inducted in 11 months and the next one-and-a-half dozen planes could already be impacted due to rework. A strike now means there could be further delay and derailment in the induction plan, which would likely lead to Air India Express not being able to achieve the target of 50 planes by mid-January of next year. The airline, though, may not be as worried as Akasa Air about Sale and Leaseback income but would have its sights on the precious slots at airports, which could go to competition. Also Read: SpiceJet also has the MAX on order but is not in a position financially to induct any. In fact it has seen a handful of MAX in its fleet being flown out by lessors for lack of payments and continues to struggle with finances. The airline has relied on wet/damp-leased aircraft in the past. A delayed delivery schedule due to strike could mean that wet leases are in demand and will see the costs go up, impacting SpiceJet indirectly. The impact of the strike on the B777X remains uncertain. The aircraft was to enter commercial service in 2020 but is now slated for the second half of 2025, which could see further slip-up. IndiGo has no Boeings on order, while Air India\u2019s Dreamliner order will be serviced from Boeing\u2019s plant in South Carolina and not Washington, where the strike is in progress. Boeing sources over $1 billion worth of services and goods from India, for a mix of both civil and defence products, with the split remaining confidential. How much of an impact this has on the suppliers in India will be known over the next few weeks and will depend on how long the strike lasts. In the global connected supply chains of today, the impact beyond the core striking area is a common phenomenon. This year, the airline has had a and this is not the best of welcomes for any CEO, lesser so at the troubled plane maker. Ironically, the planemaker has continued to make statements around quality being core to its business and that it has taken all actions needed to maintain it, yet has seen one incident after another. This is especially surprising since the MAX was grounded following two deadly crashes. The union\u2019s decision to strike is either a hard reset, much needed for the business or another thorn in the aeroplane maker's recovery. As Airbus struggles to find slots for airlines, Boeing\u2019s chance to capture its faltering market has had another hit.",

        "Article Content": "New Delhi: Despite being one of the leading exporters of agri-food and organic products, India has yet to fully prioritize exports and address trade challenges linked to the sustainable food system (SFS), according to think tank Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER). A sustainable food system (SFS), as defined by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, ensures food security and nutrition without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs, balancing economic, social, and environmental aspects. The issues concerning SFS impacting trade include sporadic bans on exports of products due to global shortages or domestic price increases, rejection of exports in key markets for not adhering to sanitary and phytosanitary standards, lack of a single nodal agency for export quality control, limited discussions and collaborations on SFS through trade agreements, and lack of product specific export strategy and data, ICRIER said in its September policy brief. \"Despite the growing emphasis by the centre and state governments on transitioning to a sustainable food system in India, significant gaps and challenges remain,\" said the \u00a0policy brief titled, 'Sustainable Food Systems and India's Trade Agreements'. \"To advance towards a sustainable food system, India must address these challenges, examine its policies and policy gaps, align policies with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) and replicate success stories to boost the global competitiveness of India\u2019s agri-food sector,\" it said. : \"Cross\u2013border collaborations through MRAs (Mutual Recognition Agreements) and under trade agreements focused on sustainable food systems are essential to expand India\u2019s agri-food exports and strengthen the resilience of the food system,\" the think tank added. During April-June quarter, India's agri-exports stood at $8.44 billion, up from $8.39 billion during the same quarter of the previous year, according to the commerce ministry data. Overall, India's agri-exports stood at $33.24 billion in FY24, up from $32.43 billion in the same period of the previous year. ICRIER also recommended a vision document or roadmap for SFS for an integrated food system, ensuring sustainability across the entire food supply chain, from production to consumption and waste management. Also Read: \"Since SFS is in the domain of multiple regulatory agencies at the centre and the states, a master policy document laying down the vision of the country and a roadmap towards achieving it in the short, medium and long term will help in budget allocation, ensure co-ordinated efforts and comprehensive solutions,\" it said. ICRIER's September policy brief also recommended streamlining processes for smooth co-ordination across multiple regulators, addressing regulatory gaps, implementing farm-to-fork product traceability, facilitating easy access to data and information, reducing trade barriers by strengthening quality testing and certification, allocating higher budget for SFS, and implementing a targeted tax incentive or subsidy programme for nutritious foods. \"There is a need for India to discuss cooperation on SFS in international forums, including its trade agreements. While many measures have been taken by the Indian government on SFS, the country seems to have a defensive positive in trade agreements,\" it said.",

        "Article Content": "Bajaj Housing Finance IPO\u2019s record-breaking subscription presents a more concerning scenario compared to the 12-crore IPO of Resourceful Automobile, an SME company, which attracted bids worth 4,800 crore. The 6,560-crore IPO of Bajaj Housing Finance set a new record, with subscriptions exceeding 3 lakh crore. The IPO was oversubscribed 63.61 times, receiving bids for over 4,628 crore equity shares, against the 72.75 crore shares available on the BSE and NSE. At the upper end of the price band, the applications for shares were valued at nearly 3.24 lakh crore. pointed out that such a massive volume of bids would result in the locking of approximately 3 lakh crore in bank accounts, which would not be accessible to investors in the event of a significant market downturn. \u201cThis is way more scary than a little 2 showroom SME getting bids of 4000 cr. Because when you have 300,000 cr. locked in bank accounts, this much money is not available for people to buy if the market tanks in the next two days. Just two days, of course. Number way scarier tho,\u201d Shenoy wrote in a post on X. He emphasized that the systemic risk associated with the Bajaj Housing Finance IPO is significantly higher, while the outrage over the large oversubscription for the Resourceful Automobile IPO is misplaced. \u201cWhat i really wanted to say is, the outrage over a tiny ipo getting oversubed when you have asba from money in people\u2019s own albank acs is stupid. If you wanna outrage, the systemic risk is higher in the bajaj ipo. But who cares yaar. Story mein dum chahiye,\u201d he added. Both IPOs, namely Bajaj Housing Finance IPO and the , use the ASBA (Application Supported by Blocked Amount) mechanism, wherein investors\u2019 funds are blocked in their bank accounts but not debited until the shares are allotted. This results in the funds being temporarily unavailable for other market activities. In the case of large IPOs like Bajaj Housing Finance, this can cause a significant liquidity squeeze, especially if market volatility increases during the IPO period. For , 3 lakh crore worth funds are essentially locked in bank accounts for a few days. Shenoy argues that this creates a \u201csystemic risk\u201d as the sheer size of this IPO locks up such a large amount of capital that, if the market falls, there won\u2019t be enough liquidity available for buying activity, potentially worsening the impact of a crash. This kind of risk isn\u2019t seen in smaller IPOs like that of Resourceful Automobile. Resourceful Automobile IPO, while making headlines for being oversubscribed, was much smaller in size - 12 crore IPO attracting 4,800 crore in bids. The funds locked in this case are relatively small compared to the Bajaj Housing Finance IPO. Despite this, there was outrage all over due to the extreme oversubscription. Shenoy dismisses this outrage as \u201cstupid\u201d because, even though Resourceful Automobile\u2019s IPO attracted a significant number of bids relative to its size, the overall impact on the broader market was minimal. The funds locked in this case did not pose a systemic risk since they were small in comparison to larger IPOs like Bajaj Housing Finance.",

I tweeted about this problem earlier as well and had advised investors to opt for Internet banking instead of UPI,\u201d he wrote. Some users wrote that they faced this issue with Zerodha and GPay. Zerodha responded by saying they are just intermediaries who submit the application and have no control over the mandate. Some people also said that the bank's IPO platforms were choked, and one Amit Sethi claimed that Axis Bank's ASBA facility was down while other banks were also down. \u201cAfter BajajIPO it\u2019s clear that banks are not ready to handle payment mandates of this large scale.

        "Article Content": "Bitcoin price traded lower on Friday, falling for the fourth consecutive trading session, dragged by wider selloff in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin price was at $55,510, down 5.82% over the past 24 hours, with the tokens market capitalization at $1.11 trillion. So far this year, Bitcoin price has rallied 35.39%. Among other digital assets, smaller coins like Ethereum prices fell 8.4% to $2,954.16, Solana was down 9.55% to $123.08 and XRP declined 12.48% to $0.400. Bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $73,798 in March, buoyed by strong demand for inaugural US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. However, the inflows in the token ETF have since ebbed, weighing on the Bitcoin prices. Moreover, approvals for debut US ETFs for second largest token Ether are pending. Crypto prices were pressurized by falling demand for US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The political developments in the US and signs that governments are disposing of seized tokens also weighed on Bitcoin prices. \u201cBitcoin (BTC) experienced a wave of liquidations totaling $121.29 million as long positions were forced to close amid mounting losses. Over the past month, Bitcoin has fallen by 15%, reflecting heightened market volatility and bearish sentiment. There can be additional resistance to reach the $60k levels as bears dominate the market due to liquidations, whale movements, miner sell offs, etc. The asset sell off by the German government are adding to the volatility in BTC,\u201d said Rajagopal Menon, VP, WazirX. According to a Bloomberg report, administrators of the failed Mt. Gox exchange are returning a hoard of Bitcoin to creditors in stages. Speculators are uncertain how much of the $8 billion haul will end up being sold. A Mt. Gox-linked wallet moved $2.7 billion worth of the token on Friday, according to Arkham Intelligence. On the other hand, global equity markets have rallied and the MSCI Inc.\u2019s gauge of global stocks is hovering near a record high. A short-term, 30-day correlation between Bitcoin and the index is plunging. Investors are awaiting the US nonfarm payrolls data to be released later today for the outlook on the US Federal Reserve\u2019s potential interest rate cuts. Weak economic data in the US have bolstered the case for the Fed rate cut in coming months. \u201cUS Federal Reserve Chair has hinted at larger than anticipated rate cuts but there is no timeline as for when it will happen. This scenario is viewed as bullish for Bitcoin and major altcoins. Additionally easing of miner sell off could ease the pressure on the market in the coming weeks,\u201d Menon said.",

Further, the world's largest in terms of market cap shed some of its 12 per cent weekly gains, even as world markets signalled green. Besides Bitcoin, was also down 9 per cent \u2014 a two-month low for the crypto. Other smaller coins, such as Cardano and XRP, also clocked losses exceeding 10 per cent, as per Bloomberg. Traders had anticipated the dumping of long-lost from Mt. Gox, a defunct Japanese crypto exchange, which media reports said would return Bitcoin to creditors and further \u201cspooked\u201d selling from leverage players, the Reuters report added. Mt. Gox collapsed in 2014. There are fears that the $8 billion worth of tokens being released in stages would drive more selling. The Bloomberg report cited Arkham Intelligence to note that a Mt. Gox-linked wallet alone moved $2.7 billion worth of its tokens on July 5. \u201cThe selling pressure is still related to creditor selling from the failed Mt Gox exchange. However, the acceleration to the downside suggests the market is trying to get ahead of the creditor flows,\u201d Tony Sycamore, a analyst at IG, told Reuters. There is also uncertainty over the Democrats replacing as their presidential nominee with someone less crypto-friendly. The Reuters report added that the early boost from US-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also seems to have petered out. Bitcoin had touched a record $73,803.25 in March on the back of Bitcoin ETF. On a likely up chance, Stefan von Haenisch, head of trading at OSL SG Pte, told Bloomberg that the crypto market needs \u201cmore dovish notes on monetary policy from the \u201d and that \u201cone to two rate cuts, coupled with Fed balance sheet expansion, are two key ingredients that crypto is really waiting for.\u201d The Bloomberg report also noted that investors are awaiting job data to gauge the Fed's likely move.",

        "Article Content": "Bitcoin surged above $60,000 following Donald Trump's bold response to an assassination attempt, leading to speculation that his presidential election prospects have strengthened, according to Bloomberg report. The former president, known for his supportive stance on cryptocurrency, reported being shot in the right ear during gunfire at a political rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. His campaign assured the public of his well-being, confirming he was \"fine\" and eager to attend the upcoming Republican National Convention starting Monday in Milwaukee. \u201cIf the assassination attempt on Trump positively impacts Bitcoin\u2019s price, then it would be one of the most bizzare catalysts for Bitcoin\u2019s price surge. According to Polymarket, odds for Trump becoming President shot up to 70% after today's incident. In the last few weeks, Trump has positioned himself as pro-crypto. The crypto markets are also relieved by the news that Germany has finished selling its Bitcoin. So overall, these are interesting developments based on impulses and voter sentiment but BTC would need stronger factors to back its price surge,\" said Rajagopal Menon, VP, WazirX. PredictIt data indicated an increase in Trump's chances of winning the presidency again following today's events. Images of Trump defiantly raising his fist with a bloody right ear, against the backdrop of the American flag, have gone viral on social media and television since the incident. \u201cOne of the reasons for the market response is Donald Trump\u2019s rise in popularity. In the run up to the US presidential elections in November, Trump has positioned himself as a pro-crypto advocate. He has started accepting cryptocurrency donations for his campaign,\u201d said CoinSwitch Markets Desk. President Joe Biden expressed relief that Trump was safe and strongly denounced the violence. The markets are expected to react with increased volatility, possibly mirroring the trades seen during last month's debate, which favored Trump. During that period, the US dollar strengthened and Treasury yields rose. \u201cFollowing a recent downturn driven by uncertainty surrounding the Mt. Gox BTC distribution and the actions of the German government's Bitcoin sell-off, BTC experienced a significant slump over the past nine days, dropping from over $58,000 to just under $54,000. With no further sell-offs anticipated from the German government, the absence of this downward pressure is expected to pave the way for a potential upward movement in Bitcoin's price, a trend already underway as BTC surpasses $60,000,\u201d said Sumit Gupta, co-founder, CoinDCX. Bitcoin surged by up to 2.7% to $60,160.71 as of 1:05 a.m. in New York. The leading cryptocurrency had stabilized recently, buoyed by optimism surrounding ETFs from major players such as BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, which are seen as providing stable demand that could mitigate price fluctuations. Gupta further added, \u201cAs economic indicators point towards a likely interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, there is heightened anticipation of increased investor interest in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Despite recent inflationary pressures indicated by the Producer Price Index (PPI), Bitcoin's upward trajectory confirms its status as a favored alternative asset.\u201d",

        "Article Content": "(BTC) surged over 3 per cent on Wednesday, reaching $65,758 at 12pm (India). BTC has experienced high traction among investors due to increased inflows and positive sentiments following an assassination attempt on US presidential candidate Donald Trump, which has significantly increased the odds of the former president winning the upcoming election. Major altcoins have also benefited from 's rise. Ethereum (ETH), BNB, Tether, XRP (11%), Dogecoin, Cardano, Tron, Avalanche, and Shiba Inu have seen gains of up to 11% during this period. Conversely, Toncoin was among the losers, declining by over 1%. \u201cBitcoin has stayed strong despite the large sell off by German government. Mt. Gox settlements have started flowing to customers. This will not be a mass sell off like the German government exercise but people are still being cautious. These have been multi billion dollar sell events and yet, Bitcoin continues to hold strong. It\u2019s good to see such liquidity in BTC, it has helped build more confidence amongst the market participants. We\u2019re in the maturing market phase for Bitcoin. It is going through a cycle where we get to see how it reacts to large sell off events. It has proven to do well until now!,\u201d said Nischal Shetty, CoFounder, Shardeum. On Monday, lifetime net inflows into these ETFs exceeded $16 billion, with market bulls now aiming for the $71,500 level. Despite Mt. Gox's decision to move 91,755 BTC valued at $5.8 billion, BTC remained stable above the $65K mark, unaffected by the development. According to CoinSwitch Markets Desk, have attracted over $16 billion in inflows since their launch in January, with $300 million added earlier this week alone. The funds, primarily BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, have seen consistent inflows despite fluctuations in Bitcoin prices, highlighting strong investor demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. The top mover of the day remained worldcoin\u2019s WLD (+20%), the Sam Altman related token\u2019s long bearish run ended. \u201cIgnoring headwinds like Mt. Gox repaying users ($6 billion in BTC), Bitcoin defies gravity, reaching a four-week high above $65,800. Unlike the German government's intense sell-out, the market might not react badly to the gradual sellout of these funds. Altcoins like XRP (37% up) and Near Protocol (36.8% up) are leading the charge, fueling overall crypto optimism. Historically, July outperforms June for Bitcoin, and this year seems to follow suit despite recentchallenges,\u201d said Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder & CEO, Pi42.",

The tax rate on long-term capital gains for all financial and non-financial assets will rise from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent. For certain financial assets, the tax rate on short-term gains will increase from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. Budget 2024 marks the seventh consecutive presentation by Nirmala Sitharaman, and the first in Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s third term. The budget mainly witnessed major tax changes and focused on employment creation.",

        "Article Content": "Ambitious investors with high-risk appetite tend to opt for to make quick returns and at times \u2013 to make huge returns in the long run. Sadly, from time to time, some fraud here, and another hack there shakes the boat to such an extent that cryptocurrencies as an investment instrument get a bad name and are seen as a hot potato, particularly for retail investors. Last month WazirX, a leading crypto exchange in India, saw a massive security breach leading to the , which accounted for 45 percent of customers\u2019 funds. The reportedly included $100 million worth of shiba inu and $52 million in ether. Interestingly, this was not the first time that such a massive loss took place in the crypto sector. From FTX in the US and Quadriga in Canada to digital currencies scam in Uttarakhand, a slew of frauds occurred in the recent past, thus shaking the trust of investors in cryptos as an asset class. But what one would wonder is whether it is rational to invest in cryptocurrencies when such massive scams can reel the sector and leave a major crypto exchange beleaguered with a loss of gigantic proportions. In the , there was no explicit positive development that could please crypto currency investors while 1 percent TDS on crypto transactions continues. For the optimists, there are numerous reasons to stay upbeat. One of them is US Presidential nominee for Republicans who started accepting crypto donations in May and recently stated at Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, that if crypto is going to define the future, \u201cI want [it] to be mined, minted and made in the USA. If bitcoin is going to the moon ... I want America to be the nation that leads the way,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, back home in India, stakeholders of the crypto sector are more enthused than not. Balaji Srihari, Business Head, CoinSwitch, says, \u201cI understand that the recent hacking incident was unfortunate but it is not wise to let this single event overshadow the entire ecosystem. Instead, we should focus on learning from these challenges and improving security measures, recognizing that safeguarding user interests is an ongoing endeavor.\u201d \"Crypto ecosystem is heavily influenced by global macroeconomic conditions. Recent developments, such as the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations in Europe, the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the United States, and discussions by former leaders about establishing Bitcoin reserves, highlight the growing significance of crypto,\" he adds. Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, says, \"Bitcoin is currently riding a wave of positive momentum amid heightened trading activity spurred by former President Trump\u2019s announcement to establish Bitcoin as a US strategic asset at Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville. The global cryptocurrency market is reflecting this enthusiasm, boasting a market cap of $2.47 trillion. This surge in interest highlights the growing confidence among investors and the broader crypto community.\u201d To sum up, one can view a hack or as an accident of sorts and move on, while it can also be seen as symptomatic of an unregulated scheme of things where risk outweighs gain.",

        "Article Content": "Bitcoin tumbled over 10 per cent at one point, before bouncing to trade at $54,333 at 9.17 am in Singapore on August 5, Bloomberg reported. The digital currency in fact had its worst week since the shook crypto markets in 2022, losing 13.1 per cent over the past seven days, it added. Later in the day, near 7 am in London, Bitcoin was trading lower at $53,100; and Ether shed over a fifth of its value before paring some of the slide to change hands at $2,360, as per a Bloomberg update. Most major , including meme-token Dogecoin, were deeply in the red. The world's largest is under pressure due to risk aversion in global markets, and even smaller tokens such as Ether and meme-themed sank under \u201cheavy losses\u201d, the report said. Early in the day, slid to its weakest since mid-January and was last down 16 per cent at $2,300, Reuters reported. As much as $760 million of crypto positions using derivatives were liquidated in the past 24 hours, Coinglass data showed, a sign of leveraged bets coming unstuck, Bloomberg reported. Himanshu Maradiya, Founder and Chairman, CIFDAQ said that the selloff in , including Bitcoin, can be attributed to a confluence of economic factors and one of the major repayments. \u201cThis one significant repayment of approximately $8 billion worth of BTC related to the , caused investor anxiety about increased market supply. Weak US labour data and subsequent recession fears have prompted expectations of deeper rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, causing investors to shift their assets towards safer options. This movement has not only affected high-yielding currencies and equities but also significantly impacted the crypto market,\u201d Maradiya said. He added that as react to these economic signals, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are experiencing heightened volatility. According to Bloomberg, growing concerns around the global and questions of a possible bubble created by heavy investments into (AI), have pushed global stock selloffs and impacted the crypto side as well. Further, markets have displayed \u201cskittishness\u201d given the tense geopolitical situation in the Middle East, and while they await the United States Federal Reserve's ( ) upcoming policy meet outcome. Bond traders have amplified bets on US interest-rate cuts beginning in September to support economic expansion. The volatility in stock markets has \u201cincreased the likelihood of less restrictive monetary policy coming sooner rather than later \u2014 a good thing for ,\u201d Sean Farrell, head of digital-asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors LLC told Bloomberg. In the US, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ( ) saw their largest outflows in around three months on August 2. Its moving average price also slumped, with Tony Sycamore, analyst at IG Australia Pty, noting that the technical chart pattern \u201copens the way for a deeper pullback\u201d toward $54,000. The token hit a record $73,798 high in March 2024, but has since been pulled back by various factors including uncertainty ahead of the US presidential race in November. Notably, Republican candidate has positioned himself as \u201cpro-crypto\u201d, while opponent and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has yet to outline her policy stance on digital assets, Bloomberg report said. The cryptocurrency is off nearly 20% from its March 2024 high, as per the Reuters report. Also hanging over the market are possible sales of seized by governments and the risk of a supply overhang from tokens returned to creditors through bankruptcy proceedings. Bitcoin is still a lucrative investment. Its year-to-date (YTD) advance has moderated to around 25 per cent, compared with 18 per cent ascent and a 9 per cent climb in global stocks, the Bloomberg report added. \u201cWe anticipate that the current correction phase will pave the way for more stable growth as the macroeconomic landscape stabilises. Our analysis suggests that despite short-term fluctuations, the underlying fundamentals of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem remain strong, positioning them for resilience and long-term potential,\u201d Maradiya added.",

It is interesting to note that this is not the first time that the government has been evasive about its commitment to establishing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. Union Finance and Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently stated that there should be a and merely rolling out regulations by one country was not going to make much headway into the space of regulations. In November 2021, Sitharaman \u2014 in a reply to a question on bitcoin in Parliament \u2014 had said that the government has as a currency.

More recently, the upcoming 2024 US elections are also a looming uncertainty, as Democratic candidate Kamala Harris is yet to detail her stance on digital assets. Rival Donald Trump has declared himself pro-crypto. As of 1 pm on August 20, Bitcoin rose 3.2 per cent to $60,982.31; and rose 2.2 per cent to $2,674.77. According to the Bloomberg report, Bitcoin has slipped close to 9 per cent so far in August 2024. The world's largest is lagging a gain of almost 1 per cent in MSCI Inc.\u2019s world share index and a jump in gold to all-time highs. A Bloomberg global bond gauge has added nearly 2 per cent over the same period. Analysts told the publication that the $12 billion worth of crypto seized by the US government is at \"risk of disposal\" and is a challenge. Arkham Intelligence tracked data to note that the US moved $600 million worth of confiscated Bitcoin to a wallet operated by Coinbase, the report added. Possible US government sales are resulting in this temporary downward price pressure. We expect this gap to close soon,\u201d Khushboo Khullar, venture partner at Lightning Ventures told Bloomberg. On August 5, a gauge of the top 100 digital assets showed its worst performance since November 2022 as equities sank on fears of a US economic downturn and lower yen \"damaged risk appetite worldwide\", the report said. However, despite expectations for the economy that have since turned better, the crypto is still flailing. The report noted that CryptoQuant figures showed that Bitcoin perpetual futures (with no set expiry) have seen negative activity (funding rate cost for positions), where fast-money speculators usually engage in these contracts, showing low appetite. Meanwhile, in a blog post on August 19, Indian cryptocurrency exchange said they have recieved a \"clean chit\" from a forensic analysis conducted by Google subsidiary Mandiant Solutions. \"Weeks after WazirX was targeted by a cyberattack resulting in the theft of digital assets exceeding ( 2,000 crores) from one of their Multisig wallets, they have received a clean chit from Mandiant Solutions,\" the read. The cybersecurity firm was engaged to conduct a forensic analysis and determine whether any of the three laptops used by WazirX team members to perform transactions were compromised. In its report, Mandiant said, \u201cWe did not identify evidence of compromise on the three laptops that were used for signing transactions.\u201d The wallet that was attacked was managed using digital asset custody and wallet infrastructure. A spokesperson for WazirX said, \u201cWe have full faith in the investigating agency and shall cooperate with them to the fullest extent. We are actively working on recovering the stolen funds and are hopeful that those responsible will be brought to justice.\u201d In July, WazirX said it halted withdrawals from the platform after discovering that one of its multi-signature wallets had been . \u201cWe\u2019re aware that one of our multisig wallets has experienced a security breach. Our team is actively investigating the incident.

One of the top ten rivals to cryptocurrency Bitcoin, Toncoin suddenly fell, with prices crashing to around 20%, following Durov's arrest. The police arrested the Telegram CEO at Le Bourget airport for alleged offences related to his popular messaging app. France's OMFIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, has accused Durov of failing to take action to curb the criminal use of his platform, reported . Despite the 10th largest crypto asset trading at $5.69 as of 10:36 am Monday in Singapore, it remains down 16%, a drop traced to , according to data compiled by . Toncoin, previously known as Gram, is a native cryptocurrency of the TON network. As of August 26, 2024, Toncoin (TON) has a market cap of $14.39 billion, according to Coinbase. While Toncoin has said it is separate from Telegram, the ties between the two have transformed Telegram into one of crypto\u2019s most-hyped initiatives. In May 2024, Pantera Capital, an American investment agency, described its purchase of Toincoin as the firm\u2019s largest-ever investment. Telegram responded to its CEO's arrest on X on Monday, stating that Durov has \u201cnothing to hide.\u201d The messenger said it abides by EU laws and has nothing to hide, adding that it is \u201cabsurd\u201d to hold a platform accountable for abuse by users. It\u2019s \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d what impact Durov\u2019s detention will have on Telegram in the long term, said Richard Galvin, co-founder of hedge fund DACM, reported . In early 2023, DACM purchased TON tokens in a private round. Galvin further highlighted that the TON-Telegram relationship's biggest appeal was to drive base to crypto functionality. Amid such a backdrop, \u201canything that weakens the competitive position of Telegram is negative for TON,\u201d stated Galvin, reported Bloomberg. TON, on its X account, joined Elon Musk in expressing support for Durov, reposting the hashtags #FreePavel and #FREEDUROV and changing its logo to the \u201cResistance Dog\u201d, showing support. Telegram is ranked among the major social media platforms after Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok, and WeChat and aims to reach one billion users next year. Telegram, based in Dubai, was founded by . Forbes estimates Durov's worth at $15.5 billion. He left Russia in 2014 after refusing to comply with the government's demands to shut down opposition communities on the platform.",

The civil settlement with Robinhood is the first public action by Bonta's office against a cryptocurrency company. Bonta said violated California law by failing to deliver cryptocurrencies that its customers had bought, leaving customers unable to withdraw their assets and forcing them to sell the assets to exit the platform. The attorney general said Robinhood also misled customers about where their crypto assets were held, and by advertising it would connect customers to multiple trading venues to ensure they got competitive prices. Robinhood did not admit or deny wrongdoing. The settlement also requires the platform to let customers withdraw crypto assets to their own wallets, and honor its representations about its trading and order handling practices. Lucas Moskowitz, Robinhood's general counsel, in a statement said the Menlo Park, -based company was pleased to settle, and looked forward to making cryptocurrency \"more accessible and affordable to everyone.\" In a separate statement, Bonta said the settlement \"should send a strong message: whether you're a brick-and-mortar store or a cryptocurrency company, you must adhere to California's consumer and investor protection laws.\" Robinhood shares rose 12 cents to $19.23 in after-hours trading.",

        "Article Content": "Ganesh Chaturthi 2024: At a time when the Indian stock market is at record high levels, and there is a deluge of initial public offerings ( ) in the primary market, it could be an opportune time to increase exposure to as experts expect the yellow metal to hit the $3,000 mark next year in 2025. Gold is trading near $2,500, and experts predict several factors will drive bullion prices. These include aggressive by the US Federal Reserve, economic slowdowns in both the US and China, persistent inflation above the Fed's 2 per cent target, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and increased gold purchases by central banks. The solid inflow of money into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is another factor that Citi and Bank of America analysts believe could cause gold prices to hit $3,000 per ounce next year. Experts in India believe the biggest factor boosting gold prices is a rate cut by the US Fed. The market has priced in a 25 bps rate cut this month, but August's disappointing US jobs data has raised expectations that the overall size and extent of Fed cuts could be as much as 200 bps this year. This is a solid positive for gold prices. As Reuters reported, quoting Labor Department data, non-farm payrolls in the US rose by 1,42,000 in August, against the estimates of 1,60,000. July numbers were also revised down to 89,000. Ajay Garg, the director and CEO of , believes geopolitical premiums will also be on gold in 2025 due to the Ukraine war and tensions in the Middle East. Moreover, inflation is still a concern and is above the Fed target of 2 per cent. \"Gold is positively correlated to inflation, so prices should be higher. The recession feat and the US election will continue to add a premium to gold, and it can see $2,800-3,000 in 2025. Additionally, central banks are continuing to buy gold. The M2 supply is higher, and gold is likely to increase positively,\" said Garg. M2 measures the money supply, including cash, checking and savings deposits, money market securities, and other time deposits. According to Joseph Thomas, the head of research at Emkay Wealth, the general bullishness in the markets arises from the high probability of rate cuts in the US, further aided by the central banks' movement into gold and its safe-haven status. \"The rise in the value of gold by 25 per cent this calendar year itself is a reason for many to include gold progressively in their investment portfolios,\" said Thomas. Thomas underscored that gold's advance to $2,500 has been relatively steady without any meaningful price correction. \"The consistent demand for gold from central banks and the resultant rise in the composition of the gold component's forex reserves has created an impression that central banks are demanding gold in substitution of assets denominated in currencies like the US dollar. This gains further currency because the impending decline in US yields, as the Fed rate cut starts, is a certainty going by past trends,\" Thomas observed. Thomas pointed out that the prolonged period of high rates and high inflation could also result in a decline in economic growth, the signs of which are already visible in some of the numbers, especially development and employment. These factors support higher gold prices. However, Thomas added that the market is already pricing in some of these factors, which may restrict the rise to around $2,600 or somewhere close to that. Spot prices in India have gained 14 per cent this year so far, in sync with the equity benchmark Nifty 50 which is also up 14 per cent year-to-date (YTD). Gold prices have been driven by factors such as central bank buying, safe-haven demand due to escalating geopolitical tensions, rate cut hopes and exchange-traded fund (ETF) investments. However, Naveen Mathur, director of commodities and currencies at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, pointed out thatthe remarkable upward rally since last year has shown signs of deceleration since mid-April 2024, with China showing signs of exhaustion due to higher prices. Combined with a seasonally weaker month for global equities in September, this might lead to short-term pullbacks, up to 5 - 8 per cent in prices. However, this might also be offset by the fact that Indian physical purchases remain firm for the rest of the year, driven by lower prices due to import duty cuts seen in July, along with peak festive and wedding season demand that starts from October onwards, said Mathur. Mathur underscored that gold has always been the beneficiary of economic uncertainty, with interest rates in the US at multi-decade highs and growth concerns emerging. \"Historically, the US Fed has managed a soft landing only twice, following nine tightening cycles over the past five decades. The other seven had ended in a recession. Data from the World Gold Council suggest that previous recessions in the US started on average between five and 13 months after US Job growth reached the same level as last month, meaning negative growth could begin as early as the first quarter of next year,\" said Mathur. \"Strong investor confidence and underlying demand could drive gold prices to unprecedented levels in coming years, and even further 10 - 15 per cent returns in gold cannot be ruled out in 2025. We expect spot gold to average around $2,500 \u2013 2,560 per ounce in 2025, compared to the year-to-date average of $2,270 per ounce in 2024,\" Mathur said. Kaynat Chainwala, AVP of commodity research at Kotak Securities, believes gold prices will rise further in 2025, driven by expected aggressive rate cuts, increased central bank buying, and ongoing geopolitical tensions. \"Markets anticipate the Federal Reserve will implement 200 basis points of rate cuts by the end of 2025. Recent data from the World Gold Council highlights a significant increase in central bank gold purchases in July, reflecting their commitment to accumulating gold amid global uncertainty. Additionally, safe-haven demand fueled by persistent tensions in the Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine conflict may further boost gold prices,\" said Chainwala. Read all market-related news",

        "Article Content": "International have been on a broader downtrend and crashed nearly 20 per cent in the last 12 months due to a demand-supply imbalance in the market, even as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies eye price stability. Brent and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures logged the steepest year-to-date (YTD) crash last week after mixed US jobs data and a potential resolution of the Libya deal. Amid the price decline, the OPEC+ hike for two months after the benchmark Brent crude futures crashed to a 14-month low due to fragile demand and plentiful supply. OPEC nations will not proceed with the scheduled hike of 180,000 barrels per day (bpd) in October. -Commodity analysts said crude oil prices are weaker because of the current oil market conditions. They added that OPEC is 'artificially' curtailing oil production and losing its market share to maintain Brent above $80 per barrel. -''US is producing more crude oil than any nation at any time for the past six years in a row, according to EIA. US output was 13.1 mbpd in 2023, which is expected to further and this record is unlikely to be broken by any nation in the near term,'' Mohammed Imran, Research Analyst at Sharekhan Commodities by BNP Paribas told -According to experts, benchmark Brent crude futures is unlikely to touch the $100 mark until and unless there is an escalation of the Middle Eastern war turning into a full-blown war involving major producers in the region. -OPEC is likely to extend the curbs through the second half of this year and might start unwinding from early 2025. , with OPEC keeping a floor under prices,'' Kaynat Chainwala, AVP-Commodity Research of Kotak Securities told -US government data showed employment increased less than expected in August. Still, a drop in the jobless rate to 4.2 per cent suggested an orderly labor market slowdown that may not warrant a big interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve this month. Concerns around Chinese demand also kept pressuring oil prices. -Last Thursday, Brent settled at its lowest since June 2023 despite withdrawing from US oil inventories and OPEC+'s decision to delay planned oil output increases. US crude stockpiles fell by 6.9 million barrels to 418.3 million barrels last week, with a projected decline of 993,000. -Signals that Libya's rival factions could be closer to an agreement to end the dispute that has halted the country's crude exports also pressured oil prices this week. Exports remained mostly shut in, but some loadings were permitted from storage. -Bank of America lowered its Brent price forecast for the second half of 2024 to $75 a barrel from almost $90 previously, it said in a note on Friday, citing building global inventories, weaker demand growth and OPEC+ spare production capacity. The US active oil rig count, an early indicator of future output, remained unchanged at 483 this week, said energy services firm Baker Hughes. Crude oil prices settled two per cent lower in the previous session, with a big weekly loss after data US jobs data was weaker than expected in August, which outweighed price support from a delay to supply increases by OPEC+ producers. Brent crude futures were down $1.63, or 2.24 per cent, to $71.06 a barrel, their lowest level since Dec. 2021. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell $1.48, or 2.14 per cent, to $67.67, their lowest since June 2023. For the week, Brent declined 10 per cent, while WTI dropped around eight per cent. Back home, crude oil futures last settled 0.07 per cent lower at 5,700 per barrel on the multi commodity exchange (MCX). OPEC says its member states' exports account for about 49 per cent of global crude exports. OPEC estimates that its member countries hold about 80 per cent of the world's proven oil reserves. Because of its large market share, OPEC's decisions can affect global oil prices. OPEC+ members meet regularly to decide how much oil to sell on global markets. Commodity analysts say oil prices continue to see high volatility but have remained under selling pressure overall amid further signs of a deteriorating global economic outlook, leading to sluggish demand (especially from China). \"Downside looks limited amid support from bigger than expected drawdown in oil inventories and OPEC+ member\u2019s decision to continue with their additional output cuts. On charts... prices hold support at 5,800/ 5,720, while on the upside resistance is seen at 6,030/ 6,150,\u201d said Pranav Mer, Vice President, EBG - Commodity & Currency Research, JM Financial Services Ltd.",

        "Article Content": "Gold price today: moved up in the domestic futures market Monday morning, but the gains remained capped as investors awaited numbers to get further cues on the magnitude of the rate cut this month. After weaker jobs number, investors' focus is now on the August US Consumer Price Index (CPI), due on Wednesday, followed by the Producer Price Index (PPI) on Thursday, to gauge the size and extent of the US Fed rate cut cycle which is expected to start September 18. In the international markets, gold prices were subdued as investors restricted their bets ahead of key macro numbers. While rate cuts are positive for gold prices, experts believe the market has already discounted a 25 bps rate cut, which may not give a major boost to yellow metal prices. According to a Reuters report quoting the CME FedWatch Tool, Fed funds futures traders are now pricing a 69 per cent chance of a 25-basis-point cut and a 31 per cent chance of a 50 bp reduction at the Fed's September 17-18 meeting. MCX Gold traded 0.20 per cent up at 71,565 per 10 grams around 9:20 am. Gold prices witnessed very high volatility last week and plunged amid mixed US economic data, ahead of the US CPI inflation data this week. Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research expects gold prices to remain volatile this week amid volatility in the dollar index, volatility in the global financial markets and ahead of the US inflation data and expects it to hold its support level of $2,464 per troy ounce on a weekly closing basis. \"Gold has support at $2,510-2,488, while resistance is at $2,544-2,558 per troy ounce in today\u2019s session. On the MCX, gold has support at 71,180-70,850 and resistance at 71,770-72,040. We suggest staying away from gold and silver in today's session due to the high volatility in global financial markets,\" said Jain. According to Aiyub Yacoobali, Chairman and Managing Director of South Gujarat Shares And Sharebrokers, with a weak dollar index, volatility remains at a peak in MCX Gold. \"Trading above 72,350 will see further upward momentum for a possible upward range of 73,508 \u2013 73,828.

        "Article Content": "Gold rate today: traded flat with negative bias in early trade in the domestic futures market on Tuesday, September 10, mirroring lacklustre global sentiment. A rise in the US dollar and caution ahead of the US inflation data on Wednesday weighed on gold prices. The dollar rose to its one-week high level, putting pressure on gold prices. The dollar's rise is negative for gold prices since the yellow metal is priced in dollars. When the dollar's value rises, gold becomes expensive in other currencies, eroding its safe-haven appeal. The US Federal Reserve's upcoming on September 17-18 is the biggest near-term trigger for gold. Experts point out that the market has discounted a 25 bps rate cut this time, and it may not boost gold prices. However, if the decides to go for a bigger cut of about 50 bps, it will trigger gold prices. Investors await the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Wednesday and the Producer Price Index (PPI) prints on Thursday. According to a Reuters poll, the US headline CPI is expected to have risen 0.2 per cent month-on-month in August, unchanged from July. MCX Gold for October 4 delivery traded 0.07 per cent lower at 71,580 per 10 grams around 9:20 am. Gold prices are expected to remain volatile ahead of the US inflation data. Experts also observe that the yellow metal may see a directional movement only after the US Fed policy decision next week. Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research expects gold and silver prices to remain volatile this week amid volatility in the dollar index and the global financial markets ahead of the US inflation data. However, he expects the precious metals to hold their support levels of $2,464 and $26.80 per troy ounce on a weekly closing basis. \"Gold has support at $2,518-2,500, while resistance at $2,550-2,568 per troy ounce and silver has support at $28.34-28, while resistance is at $29-29.40 per troy ounce in today\u2019s session,\" said Jain. \"On the MCX, gold has support at 71,350-71,100 and resistance at 71,850-72,080, while silver has support at 83,000-82,250 and resistance at 84,400-85,100,\" said Jain. Jain suggests buying gold on dips around 71,350, with a stop loss of 71,080 and a target of 71,850. According to brokerage firm SMC Global Securities, gold may trade in the range of 71,300-71,800, and silver may trade in the range of 83,100-83,900, with sideways to mixed bias. Aiyub Yacoobali, Chairman and Managing Director of South Gujarat Shares And Sharebrokers and Yacoobali Venture Commodity Broking Private Limited, pointed out that with rising dollar index, MCX Gold is unable to cross resistance zone of 72,349. It registered high of 72,235 and witnessed profit booking. \"On the downside, 71,174 \u2013 70,736 will act as a major support zone. Fresh supply is possible only below this zone. On the other hand, a fresh upward momentum is possible only if MCX Gold manages to trade above the 72,349 level. As of now, MCX Gold is trading in time correction. Violation of support and resistance zones will lead to fresh momentum,\" said Yacoobali. Read all market-related news",

        "Article Content": "International crude oil prices crashed to a 33-month low (near a three-year low) on Tuesday, September 10, with the sinking below $70 a barrel for the first time since December 2021. This came shortly after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) slashed its global oil demand forecast for this year and 2025. Brent crude futures were last down $2.33, or 3.24 per cent, at $69.51 a barrel. US West Texas Intermediate crude lost $2.50, or 3.64 per cent, to $66.21. On Monday, both . Back home, crude oil futures last traded 4.19 per cent lower at 5,534 per barrel on the multi-commodity exchange (MCX). -On Tuesday, OPEC said in its monthly report that the world oil demand will rise by 2.03 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, down from last month's forecast for growth of 2.11 million bpd. Until last month, OPEC had kept the forecast unchanged since it was first made in July 2023. OPEC also cut its 2025 global demand growth estimate to 1.74 million bpd from 1.78 million bpd. -Oil prices dipped on weakening global demand prospects and expectations of oil oversupply with the Libya deal and group output. The bearish rut to add 180,000 bpd next month as it gradually restarts output that has been halted since 2022 in a bid to shore up prices. -On Monday, Chinese data showed consumer inflation accelerated in August to its fastest in half a year, though domestic demand remained fragile, and producer price deflation worsened. Data released on Tuesday showed China's exports grew in August at their fastest in nearly 1 1/2 years, yet imports disappointed, with domestic demand depressed. -Analysts said OPEC cannot cut enough to offset the US and Brazilian positions and some other reservoirs at work. The US National Hurricane Center said tropical Storm Francine barrelled across the Gulf of Mexico and was on track to become a hurricane on Tuesday. -Exxon Mobil, Shell and Chevron removed offshore staff and . Exxon cut production at its Hoover oil facility about 150 miles east of Corpus Christi, Texas. -Oil major Chevron withdrew workers from four offshore facilities and halted oil and gas output at two. Shell cut production at one platform, moved workers off three facilities and paused drilling at two. Analysts said the production shut-ins have failed to offset weak demand sentiment. -There is a wide split in 2024 demand growth forecasts due to differences over China and the pace of the world's transition to cleaner fuels. OPEC is still at the top of industry estimates and has a long way to go to match the International Energy Agency (IEA)'s far lower view. -OPEC said this year's demand growth was still above the historical average of 1.4 million bpd seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, which caused a plunge in oil use. OPEC has implemented a series of output cuts since late 2022 to support the market, most of which are in place until the end of 2025. -The report showed that actual production fell in August mainly due to unrest in Libya disrupting output. OPEC pumped 40.66 million bpd in August, down 304,000 bpd from July, led by a decline in Libya. The OPEC report projects demand for OPEC crude, or crude from OPEC plus the allied countries working with it, at 43.8 million bpd in the fourth quarter, allowing the group to theoretically increase production. -Other forecasts give less room for OPEC oil. The IEA, representing industrialised countries, sees much lower demand growth than OPEC of 970,000 bpd in 2024. The IEA is scheduled to update its figures on Thursday. According to Pranav Mer, Vice President, EBG - Commodity & Currency Research, JM Financial Services Ltd, oil price continues to see high volatility but overall have remained under selling pressure amid further signs of a deteriorating global economic outlook leading to sluggish demand (especially from China). \u2018\u2019On charts... prices hold support at 5,800/ 5,720, while on the upside resistance is seen at 6,030/ 6,150,'' said Mer. \u2018\u2019According to the US EIA, the Gulf Coast accounts for 50 per cent of the country's refining capacity, and if the storm escalates into a hurricane, it could disrupt production temporarily. However, the strengthening dollar index and concerns over Chinese demand capped crude oil's gains. Crude oil has support at $67.50\u201367.00 and resistance at $68.70\u201369.40.

        "Article Content": "are hovering at a 33-month low of $70 per barrel due to recent global developments, which have led to ample supplies amid weaker demand prospects. The global sell-off in crude oil compelled the producer group Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) to for two months. Last week, reports of resolving a dispute that had halted Libyan crude supply led to Brent futures falling to ~$71/bbl. According to domestic brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher, the marginal cost of production at fag end of the cost curve is upwards of $70/bbl. Hence, D-Street analysts expect that global crude oil prices will not remain below $70/bbl marl for long. \u2018\u2019While upstream earnings are currently impacted, with OPEC+ delaying its planned rise in production, we expect oil prices to rebound to $75-80/bbl in the near term. Thus, net oil realization should return to ~$75/bbl. APM price is set to rise in FY26E, and gas produced from new wells will attract premium pricing. These bode well for upstream players,'' said experts at Prabhudas Lilladher. In response to the lower oil prices, OPEC+ decided to postpone its planned increase in oil production by at least two months. \u201cThus, we expect crude oil prices to reach $75-80/bbl levels again. While upstream companies\u2019 net oil realization has fallen from ~$75/bbl, we do not anticipate this to continue for long,\u201d said the domestic brokerage. Gas produced from new wells will see a 20 per cent premium over the APM price, which is determined monthly at 10 per cent of the imported Indian crude basket and capped at $6.5/mmBtu. Consequently, incremental gas produced by ONGC and Oil India will benefit from better realization. \u2018\u2019The APM ceiling price is set to be revised to $6.75/mmBtu from FY26. Thus, gas realization looks to be rising for upstream companies,\" said analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher. OPEC+ pumps around 40 per cent of the world's crude and its policy decisions can have a major impact on oil prices. Indian oil marketing companies (OMCs) usually witness an uptrend in their stock prices when international crude oil prices trade lower. On the other hand, high crude rates result in inflation and a higher import bill for India, which is a net importer of crude oil. Domestic brokerages say state-owned Oil India and are the most favourably placed to reap results due to dividend play and attractive valuations when Brent crude futures are at the $80/bbl mark. For ONGC, the brokerage has built-in 3.4 percent and 7.2 per cent CAGR volume growth in oil and gas production over FY24-26E to 22.6 MMT and 23.7 cm, respectively. For Oil India, it has built-in eight per cent and 16 per cent CAGR volume growth in oil and gas production over FY24-26E to 3.9mmt and 4.3bcm, respectively. ONGC expects its capital expenditure (capex) to be in the range of 33,000- 35,000 crore for the current fiscal (FY25). ONGC's capex for FY24 came at 37,000 crore. ONGC accounts for about two-thirds of India\u2019s oil and more than 50 per cent. \u2018\u2019We upgrade our rating on ONGC from \u2018Hold\u2019 to \u2018Accumulate\u2019 with a target price (TP) of 329 based on 9x FY26 adj EPS and adding the value of investments. We maintain \u2018Buy\u2019 on Oil India with a TP of 786 based on 12x FY26 adj EPS and adding the value of investments,'' said Prabhudas Lilladher. Morgan Stanley cut its Brent crude oil forecasts for coming quarters and said the global oil market is facing a period of demand weakness similar to those seen during recessions. The bank said rising fuel inventories, lower refining margins, and the spreads between the current price and future estimates echo previous recessionary periods or other moments of weak demand. Those include the periods of falling demand in 2007-2008 due to the financial crisis and in 2020 due to the onset of COVID, the investment bank said. There are also parallels with non-recessionary periods of lacklustre demand and higher supply in 2013 and in 1992-1993, said the bank. The bank explored the possibility of oil prices acting as a recessionary indicator. Still, it concluded that it was too early and acknowledged that the market was pricing in a substantial deterioration in the balance of supply and demand. Seasonal demand strength usually subsides after summer, and supply from both OPEC and non-OPEC sources is likely to re-accelerate in the fourth quarter and 2025, leading to a shift in the supply and demand balance, the bank said. However, the OPEC+ focused on balancing the market, as evidenced by its decision to delay output increases that were due to start in October. Morgan Stanley expects oil markets to remain tight in the third quarter, move closer to balance in the fourth quarter, and show a surplus of one million barrels per day in 2025. The bank cut its Brent price forecast for the fourth quarter of 2024 by $5 per barrel to $75, a level it now sees for all quarters next year. It had previously been forecasting Brent to average $78 in the first quarter of 2025 and to decline steadily throughout the year to $75 in the fourth. \"Although rising OPEC output is a key factor behind the surplus we model for 2025, we would be hesitant to argue that this justifies the recent price decline,\" it said, adding that the market appears modestly oversold in the short term. It added that Brent will likely remain anchored around the mid-$70s if demand weakens more.",

        "Article Content": "slightly recovered from a 33-month low level and climbed three per cent or over $2 a barrel on Wednesday, September 11, driven by fears of lengthy production shutdowns in the offshore oil patch due to Hurricane Francine. The recovery in prices also came after an increase in US crude inventories reported earlier today, while Brent crude futures were last up $1.87, or 2.70 per cent, to $71.06 a barrel and the US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures last gained $2.05, or 3.12 per cent, to $67.80. Back home, crude oil futures last traded 2.91 per cent higher at 5,694 per barrel on the multi-commodity exchange (MCX). -Crude oil prices shook off an increase in crude inventories reported by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). The EIA said crude inventories rose by 833,000 to 419.1 million barrels in the week ending September 6, lower than analysts' expectations. -Analysts said EIA data show Cushing inventories have drawn nine of the last ten weeks, down to the lowest level since early November last year. Concern about Hurricane Francine disrupting output in the US, the world's biggest producer, also supported prices. -Both oil benchmarks tanked on Tuesday, with and US crude dropping to its lowest since May 2023 after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) revised its 2024 oil demand growth forecast for a second time. -OPEC said in its monthly report that the world oil demand will rise by 2.03 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, down from last month's forecast for growth of 2.11 million bpd. Until last month, OPEC had kept the forecast unchanged since it was first made in July 2023. -Analysts said the market rebounded autonomously, as Tuesday's drop was substantial, citing fears that Hurricane Francine would disrupt supply. The US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said on Tuesday that about 24 per cent of crude production and 26 per cent of natural gas output in the US Gulf of Mexico were offline due to the storm. -Oil prices have lately dipped on weakening global demand prospects and expectations of oil oversupply with the Libya deal and group output. The bearish rut comes despite the OPEC alliance postponing its original plan to add 180,000 bpd next month as it gradually restarts output that has been halted since 2022 to shore up prices. -D-Street analysts expect that global crude oil prices will not remain below $70/bbl marl for long. Morgan Stanley cut its Brent crude oil forecasts for coming quarters and said the global oil market is facing a period of demand weakness similar to those seen during recessions. Analysts said Chinese demand growth was also revised downwards to 650,000 barrels per day, compared to 700,000 barrels per day in the previous report. A tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico and a decline in US oil stocks could support crude oil prices at lower levels. \u2018\u2019We anticipate continued volatility in crude oil prices. Crude oil is expected to find support at $64.90-64.40, with resistance around $66.20-66.80. In INR terms, crude oil has support at 5,450-5,400, while resistance is at 5,600-5,660,'' said Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities Ltd. Commenting on crude price forecast, Swarnendu Bhushan, Co-head of Institutional Equities, PL Capital- Prabhudas Lilladher said, \u2018\u2019While upstream earnings are currently impacted, with the OPEC+ delaying its planned rise in production, we expect oil prices to rebound to $75-80/bbl in the near term.''",

        "Article Content": "traded lacklustre in the early deals in the domestic futures market Thursday morning after the prints poured cold water on hopes of a 50 bps rate cut by the US Fed. In international markets, gold prices traded flat after the US consumer prices data release. Traders have shifted their focus towards the US Producer Price Index data and initial jobless claims data, which are due later today. The recent macro data are expected to influence the US Fed's on September 18. The US consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.2 per cent last month, matching the advance in July. However, core inflation climbed 0.3 per cent, rising from July's 0.2 per cent increase. \"While headline CPI met expectations at 0.2 per cent month-on-month and was up 2.5 per cent year-on-year, core CPI was higher than expected (0.3 per cent month-on-month versus 0.2 per cent expected) and was up 3.2 per cent year-on-year. The market pricing in a 50bps cut in September cut has virtually been erased. However, the market is still pricing at least 100bps of cuts in total by end-2024. With this being a cautious and data-driven Fed, a 25bps cut is now virtually locked in for next week,\" said Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services. The US dollar rose after the US inflation data showed signs of stickiness and dimmed the prospects of a deeper rate cut. This weighed on gold prices. MCX Gold traded 0.03 per cent up at 71,950 per 10 grams around 9:30 am. Experts expect gold prices to witness volatility this week, reacting to the US macro numbers, the dollar's movement and speculations regarding the US Fed. They say MCX Gold is witnessing time correction, and the violation of the support and resistance zone will lead to fresh momentum. According to Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research, gold and silver prices may remain volatile this week. However, he expects them to hold their support level of $2,464 and $26.80 per troy ounce, respectively, on a weekly closing basis. \"Gold has support at $2,522-2,510, while resistance at $2,558-2,572 per troy ounce and silver has support at $28.60-28.34, while resistance is at $29.24-29.55 per troy ounce in today\u2019s session,\" said Jain. \"On the MCX, gold has support at 71,700-71,440 and resistance at 72,200-72,500, while silver has support at 83,800-83,100 and resistance at 85,200-86,000. We suggest buying gold on dips around 71,650 with a stop loss of 71,400 for the target of 72,200,\" Jain said. Aiyub Yacoobali, Chairman and Managing Director of South Gujarat Shares And Sharebrokers, observed that MCX Gold is enjoying a time correction with the dollar index. \"Volatility in the dollar index is reducing; hence, MCX Gold is witnessing rangebound sessions. On the downside, 71,174 \u2013 70,736 will be a major support zone. Fresh supply is possible only below this zone. Fresh upward momentum is possible only if MCX Gold trades above 72,062 \u2013 72,349 zone,\" said Yacoobali. Rahul Kalantri, VP of commodities at Mehta Equities, pointed out that the ECB is holding a monetary policy meeting today, and potential interest rate cuts could further support gold and silver prices. \"Gold is finding support at $2,495\u20132,480, with resistance at $2,530\u20132,542. Silver has support at $28.35\u201328.10, while resistance is at $28.82\u201328.98. In INR terms, gold has support at 71,710\u201371,550, with resistance at 72,100\u201372,250.

        "Article Content": "witnessed significant gains in the morning trade in the domestic futures market on Friday, September 13, tracking positive global cues and weakness in the US dollar. Comex gold jumped to record highs of $2,598.30 per troy ounce as the dollar fell to a one-week low amid optimism for a interest rate cut next week. Interest rate cuts and a weak US dollar are both positive triggers for gold prices. Since gold is priced in dollars internationally, when the value of the US currency falls, gold becomes cheaper for buyers in other currencies. This increases global demand for gold and pushes its price higher. On the other hand, when the US Federal Reserve reduces interest rates, it affects the returns of interest-bearing assets like bonds and savings accounts. While gold is not an interest-bearing asset, the opportunity cost of holding gold declines due to Fed rate cuts, which increases the demand for yellow metals and, ultimately, price. Investors' focus is now on the next week's US Federal Reserve meeting on September 18. The recent macroeconomic prints have indicated some weakness in the US economy while has eased. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut rates for the second time this year on Thursday by 25 bps and lowered its 2024 growth forecast to 0.8 per cent from an earlier projection of 0.9 per cent. MCX Gold traded 0.51 per cent higher at 73,194 per 10 grams around 9:45 am. Experts appear largely positive about the gold's prospects for today's session. Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research expects gold and silver prices to trade with positive bias today amid weakness in the dollar index and a rebound in crude oil prices. \"Gold has support at $2,558-2,544, while resistance at $2,600-2,622 per troy ounce and silver has support at $29.74-29.40, while resistance is at $30.44-30.74 per troy ounce in today\u2019s session,\" said Jain. \"On the MCX, gold has support at 72,550-72,270 and resistance at 73,050-73,300, while silver has support at 86,300-85,500 and resistance at 87,750-88,400,\" Jain said. Jain suggests buying gold on dips around 72,550 with a stop loss of 72,250 for the target of 73,100. Rahul Kalantri, VP of commodities at Mehta Equities, underscored that the recent US inflation and jobless claims data suggest the Fed may implement larger rate cuts in future policy meetings, which could further support gold and silver prices. \"Gold currently has support at $2,530-$2,510, with resistance at $2,572-$2,585. Silver has support at $29.65-$29.40 and resistance at $30.20-$30.50. In INR terms, gold is supported at 72,610- 72,450, with resistance at 72,990- 73,250. Silver has support at 86,370- 85,750, while resistance is at 87,850- 88,550,\" said Kalantri. According to brokerage firm SMC Global Securities, gold may trade in the range of 72,700-73,200, and silver may trade in the range of 86,700-87,900, with sideways to bullish bias.

        "Article Content": "Jewellery stocks soared in Friday's trading as gold hit new record highs amid global central banks initiating interest rate cuts in response to easing inflation. The US Federal Reserve is also expected to lower its benchmark rates next week, further fueling the rise in gold prices. Shares of Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri (TBZ), Kalyan Jewellers, Senco Gold, Motisons Jewellers, PC Jeweller, and Thangamayil Jewellery all experienced gains ranging from 4 percent to 18.5 percent. For regional jewellery companies, increasing gold prices can be advantageous. These companies typically leave a larger portion of their gold inventory unhedged, allowing them to directly profit from any rise in gold prices through inventory gains. In contrast, larger jewellery firms such as Titan and Kalyan Jewellers hedge from 70 percent to 90 percent of their gold. While these companies hedge a significant portion of their gold, the unhedged portion of their inventory also benefits from rising gold prices. Overall, jewellery stocks have performed well recently, bolstered by several factors: reductions in customs duties on gold and silver announced in the recent Union Budget, rising demand for wedding jewellery, positive brokerage recommendations, and expectations of strong demand during the upcoming festive season. Gold prices surged by 2 percent on Thursday after the European Central Bank (ECB) cut rates by 25 basis points, as anticipated. The ECB's decision reflects growing confidence among policymakers that inflation is easing. This marks the ECB's second rate cut, following the one in June. Expectations of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve have increased. Recent data, including higher initial jobless claims and weaker August payrolls, indicate a cooling labour market. Meanwhile, US producer prices rose slightly more than expected in August due to higher service costs, but overall trends show easing inflation. US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently supported the notion of imminent rate cuts, citing concerns about a weakening labour market. Currently, markets foresee a 59 percent probability of a 25 basis point cut and a 41 percent chance of a 50 basis point reduction, according to the CME FedWatch tool. S . Gold has outperformed all other asset classes in 2024, providing substantial returns while maintaining its physical appeal. At the beginning of 2024, spot gold was trading at $2,062 per ounce. It has since risen 24.5 percent to $2,567 per ounce. The Nifty 50 has jumped 16 percent over the same period. Even before central banks announced rate cuts, gold prices had already been rising. substantial purchases by major central banks such as those in China and India, escalating geopolitical tensions, ongoing trade wars between global superpowers, and strong retail demand for gold. Global central banks, particularly in Asia, have been actively diversifying their foreign exchange reserves away from the US dollar. and significantly increasing its gold purchases. Gold prices typically react positively to lower interest rates or the expectation of rate cuts by global banks because lower interest rates diminish the returns on interest-bearing assets like bonds and savings accounts. This makes gold, which does not yield interest or dividends, more appealing because the opportunity cost of holding gold decreases. Lower interest rates can also signal or contribute to higher inflation, prompting investors to turn to gold as a hedge. Gold is traditionally viewed as a store of value that helps preserve purchasing power. Moreover, interest rate cuts often weaken a country\u2019s currency, reducing its value relative to other currencies. Gold becomes cheaper for investors holding other currencies when the US dollar weakens, boosting demand. As interest rates fall, investors may seek assets with higher potential returns, like gold, leading to increased investment demand and rising gold prices. Furthermore, central bank rate cuts often signal a more accommodative monetary policy, improving investor sentiment and increasing the buying of gold, which is considered a safe haven during uncertain economic times. :",

        "Article Content": "Trinamool Congress (TMC) Member of Parliament Mahua Moitra has lodged a formal complaint with the Lokpal against Madhabi Puri Buch, the current chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The complaint, filed on September 11, accuses Buch of improper conduct and engaging in quid pro quo arrangements that allegedly threaten India's national interests. Moitra took to social media platform X to announce her action, stating, \"My LokPal complaint against Ms. Puri-Buch been filed electronically & in physical form. LokPal must within 30 days refer it to CBI/ED for a preliminary investigation and then a full FIR enquiry. Every single entity involved needs to be summoned & every link investigated [sic].\" In her complaint, Moitra labels Buch as a \u201cserial offender\u201d and alleges impropriety during her tenure as a public servant. The complaint references Buch's appointment as a whole-time member of SEBI from April 2017 to October 2021 and her subsequent elevation to chairperson in March 2022. The TMC MP's complaint cites allegations made by Hindenburg Research, a US-based firm, on August 10, 2024. These allegations question handling of investigations into the 's offshore shareholders and suggest potential conflicts of interest. This complaint follows recent criticisms from other political figures. On September 10, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of compromising 's integrity to protect his allies. Earlier, on September 2, Congress spokesperson raised questions about Buch's financial dealings, claiming she received substantial income from ICICI Bank between 2017 and 2024. The controversy intensified last month when alleged that Buch and her husband had stakes in offshore entities linked to the Adani Group. In response, the couple issued a joint statement strongly denying these allegations, calling them \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cdevoid of any truth.\u201d They expressed that they have disclosed all their financial documents to relevant authorities.",

        "Article Content": "Smallcap and midcap stocks are likely to be the bigger beneficiaries of interest rate easing cycle and investors\u2019 interest in this space may rise as earnings growth comes back, says Jitendra Sriram, Senior Fund Manager, Baroda BNP Paribas Mutual Fund. In an interview with , Sriram said he expects Nifty 50 to deliver low-teen returns from a one year perspective. Sriram shares his views on the resilience of Indian markets, key growth triggers and sectoral opportunities, and also discusses the building front in the SME IPO market. Here are edited excerpts: India has been a haven for growth in a global environment where growth is faltering across the European Union (EU), the US, and China. This has been one key reason why we are witnessing India eliciting investor interest. With growth rates likely to remain around the 7% mark, this is a powerful long-term propellant for Indian markets. In addition, over the medium term, the cost of capital dynamics is also playing well for India. , coupled with the government targeting a steady lowering of the fiscal deficit, means that sovereign borrowing costs should head southwards. This would make the cost of capital dynamics incrementally positive. In the short term, a normal monsoon and certain favourable tax treatment on up to September 30, 2024, are added triggers. From a structure perspective, the rising share of domestic money arising from SIPs, retiral savings, etc., means that there is now a meaningful counterweight to foreign flows, which should reduce the volatility for Indian markets. Valuation always needs to be seen in the context of growth and costs of capital. As mentioned earlier, growth has been resilient, and there are some potential triggers for a downward bias on the cost of capital. may be marginally higher than historical averages, but given the growth rates and the potential lower cost of capital ahead, we are not unduly worried. There are definitely certain pockets of exuberance in some areas of the market, but an active fund weighing the risk-return trade-off should be able to navigate these. From a risk perspective, geopolitics remains the big risk which could take the shape of either logistics disruptions, supply chain disruptions or spikes in crude prices. There is now way to predict this and one needs to wait and react to such events. Other than this, electoral cycles \u2013 one in the US and the second locally in the states of India could cause some volatility for markets. In our view, the commencement of a US rate easing cycle can lead to a pickup in discretionary spending, improving the outlook for the IT sector. A weak dollar also has ramifications for the commodity sectors (energy, metals etc). India is also nearing an inflection on its rate trajectory, and this could have a positive rub-off on parts of the BFSI space, such as NBFCs. Certain thematics such as quick commerce, tariff revisions in telecom, the bio-secure act in the US for pharma are positive. Certain performing sectors of the recent past, such as industrials or utilities, may need to deliver on their backlogs as the focus is now increasingly on execution rather than order wins. Commodity chemicals may be another area where Chinese supplies are playing truant. In our view, the large-cap space is fairly reasonable, while the SMID (small and mid-cap) space may undergo either a time correction for earnings to catch up or a price correction to adjust for slower earnings in 1H. Electoral dynamics have led to lower government spending in 1H, which should pick up in 2H, leading to some perk-up/acceleration in earnings. From a near-term perspective, over the next 1-2 quarters, we prefer the large-cap space. As earnings come back on track for the SMID segments, interest levels should also be back up for this space. Investors looking beyond a quarter can surely take a look at these segments. Also, the leverage for the SMID space is usually higher, and they would be bigger beneficiaries of a rate-easing cycle as it gets underway. A general thumb rule has usually been that a soft dollar is usually better for flows to emerging markets, India is no exception. As the US moves into its rate easing, we expect trade to play itself out. India may be marginally more expensive than its peers in emerging markets, but its growth is also stronger. Further, India has a wide variety of sectors on offer compared to most EM\u2019s, which are either commodity-heavy or heavily skewed towards certain sectors such as foundries in Taiwan. We expect the foreign flow to remain buoyant in the hunt for growth, but one must realise that just as Indian money is changing colour (emergence of NPS, provident funds, etc.), foreign money is also changing colour with more private equity, venture funds, etc. at play as compared to a decade back. We have always evaluated each IPO on its individual merits and typically our subscription rate would be 1 out of 4-5 s. None of our funds invest in the segment but to answer your question, there does appear to be some froth in the space which even the regulator has been raising voices on. We would advise investors to do their due diligence prior to investing in such areas rather than follow a herd instinct like the Pied piper of Hamelin. This is a difficult question to answer. Investors' risk appetite and need for cash at points in time are varied, and it is not a case of one solution that suits all. In our view a financial planner with a line of sight on such requirements is better placed to advise on this. From a risk management perspective, we believe that within equity, one should have a mix of low volatility products like a large cap or a consumption product blended with a combination of higher volatility (mid and small cap and thematics) for better risk-adjusted return. The proportion will vary with age, investment needs, etc. From a one-year standpoint, we believe that the should be able to deliver a low teen return from here. This is based on the current anticipated earnings growth. India is a structural growth story. A combination of favourable demographics, conducive government policies (Make in India, Aatmanirbhar Bharat, PLI schemes etc) and a structural longer-term move to a lower cost of capital augurs well for our markets. Do remember, markets are never linear, and you will have volatilities arising from crude price movements, global events, vagaries of monsoons, etc, but in the longer term, the markets are great compounders.",

        "Article Content": "The recent sharp market run-up has made many expensive, creating a challenge for investors seeking new buying opportunities. This situation presents a dilemma: selling existing becomes difficult due to the absence of clear resistance levels, while buying feels risky with stocks potentially overvalued fundamentally and technically overstretched. To navigate this market climate, we've identified three stocks that offer both attractive and strong upside potential based on technical analysis. Our picks have a short- to medium-term focus (3 to 6 months). Investors can conduct their own fundamental research to potentially extend their investment horizon and capitalise on a larger price move. , one of the fastest-growing mid-cap banks, has lagged the banking sector due to factors like a high cost-to-income ratio, sluggish core income growth, asset quality concerns, negative market sentiment, and analyst downgrades. The recent floods in further dampened sentiment, leading to increased provisioning needs. However, at the current price, the negatives seem priced in, limiting the downside risk. Technically, the stock is trading near its monthly support level of 69-70. This level previously acted as strong resistance, which was broken in May 2023. Following the principle of polarity, this broken resistance can now become a significant support zone. On the weekly chart, the price remains below the 20-week EMA. However, considering the stock's proximity to longer-term support levels, a reversal is anticipated. A good buying could be in the range of 64-52, which coincides with the quarterly mean and represents a lower entry point. Alternatively, a move and close above the 20-week EMA on the weekly chart could also signal an entry opportunity, potentially leading to a channel breakout as depicted in the accompanying chart. has undergone a prolonged consolidation phase. Throughout 2023, the stock built a strong base and has recently broken out of an ascending triangle pattern. The significant volume accompanying this breakout reinforces the conviction in this bullish move, suggesting the stock is poised for further from current levels. The stock can be considered around the current price with a minimum upside potential of 25-30% in the short term. HDFC Life has enjoyed a recent rally. Despite this uptick, the valuations remain reasonable, offering further upside potential. The stock is trading close to its all-time highs, and recent suggests a potential imminent breakout. Several factors support the stock's momentum, including robust Q1 FY2025 results, a favorable industry outlook, positive regulatory developments (new surrender norms), and strong demographics within the Indian market. Technically, the stock is gaining momentum and appears on the verge of breaking out of an inverse head and shoulders formation. This bullish pattern typically projects a target price equivalent to the height of the inverse head and shoulders. In HDFC Life's case, the short- to medium-term target could be in the range of 920-950. The last stock on our radar is Page Inds. Page Inds has posted its best Q1 revenue growth in seven quarters & that has clearly reflected on the stock price. Several brokerage houses have upgraded the stock considering the bright prospects in the near future. Effective cost control & operational efficiencies have enhanced profitability. The company has also seen a surge in demand for its premium innerwear & athleisure segments bolstering revenue. Valuations of Page inds are reasonably good considering the near term growth prospects. Technically Page Inds has shown strong signs of reversal. The stock has been in a weekly downtrend since the beginning of 2023, but has now shown break of lower highs and lower lows on the weekly chart. On daily time frame one can observe a golden crossover in the stock around 38000 levels. A golden crossover happens when a 50 Day moving average crosses over a 200 Day moving average. It is a signal of a long term trend reversal. With no major near-term resistance levels in sight the stock looks set for the target levels of 50- 52000 in the medium term. One can look to accumulate the stock around current price & also use every dip as a potential buying opportunity Page Inds showing golden crossover & a strong upward momentum.",

        "Article Content": "The fiscal year has been marked by significant market volatility, particularly after major events such as the results and the hawkish monetary policy changes by the Bank of Japan. According to PGIM India Mutual Fund, the Nifty 50 Index experienced sharp corrections, dropping more than 2 per cent on specific days due to these events. However, despite these initial dips, the rebounded quickly, hitting new all-time highs. Beneath this recovery, investor preferences have shifted, with high-growth, high-quality companies regaining favour, observed PGIM in a recent report. The report informed that historically, the market has rewarded companies with high sales growth and strong returns on equity (RoE). As of September 9, 2024, high-growth delivered median returns of 32 per cent CAGR over the last five years, compared to the NSE 500's 25 per cent. However, FY24 saw a reversal of this trend, with companies showing lower growth and RoE outperforming their high-growth peers by 35 per cent from April 2023 to May 2024. Following the June 2024 union election results, high-growth companies made a comeback, outperforming lower-growth firms by around 10 per cent, noted the report. PGIM identified several factors driving this change. One key reason is the shift in interest rate expectations from global central banks, led by the and the European Central Bank. Indian interest rates have largely followed the Fed's moves, and rates are expected to decline over the next year, providing a supportive environment for high-growth companies. Another factor contributing to this shift is earnings performance. Research from Ambit Capital indicated that Q1 FY25 was relatively weak, with the showing a negative earnings surprise of 4 per cent. Fewer companies exceeded earnings expectations, while more firms missed estimates, particularly in cyclical sectors, it added. The MF further underscored that over the past three years, rising interest rates have significantly impacted high-growth companies, which typically have longer durations. With the US Fed funds rate climbing to 5.25 per cent and India's reaching 6.5 per cent, high-duration assets like these companies faced greater pressure. As interest rates begin to decline, the future cash flows of high-growth companies are discounted at lower rates, boosting their valuations. While bonds see this re-adjustment almost instantly, the equities process takes longer, over months or years, depending on how rates change. PGIM Mutual Fund also pointed out that this valuation re-adjustment will continue as long as interest rates fall, providing a favourable tailwind for high-growth companies. However, once interest rate cuts level off, the pace of valuation re-adjustment will slow. The market is undergoing a clear shift, with high-growth, high-quality companies once again in favor. This shift is largely driven by expectations of a more dovish interest rate environment, which benefits these firms. While earnings expectations remain strong for high-growth companies, sectors may face headwinds due to weaker earnings. As interest rates trend downward, high-growth strategies will likely continue to gain traction, supporting the valuation of these companies.",

        "Article Content": "Expert Views: Sectors as Defence, Railways, Capital goods are still trading at elevated valuations, said Ajit Mishra \u2013 SVP Research, Broking Ltd talking to Mint. He prefers private banks and IT, despite short-term hurdles while advices Investors to exercise caution with mid and small-cap stocks. Mishra said that decline in crude oil prices, coupled with buying in select heavyweight stocks, is helping to limit the overall damage to the markets so far. Edited Excerpts Q1: What are the key concerns that are leading to pressure on the markets in past few sessions barring one yesterday? Markets have been under pressure, primarily due to global uncertainties, particularly stemming from the US. Weak US job data has raised concerns about a potential slowdown in the world largest economy, which could affect global growth prospects. Additionally, ongoing debate over the extent of the US Feds rate cut is contributing to market anxiety. On the domestic front, the continued underperformance of the banking sector is also dampening sentiment. However, the sharp decline in crude oil prices, coupled with buying in select heavyweight stocks, is helping to limit the overall damage so far. Q2: What are the possible ways in which markets can react to the outcome of the US FOMC meeting. Will just a 25 bps rate cut by US fed lead to disappointment for the markets? Recent U.S. data has sent mixed signals, and with a 25 bps rate cut already priced in, it\u2019s unlikely to trigger a major market reaction. We believe the Fed\u2019s guidance on inflation, growth, and future rate cuts will be crucial in shaping the broader market outlook, particularly regarding global liquidity and risk appetite. A 50 bps cut, however, could spark a positive response, especially from emerging markets like India. That said, the impact might be short-lived, as such a move could also raise concerns about the underlying strength of the U.S. economy. Q 3: What are the triggers that can lead to upside for the markets? We believe strong earnings growth in key sectors, along with a revival in private capital expenditure\u2014reflecting increased business confidence\u2014could provide the necessary catalysts for a sustained market rally. In addition to steady domestic inflows, continued support from foreign funds will be crucial to maintaining momentum. Furthermore, stability in global markets and positive developments in the U.S. political landscape could offer additional support to market growth. Currently, sectors like defense, railways, and capital goods are still trading at elevated valuations, driven by expectations of strong earnings growth. Investors should remain cautious, as any disappointment in meeting these expectations could negatively impact valuations. On the other hand, sectors such as and despite facing short-term hurdles, are presenting more attractive valuations. In this market environment, investors should adopt a long-term strategy with realistic return expectations. Q5: How should investors approach mid and small caps? How are they being valued now compared to large cap and Nifty valuations? Investors should exercise caution with mid and small-cap stocks in the Indian market, as their valuations are higher than historical averages. While the Nifty- 50 index is trading at a Price to earnings ratio of 23 times, the Nifty Midcap 100 index is significantly higher at 43x, reflecting its strong performance over the last five quarters. Given these stretched valuations, large-cap stocks offer a more favorable risk-reward balance, especially in sectors such as consumption, infrastructure, and banking. Investors are advised to prioritize large caps with reasonable valuations and growth potential, while being selective in their approach.",

Commenting on today's market performance, Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said, \"The market took a breather and ended on a flat note after the previous day\u2019s sharp uptick. Despite domestic CPI inflation being within RBI's target band, the increase in food prices may influence the central bank to remain prudent on rates. Higher liquidity from FIIs to the domestic market and a slide in US 10-year yield increased the prospects of the FED rate cut, which will aid domestic sentiment.\" For the week, the Nifty 50 surged by 2.03 per cent, marking its largest weekly gain since late June. The Sensex also finished the week up by 2.10 percent. Mid-cap and small-cap stocks extended their winning streak for a second consecutive session on Friday.

Stocks including Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri (TBZ), Kalyan Jewellers, Senco Gold, Motisons Jewellers, PC Jeweller, and Thangamayil Jewellery saw their shares surge between 4 per cent and 20 per cent. For regional jewellery businesses, rising gold prices can be particularly beneficial. These companies often keep a significant portion of their gold inventory unhedged, enabling them to capitalize directly on the price increases through inventory gains. On the other hand, larger players like Titan and Kalyan Jewellers typically hedge 70 per cent to 90 per cent of their gold holdings. Despite this, the unhedged portion of their inventories still benefits from rising gold prices. Jewellery stocks have been performing well recently, supported by multiple factors including a cut in customs duties on gold and silver from the latest Union Budget, increasing wedding jewellery demand, favourable brokerage outlooks, and anticipated strong sales during the upcoming festive season. :",

        "Article Content": "The Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index is a unique index developed by the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE) that offers a unique perspective on the Indian equity market specifically on the large-cap sector. Unlike traditional indices, which are typically weighted by market capitalisation, the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index assigns an equal weight to each of its constituents. This means that each company, regardless of its size, has an equal influence on the index's performance. Equal weight indices are based on the idea that giving each stock the same weight allows for a more and can potentially reduce the risk of market volatility affecting the index's performance. This approach contrasts with market-cap-weighted indices, where larger companies can significantly sway the index, potentially leading to higher concentration risk. For investors interested in the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index, there are multiple mutual funds that aim to replicate the performance of the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index.

The Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index offers an alternative to traditional market-cap-weighted indices, providing a way to invest in the Indian equity market with a focus on diversification and equal representation. Its performance and the investment vehicles that track it make it a noteworthy option for investors exploring the Indian stock market landscape. Unlike traditional indices that weigh constituents based on their market capitalisation, the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index assigns an equal weight to each of its components, ensuring a balanced representation that mitigates the influence of larger companies. The eligibility criteria for inclusion in the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index are as follows: To be considered for the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index, a company must already be a part of the broader . Companies are selected based on their full market capitalisation ranking. To be included, a company's rank based on full market capitalisation must be within the top 90. There is also a market capitalisation threshold that must be met. A company's full market capitalisation should be at least 1.50 times that of the last constituent in the Nifty 100. Liquidity is a crucial factor, and companies must exhibit a certain level of trading frequency and liquidity to be eligible. The average free-float market capitalisation of a company is also considered, and it must rank among the top 800 companies based on this criterion for the last six months. A company's listing history and impact cost are taken into account, ensuring that only those with a stable and established presence on the NSE are included. Lastly, the domicile of the company is considered, with the requirement that the company must be listed on the NSE. The Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index serves various purposes, such as benchmarking fund portfolios, launching , ETFs and structured products. The Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index represents a strategic choice for investors who value equal representation across various sectors and companies, regardless of their size.

Investing in index mutual funds that track the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index can be an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their and gain exposure to the Indian equity market. These funds offer a unique approach by assigning equal weight to each stock in the index, regardless of the company's market size. This method contrasts with traditional market capitalisation-weighted indices, where larger companies have a more significant impact on the index's performance. One of the primary advantages of these funds is the they offer. By investing in a fund that tracks the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index, investors can spread their risk across 100 different companies, reducing the impact of any single stock's performance on their overall investment. Historically, equal-weighted index funds have shown the potential to produce superior returns compared to their market-cap-weighted counterparts this is especially true in the case of the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index and has been discussed later in this blog. This is because the performance of smaller companies has a more significant impact on the index, which can lead to higher returns if these companies perform well. Investing in an index fund is a straightforward way to gain exposure to a broad range of assets. Investors know exactly what they are investing in and can easily track the performance of their investments. Index mutual funds typically have lower expense ratios than actively managed funds because they are passively managed. This means that more of the investor's money is working for them, potentially leading to better net . The Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index can be more volatile than market-cap-weighted indices. This is because the performance of smaller companies, which have a greater impact on the index, can be more unpredictable. Investing in the stock market involves a plethora of choices, especially when it comes to indices. The Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index and the Nifty 100 Index may sound similar, however, there are multiple differences that investors should be aware of. In the Nifty 100, companies with higher market capitalisation have a greater impact on the index's movement. Conversely, in the Equal Weight Index, all companies contribute equally to the index's performance. The Equal Weight Index is rebalanced periodically to maintain equal weightage. This involves buying shares of underperforming companies and selling shares of outperforming ones, which can lead to a contrarian investment approach. Historically, the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index has shown a tendency to outperform the Nifty 100 Index over certain periods. The Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index has shown higher levels of volatility over the year. The Equal Weight Index offers better diversification as it prevents the index from being overly influenced by a few stocks. The choice between the Nifty 100 and the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index depends on the investor's strategy and preference for market exposure. The Equal Weight Index may appeal to those looking for a more balanced approach, while the Nifty 100 might be preferred by those who believe in the market-cap-weighted philosophy. In conclusion, both indices offer unique advantages and cater to different investment styles. Understanding these differences is crucial for making informed investment decisions. The latest budget has brought about significant changes in the taxation of mutual funds, especially those tracking the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index. Investors looking to understand the impact of these changes on their investments will find that the new regulations can influence both the strategy and the returns of their . Investments in are subject to LTCG tax if the units are held for more than one year. The latest budget has revised the LTCG tax rate on equity mutual funds to 12.5% from 10% on gains exceeding 1.25 lakh in a financial year. This is a critical change for investors to consider when planning their investments and returns. If the units of the mutual fund are sold within a year from the date of investment, the gains are taxed at 20%. This remains unchanged and continues to incentivize long-term investments over short-term trading. The latest budget has introduced changes that could impact investors in mutual funds tracking the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index. It's crucial for investors to stay informed about these changes and consult with financial advisors to understand the implications for their investment portfolios. With careful planning and strategy, investors can navigate the new tax landscape and continue to make informed investment decisions. In conclusion, index mutual funds tracking the Nifty 100 Equal Weight Index offer a balanced approach to investing in the Indian equity market. They provide diversification, the potential for higher returns, simplicity, and lower costs. However, investors must also consider the limitations, such as increased volatility, and a limited track record.

        "Article Content": "In a recent study, Zerodha Fund House reported a remarkable surge in the adoption of (SIPs) among retail investors, positioning SIPs as a prominent mode of investment in mutual funds. The study highlights an exponential increase in both the number of SIP accounts and the contributions made, signaling a shift towards disciplined and regular investing. As of June 2024, SIP assets under management (AUM) represent approximately 20 percent of the overall mutual fund industry , underscoring the growing popularity of this investment strategy. The data reveals a significant rise in SIP accounts, with the number increasing by 59 percent from 5.28 crore in March 2022 to 8.4 crore in March 2024. This upward trend has continued into FY25, with the total number of outstanding SIP accounts surpassing 9 crore as of July 2024. SIP contributions have also shown substantial growth, climbing by 56 percent from approximately 12,000 crore to around 19,000 crore between March 2022 and March 2024, showcased the report. In the initial months of FY25, SIP contributions exceeded 23,000 crore, marking an impressive 89 percent increase from March 2022. Despite the growth in contributions and accounts, the average SIP amount has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 2,200 and 2,500 over the past few years, noted the report. Vishal Jain, CEO of Zerodha Fund House, emphasized the importance of maintaining discipline in SIP investments: \"To fully maximize the benefits of SIPs over the long term, investors should stay disciplined with their investments irrespective of conditions and also consider progressively increasing their contribution amounts in tandem with their growing incomes. This strategic approach to stepping up SIPs ensures that your investments keep pace with inflation and changing financial goals.\u201d Step-Up SIPs, a strategic variation of regular SIPs, present an advantageous approach for increasing investment contributions as income levels rise. This approach allows investors to adjust their SIP amounts in line with their income growth. Data illustrates the potential benefits of this strategy: A regular monthly SIP of 1,000 in LargeMidcap 250 TRI, from the inception of the index to March 2024, would accumulate an investment value exceeding 12 lakh, observed the Zerodha Fund House report. It further underscored that by incorporating a 5 percent annual step-up, the value of this SIP could grow to approximately 17 lakh by March 31, 2024. With a 15 percent annual step-up, the value could reach around 35 lakh, and with a 25 percent annual step-up, it could approach an impressive 84 lakh. This demonstrates how gradually increasing SIP contributions in alignment with income growth can lead to significant long-term wealth accumulation. For salaried individuals who typically experience annual salary hikes and bonuses, a Step-Up SIP strategy allows for an investment approach that adjusts contributions in sync with rising income levels. This method not only maximizes the growth potential of investments but also helps in building a substantial corpus over time. \"The idea is simple: As your income rises, a gradual increase in the SIP contribution may potentially lead to an accumulation of higher corpus in the long term. Most salaried individuals expect a yearly salary hike and may get bonuses on an annual basis. Hence, one may opt for an approach which steps up your SIP amount in line with the rising income levels,\" said the report. The data from Zerodha Fund House underscores the transformative impact of SIPs on the investment landscape, highlighting their role in encouraging disciplined investing. The continued rise in SIP accounts and contributions reflects a growing confidence in this investment strategy. Maintaining a disciplined approach and progressively increasing SIP contributions can help investors achieve their financial goals and build substantial wealth over the long term.",

        "Article Content": "In the past seven months of this calendar year, a total of 106 new fund offers ( ) were launched across mutual fund houses. These NFOs comprised 25 thematic and 31 index schemes, reveals the AMFI (Association of Mutual Funds in India) data. Out of these new schemes, 63 passive schemes were launched in the first seven months vis-\u00e0-vis 51 in the entire last year, reveals Ace Equity MF data. Passive are the schemes which replicate the performance of an index, and are managed passively by fund managers. They are typically more popular among investors because they are more cost-effective and easy to understand. Importantly, most active mutual funds , anyway. Therefore, investors tend to lap up passive schemes. Sridharan Sundaram, a SEBI-registered investment advisor and founder of Wealth Ladder Direct believes, \u201cMost of the new launches are thematic mutual funds in such sectors as manufacturing, business cycle fund and . There are quite a few reasons for this including the rallying of markets. Although the market is still overpriced, the sectoral rotation will happen. So, those investors who are looking for a buying opportunity can invest in sectoral funds. And if you want to invest in a benchmark , you should invest in a staggered manner and not in one shot.\u201d Additionally, passive funds do not necessarily replicate benchmark indexes. There are a number of passive funds which track a particular sector or theme such as defence, consumer durables or infrastructure, among others. \u201cAs more and more investors understand that generating alpha for a longer period from active mutual funds is not easy, they are more interested in passive mutual funds which are very cost-effective and a no-brainer for the investors. But somehow such investments are boring so to attract more and more investors, mutual fund companies apply new marketing strategies by offering sectoral/thematic passive funds. They are also coming up with Smart Beta funds to generate some alpha over plain vanilla passive funds,\u201d says Preeti Zende, a SEBI-registered investment advisor and founder of Apna Dhan Financial Services. In the month of July alone, 15 new schemes were launched comprising six index funds, six ETFs, two thematic and one multi cap. In the preceding month of June, 17 schemes were launched comprising 9 thematic funds, three ETFs and two index funds. In May, nine schemes were launched comprising 4 index funds, three ETFs and one thematic fund. ( ) When seen Quarter-wise, a total of 35 schemes were launched in the April-June quarter alone which comprised 11 thematic funds and 12 index funds. In March quarter, meanwhile, 56 mutual funds were launched comprising 13 and 11 . Some wealth advisors believe that the fund houses launch new schemes to draw more investors and inject fresh money into the market since inflows into existing schemes continue to decline over time \u201cFund houses have to invest in new strategies to attract new clients in the market. When the fund is old its inflow may reduce but any NFO with current sectorial flavour like defence, infrastructure, energy or even with name opportunities fund can attract new money in the market,\u201d adds Ms Zende. Meanwhile, she does not advise investors to opt for an NFO since one does not have any historical performance based on which one can assess the fund. Additionally, the risk gets even higher when you opt for a thematic fund. \u201cI never advocate going with any NFO as investing in the existing MF with a good track record of its performance is always prudent, which we can study and compare,\u201d she adds.",

        "Article Content": "Mutual funds that track the Nifty Microcap 250 index offer retail investors a unique opportunity to invest in the potential growth of small companies in India. These mutual funds aim to replicate the performance of the Nifty Microcap 250 index, which consists of 250 micro-cap companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The Nifty Microcap 250 index is composed of 250 companies listed on the NSE. This index excludes large-cap and mid-cap companies, and even the top 250 small-cap companies (based on market capitalisation) are excluded. Essentially, the index consists of companies that are outside of the top 500 companies listed on the NSE in terms of market capitalisation. The selection criteria ensures that these are actively traded companies with reasonable liquidity to facilitate investment and trading by investors. Historically, micro-cap stocks have been more volatile than their larger peers. This volatility can be attributed to various factors including lower liquidity, less analyst coverage, and higher sensitivity to market sentiment. However, this volatility also presents opportunities for higher returns, especially for investors who have a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon. Over the last year, the Nifty Microcap 250 has given a total return of 72.68% (as of 31st July 2024) whilst the Nifty 50 has given a total return of 27.84% (as of 31st July 2024). Mutual funds that track the Nifty Microcap 250 index provide exposure to a wide range of micro-cap companies, which are typically the 501st to 750th largest companies listed on the NSE of India in terms of market capitalisation. This diversification can help spread risk across many different sectors and stocks. Micro-cap companies often have the potential for high growth, which can translate into significant returns for investors. By investing in a mutual fund tracking the Nifty Microcap 250 index, investors can participate in the growth stories of these smaller companies that may not be as well-known or accessible otherwise. Investors benefit from professional fund management when they invest in . Fund managers are responsible for tracking the index and making investment decisions, which can be particularly beneficial for investors who may not have the time or expertise to manage their investments. Index funds, including those tracking the Nifty Microcap 250, are known for their low expense ratios compared to actively managed funds. This is because they are designed to replicate the performance of the index, which typically requires less active trading and management. Mutual funds offer liquidity, allowing investors to buy or sell their fund units on any business day. This provides flexibility and access to funds when needed. Investors can take advantage of systematic investment plans ( ) and systematic withdrawal plans ( ) with mutual funds, enabling them to invest or withdraw funds at regular intervals. Mutual funds are regulated and offer transparency in terms of holdings, performance, and costs. Investors can easily track the performance of their investments and the underlying assets. Microcap stocks can be more volatile and riskier than large-cap stocks, potentially leading to higher losses during market downturns. While stocks can offer significant growth potential, they are more vulnerable to macroeconomic challenges such as high interest rates. Microcap stocks may have lower liquidity, which can result in higher bid-ask spreads and difficulty in buying or selling shares without impacting the market price. The Nifty Microcap 250 index and the Nifty 50 are two distinct indices on the NSE, representing different segments of the market. Understanding these differences is crucial for investors when making informed decisions about where to allocate their capital within the Indian stock market. We have mentioned the key differences between the two indices below: The Nifty 50 index is composed of the top 50 large-cap companies in India, which are well-established with a solid track record of performance and stability. These companies are leaders in their respective industries and have a significant impact on the market movements. In contrast, the Nifty Microcap 250 index focuses on micro-cap companies, which are much smaller in terms of market capitalisation. These companies are often in the early stages of development and can offer high growth potential, but they also come with higher risks and volatility. The Nifty 50 provides broad exposure to various sectors of the Indian economy, including IT, financial services, energy, consumer goods, and healthcare. This makes it a representative index of the Indian market's overall performance. The Nifty Microcap 250, however, may have a different sectoral composition, with a higher representation of industrial, materials, and small-scale consumer companies. This difference in sector exposure can lead to varying performance patterns between the two indices. Stocks in the Nifty 50 index are highly liquid, meaning they can be bought and sold in large volumes without significantly affecting the share price. This liquidity is due to the large market capitalisation and the high level of investor interest in these . On the other hand, stocks in the Nifty Microcap 250 index are less liquid, which can result in higher bid-ask spreads and potentially more significant price impact from trade executions. The Nifty 50 is often preferred by investors with a long-term investment horizon who seek stability and steady growth. These investors are typically risk-averse and prefer the predictable nature of large-cap stocks. Conversely, the Nifty Microcap 250 may attract investors with a higher risk tolerance, looking for short-term gains and willing to invest in companies with the potential for exponential growth. However, these investments carry a higher risk of loss. Historically, indices like the Nifty 50 tend to have more stable returns over time, with less dramatic swings in performance. Micro-cap indices, such as the Nifty Microcap 250, can experience significant fluctuations, with the potential for both substantial gains and losses. This volatility is a result of the smaller size and lower liquidity of micro-cap stocks, as well as their sensitivity to market sentiment and economic factors. The Nifty 50 is a well-established index with a fixed number of constituents, and changes to the index composition are relatively infrequent. The selection criteria for inclusion are stringent, focusing on liquidity and market capitalisation. The Nifty Microcap 250, however, has a more dynamic composition, and changes to the index constitution are more frequent. The selection is based on full market capitalisation, and a buffer is used to reduce portfolio churn. Before investing, it's crucial to understand the fund's objective, the track record of the fund house, the expense ratio, and how it fits into your overall investment strategy. It's also important to note that while micro-cap stocks can offer significant growth potential, they also come with higher volatility and risk. Investing in micro-cap stocks requires careful consideration of risks. These companies often have less established track records, may face higher operational risks, and can be more susceptible to market downturns. It's crucial for investors to conduct thorough due diligence and consider diversification to mitigate these risks. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before choosing to invest in mutual funds tracking the Nifty Microcap 250 index. It's advisable to consult with a financial advisor to ensure that this investment aligns with your financial goals and objectives. The taxation of Nifty Microcap 250 mutual funds is similar to that of other equity mutual funds in India. The gains from these funds are classified into two categories: If the units of the Nifty 50 index mutual fund are sold within one year of purchase, the gains are considered STCG. These gains are taxed at a flat rate of 20% after the Budget 2024. For units sold after one year from the date of purchase, the gains are classified as LTCG. The tax rate for LTCG is 12.5% on gains exceeding Rupees1.25 lakh in a financial year. It's important to note that there is no indexation benefit available for LTCG on equity mutual funds. Several factors can influence the tax liability from an investment in Nifty Microcap 250 index mutual funds: As mentioned, the duration for which the investment is held significantly affects the tax rate. The investor's income bracket does not influence the tax rate for STCG or LTCG, as these are flat rates. Dividends received from the mutual fund are also taxable in the hands of the investor as per the individual's income tax slab rates. Tax planning is an integral part of investing, and understanding the taxation rules applicable to Nifty 250 Microcap index mutual funds can help make more informed decisions. It's always recommended to consult with a tax advisor to understand the nuances of taxation and how it applies to individual circumstances. The Nifty Microcap 250 index offers a window into the dynamic world of micro-cap investing in India. While it comes with its set of challenges and risks, it also holds the potential for significant returns for informed investors who understand the nuances of this market segment. Investing in a mutual fund tracking the Nifty Microcap 250 index allows for diversification, as it spreads the investment across various sectors and reduces the risk associated with individual stocks. Moreover, these funds are managed by professional fund managers who are adept at navigating the volatile small-cap market.",

        "Article Content": "A majority of Indian investors who invest in passive funds, tend to go with the largecap passive fund options like Nifty50-based index funds. But the passive space now has a lot of options. In fact, a few too many to be honest. We have the well-known Nifty50 and popular Nifty Next50. Then there are others like Nifty100, LargeMidcap250, Midcap150, Smallcap index funds and several factors and . In fact, at the time of writing, we have more than 135+ schemes in the passive fund space! But while most tend to focus on one market segment (or sector or factor), there is one interesting option that tries to bet on everything. And it is rightly referred to as - Total Market Index Fund. A while back, NSE launched a new index named \u2018Nifty Total Market Index\u2019 that aims to track the performance of the top-750 stocks by market capitalization. Having 750 stocks in one fund does seem a lot and definitely will give a high to advocates of diversification, but does it really help? We will see in a bit. But first, let\u2019s see what this 750-stock index will consist of. All the stocks that are part of Nifty500 and Nifty Microcap250, will find a place in the new index. And since stocks from all market cap segments like large, mid, small and microcap get a representation via a single index, hence the name Total Market Index. If we drill down a bit more, here is what lies under the hood: Till now, the closest thing to this new index was Nifty500. But while Nifty500 did a good job of providing proper representation to large, mid and small-cap stocks, it had no stocks from the Beyond-500 space of microcap stocks. So this Total Market Index (of 750 stocks) does address this gap. But does it really help diversify things or is it just an optical diversification (given a large number of stocks that are part of the index)? The NSE fact sheet about the Total Market Index shows that it is highly correlated with the Nifty50. As per the data provided by NSE, the correlation stands at an extremely high 0.98 over a 5-year period and 0.95 for a 1-year period. This means that more often than not, the return outcome of Nifty750 and that of Nifty50 might be similar. And the primary reason for this is that the Total Market Index will also be constituted based on market cap-based weights. So the stocks of larger companies in the index will naturally get higher weights in the index. So it is not that you are getting equal 25% exposure to all market caps like large/mid/small/micro-caps. The index will be heavily skewed towards the largecaps belonging to the top-100 segment. And the representation of smallcaps and more specifically microcaps (stocks beyond the top-500) will be extremely low, though not negligible. This is the same reason why investing in Nifty100 is not the same as investing in Nifty50 and Next50 as I wrote about it a while back. So all said and done, do you as an investor looking to invest in passive funds, consider investing in Total Market Index Fund? This is a new fund with a very small vintage. Hence chances are high that if you are a proponent of passive investing, you already have index funds that track Nifty50/Sensex and Nifty Next50 in your . So for you (and other similar investors) who already invest in largecap index funds (which cover the top 100 stocks), there isn\u2019t exactly a need for the new total market index fund. Just getting into another index fund to take incrementally higher (but still very small) exposure to stocks from rank 101-750 won\u2019t help much. But if you have yet to invest in a passive fund, then this is definitely an option on the table. However, even a Nifty500 index fund provides sufficient diversification to practically the entire usable stock universe in India. And even the structures are very similar. The Nifty500 Index fund has about 72% in largecaps, 17-18% in midcaps and 10-11% in smallcaps. Not surprisingly on the other hand, the Total Market Index with its monstrous portfolio of 750 stocks from the entire marketcap spectrum has 69% in largecaps, 16-17% in midcaps and 13-14% in smallcaps & microcaps.

        "Article Content": "If investing was as easy as looking at the winners from last year and investing in them, then everyone would be rich. But that is not how investing works. Just because something has worked in the past year doesn\u2019t guarantee that it will work again this year. And this is also what market regulators like and financial companies like AMCs keep warning everyone about with their disclaimer - But time and again, investors do chase funds that have done well in the last one year. They believe that since it did well last year, it will continue to do well over the next few years as well. It may happen once in a while (if the strategy has some inherent momentum around it), but more often than not, mean reversion kicks in and the fund doesn\u2019t do well. Statistically speaking too, it is highly improbable for any scheme/fund within a specific category to maintain its status as the top performer across various market cycles over multiple years. In fact, if one were to look at the top-performing funds of the last 1 year, then it shows that a whopping 12 out of the top-15 funds are non-diversified and sectoral/thematic in nature. Now this article isn\u2019t about sectoral/ but let me address it a bit as the table above shows that in the last 1-year, sectoral/thematic funds have done very well and hence, investors may be tempted to invest in many of them. If you zoom out a bit and look at the last several year\u2019s data, it will be clear that there is always a different sector/theme at the top each year. So practically speaking, you can\u2019t be getting in and out of a sector every year. Also, many sectors (themes) can take years to play out well. So having the patience to wait for good days is another challenge for most. In a way, it\u2019s like trying to ride a wave that you expect to rise soon. So you need to get your timing ride with such concentrated sectoral/thematic bets. If you time your entry well, then you can no doubt make a lot of money. But if you get it wrong, then you will suffer badly. Remember, that once a sector does well and you enter late, it might be years before the sector gets back in favour again. Hence, most small investors are better off without in sectoral or thematic funds. More sophisticated investors, who comprehend the inherent risks and the necessity for precise timing in entering and exiting these investments, might allocate a small portion (10-20%) of their portfolios to sectoral/thematic funds. That said and coming back, if relying solely on past 1-year performance is not advisable, how should investors go about selecting funds for their portfolios? While it is crucial to avoid making decisions based solely on the previous year's top performers, it is equally important not to rely exclusively on point-to-point returns from the last one, two, or three years. A more effective strategy is to look at the rolling returns for all funds first rather than focusing on specific time frames. In addition to analysing rolling returns, investors should consider a variety of factors, including the fund's risk parameters, its volatility in comparison to market benchmarks, its historical performance relative to these benchmarks, and its consistency ratios. Evaluating how a fund performs against its peers across different market cycles is also essential. Furthermore, conducting a qualitative assessment of the fund manager and their team's track record, along with the processes employed in portfolio construction, can provide valuable insights. However, this comprehensive analysis can be challenging, not only for retail investors but also for so-called experts in the field. Please don\u2019t misunderstand me. I am not saying that looking at past performance is wrong. But what I am saying is that it is never enough. You need to look at other factors to shortlist the funds that you may want to add to your portfolio for the long term. If you have been in markets for long, then you will agree with this - when a fund performs well for a year or two: it tends to attract a surge of new investors and fresh money. This influx can lead to the fund's assets under management ( ) growing significantly, which can then pose challenges for the fund manager to keep delivering good returns on a larger portfolio. To illustrate, consider the difference between driving a small car and a large truck on a highway. A small car can manoeuvre\u202fquickly and efficiently, while a larger vehicle may struggle to maintain speed and agility. This analogy highlights the potential issues that can arise when the size of a small fund grows too large due to the above discussed reason. In conclusion, it is crucial to avoid making investment decisions based solely on the last 1-year returns and then gravitating towards the top few funds. When constructing a mutual fund , diversification across various funds that invest in different market-cap segments and employ complementary investment styles is advisable. This strategy helps mitigate risks and should be effective for most investors.",

        "Article Content": "In the diverse world of , understanding the nuances between different types of stocks is crucial for making informed decisions. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) provides a clear classification system that helps investors navigate through large-cap and mid-cap stocks. Large-cap stocks represent companies that are the top 100 listed companies in terms of market capitalization, i.e., the value of their shares in totality. Conservative investors often favour large-cap stocks for their reliability and consistent performance. They are considered a safer investment compared to mid-cap and small-cap stocks, as they are less volatile during market fluctuations. However, this stability also means that may offer lower returns compared to their mid-cap counterparts. Mid-cap stocks, as per SEBI's classification, are those companies that rank from 101st to 250th based on total market capitalization. Investors investing in these companies are typically trying to strike a balance between the growth potential of small-cap stocks and the stability of large-cap stocks. Mid-cap companies are often in the growth phase of their business cycle, expanding their market share and exploring new opportunities. This makes them an attractive option for investors looking for higher growth potential. However, with higher potential returns comes increased risk, as mid-cap stocks can be more sensitive to market volatility. SEBI's classification system is designed to provide a standardised approach to categorising companies based on market capitalization. This system helps in creating a more structured investment environment and aids in creating diversified portfolios. The market capitalization of companies is reviewed every six months, using data from the end of June and December each year. This ensures that the classification remains current and reflects the latest market conditions. When choosing between large-cap and mid-cap mutual funds, investors must consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, and the time horizon of their investment. Large-cap mutual funds are suitable for those seeking stability and long-term growth, while mid-cap mutual funds are better suited for investors willing to take on more risk for the possibility of higher returns. It's also important to note that diversification is key in managing risk. A balanced that includes both large-cap and mid-cap mutual funds can provide a mix of stability and growth potential. The Nifty Midcap 150 Index, a barometer of India's mid-sized companies' market performance, is a pivotal index for investors looking to tap into the growth potential of midcap stocks. Representing the next 150 companies based on full market capitalization from the Nifty 500 after the top 100, the Nifty Midcap 150 is a diversified index that captures the market movements of mid-tier Indian companies. The Nifty Midcap 150 Index is designed to reflect the behaviour and performance of the mid-market capitalization segment of the financial market. The index is a significant indicator of the Indian economy's mid-segment. Eligibility Criteria for Inclusion in the Nifty Midcap 150 Index: To be considered for inclusion in the Nifty Midcap 150, a company must already be part of the Nifty 500 Index. This ensures that only companies that have already met the stringent listing criteria of the broader Nifty 500 are considered for the Midcap 150 index. Companies that rank among the top 225 based on full market capitalization are eligible for inclusion. This criterion ensures that the index captures the performance of companies that are significant in size and have a substantial presence in the market. A company's full market capitalization should be at least 1.5 times that of the last constituent of the Nifty Midcap 150. This requirement is designed to maintain the quality and stability of the index by including companies that have a relatively larger market capitalization, which can contribute to the robustness of the index. The index is computed using the free float market capitalization method. This means that the level of the index reflects the total market value of the free-floating shares of the companies in the index relative to a base market capitalization value. The index is reviewed and rebalanced periodically. This process ensures that the index remains representative of the mid-market capitalization segment of the Indian equity market. During the review, companies that no longer meet the eligibility criteria may be excluded, and new companies that meet the criteria may be included. The Nifty Midcap 150 Index not only reflects the performance of mid-sized companies but also provides insights into the economic trends affecting this segment of the market. For investors, understanding the eligibility criteria is crucial for making informed decisions, especially when considering index-based investment products. Investing in the Nifty Midcap 150 Index tracking mutual funds can be a strategic move for those looking to diversify their portfolio beyond the large-cap stocks. Midcap stocks often offer a balance between the growth potential of small-cap stocks and the stability of large-cap stocks. They are particularly appealing to investors who are willing to take on a moderate level of risk for potentially higher returns. As of July 31, 2024, the Nifty 150 Midcap Index has given a one-year return of 55.53%. It has given a 5 year compounded annual gross return of 31.58%. On the other hand, as of July 31, 2024 Nifty 50 Index has given a one-year return of 27.84%. It has given a 5 year compounded annual gross return of 18.92%. Please see below the top 5 index mutual funds (direct schemes) tracking the Nifty Midcap 150 Index basis their 1-year performance. Index mutual funds have become a staple in the investment portfolios of many, offering a passive investment strategy that aims to replicate the performance of a benchmark index. It is crucial to weigh the pros and cons to make an informed decision. : One of the primary advantages of investing in these funds is the they offer. By tracking the Nifty Midcap 150 Index, investors gain exposure to a basket of 150 mid-sized companies, spreading out the risk that would be present if investing in individual stocks. : Index funds are known for their lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds. This is because they are passively managed, eliminating the need for a fund manager to actively select stocks, which can lead to significant cost savings over time. : For new investors, index funds offer a straightforward approach to investing. There's no need to research individual stocks; instead, one can invest in a broad market segment through a single financial product. : Historically, midcap stocks have provided higher returns than large-cap stocks over the long term, albeit with higher volatility. This could potentially lead to better growth opportunities for investors willing to accept the associated risks. While diversification can mitigate some risk, investing in midcap stocks comes with higher market volatility. This means that the fund's value can fluctuate more significantly in the short term, which might not be suitable for all . The Nifty Midcap 150 Index may have a concentration in specific sectors, which can lead to sector-specific risks. If a particular sector underperforms, it can adversely affect the overall performance of the fund. The Union Budget 2024 has introduced pivotal changes in the taxation of equity index mutual funds, which are poised to significantly affect investors' strategies and returns. This detailed analysis below aims to elucidate the new tax regulations and their implications for mutual fund investors investing in mutual funds tracking the Nifty Midcap 150 Index. One of the most notable changes is the increase in the LTCG tax rate on equity-oriented investments from 10% to 12.5%, effective from July 23, 2024. This hike applies to gains exceeding the revised exemption limit of INR 1.25 lakh per annum, up from the previous INR 1 lakh. The removal of the indexation benefit, which allowed adjustment of the purchase price for inflation, further impacts the tax efficiency of long-term investments. The STCG tax rate on specified financial assets, including equity mutual funds, has risen from 15% to 20%. This increase aligns with the government's approach to streamline the tax structure and potentially dissuade short-term speculative investments. Post-Budget 2024, mutual funds are categorised for taxation based on their portfolio composition and holding periods. Equity mutual funds are those with more than 65% of their portfolio in Indian stocks, and they can avail of LTCG benefits after a holding period of over 12 months. Index mutual funds tracking the Nifty Midcap 150 Index are classified as equity mutual funds.

Index mutual funds tracking the Nifty Midcap 150 Index offer a blend of opportunities and challenges. They provide a cost-effective, diversified, and simple investment option with the potential for substantial growth. However, investors must also consider the risks of market volatility, limited upside potential, tracking errors, and sector concentration. As with any investment, it's essential to align your choice with your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

        "Article Content": "Prior to investing in a scheme, investors tend to examine the returns which the scheme has delivered in the recent past. It is also recommended to check the returns delivered since the launch of the scheme. When some money stays invested for a long period of time, the investment is likely to grow multi-fold, particularly during the later period of the tenure. The returns delivered in the first few years are appended to the principal, which collectively rises in the later years. This leads to disproportionately higher rise in the later years vis-\u00e0-vis earlier years, and is referred to as \u2018 \u2019. To demonstrate the power of compounding, we handpick one mutual fund scheme \u2014 \u2014 and examine the returns it delivered in the recent past. Let us suppose, an had invested one lakh in this scheme a year ago. The investment would have grown to 1.52 lakh now, exhibiting a 52.02 per cent growth. In a three year\u2019s tenure, one lakh investment would have swelled to 2.11 lakh by growing at 28.25 percent. Likewise, if an investor had invested this sum five years ago, it would have grown to 3.06 lakh by growing at an annualised rate of 25.08 per cent. In a 10-year period, the investment of one lakh would have swelled to 5.04 lakh by growing at a (compound annual growth rate ) of 17.56 percent. ( ) Meanwhile, if the investor happened to invest soon after the scheme\u2019s launch (i.e., June 29, 2004), the investment would have grown eight times to 8.09 lakh by growing at an annualised rate of 19.79 percent, shows the details on Tata Mutual Fund\u2019s official portal. Tata Equity PE Fund sticks to the value conscious style of investing. It aims to invest a minimum of 70 percent in equity and equity-related instruments of companies whose rolling P/E is lower than rolling P/E of S&P BSE Sensex. The fund uses several other qualitative and quantitative screens to buy companies in a bid to buy at cheap valuations. The top 10 constituent stocks are HDFC Bank, BPCL, Kotak Mahindra Bank, , NTPC, ITC, , , ICICI Bank and PFC as on July 31, 2024, reveals the data on Tatamutualfund.com. The monthly average assets under management (AUM) amount to 8,652.10 crore. The scheme\u2019s fund managers are Sonam Udaisi and Amey Sathe. It is, however, vital to remember that the historical returns of a mutual fund scheme do not guarantee its future returns. Put simply, the returns delivered in the past may or may not continue in the near future.",

They are similar to on several counts but offer more flexibility than the latter since there is no restriction on the proportion of allocation to stocks belonging to one category of market capitalisation i.e., small cap, mid cap or large cap. Here, we list out the returns given by flexi cap mutual funds in the past five years and shortlist the ones which gave more than 20 percent. There are 39 schemes in the category of flexi cap funds with total assets under management (AUM) of 4.20 lakh crore as on July 31, 2024. Out of this, an inflow of 3,053 crore was witnessed in July alone. At the same time, the number of multi cap schemes on July 31, 2024 stood at 26 (against 39 in flexi cap) with total AUM of 1.68 lakh crore. ( ) As one can see the table above, the highest annualised return of 36.98 percent was delivered by Quant Flexi Cap Fund followed by JM Flexicap Fund which spiked by 28.61 percent during this period. Other mutual fund schemes which gave over 20 percent return in the past half a decade include , , , and . It is important to note that the past returns of a scheme do not guarantee its future returns. In other words, the high returns delivered by one scheme (or a set of schemes) do not necessarily mean that they will continue to perform well in the future as well.",

        "Article Content": "In the last few years, defence as an investment theme has done well on the stock exchanges. The shares of some of the listed defence companies, like HAL, BEL, etc., have become multi-baggers and created wealth for their . Many investors have flocked to listed defence companies. Looking at the investors\u2019 preference for listed defence companies, two AMCs have launched defence in the last few months. Let us look at what these defence index funds are, the companies that are a part of them and their performance, and whether you should invest. Two AMCs have launched index funds on the Nifty India Defence Index. Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund launched the Motilal Oswal Nifty India Defence Index Fund in June 2024. Aditya Birla Sun Life launched the Aditya Birla Sun Life Nifty India Defence Index Fund in August 2024. So, before we get into the scheme details let us take a look at the Nifty India Defence Index. The Nifty India Defence Index has 15 constituents. The index tracks the performance of these companies that broadly represent the defence theme. The top 10 constituents and their weightages include the following: Let us now look at the performance of the Nifty India Defence Index. The index has a base date of 2nd April 2018 and a base value of 1,000. The above chart shows the spectacular rise the index has seen since April 2018. As of September 2024, the index is trading at levels above 7,000. In the last 6.5 years, the index has multiplied investor money more than seven times. The above table shows how the index has given excellent returns in the last one and five years and, thus, created tremendous wealth for investors. As of 31st August 2024, the index trades at a Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio of 56 times and a Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 16 times. So, the valuations of the index are expensive. In the above section, we saw how the index has performed very well in the last few years. Now, let us look at the performance of the index constituents. Let us take the example of Limited (HAL), which has the second-highest weight (18.23%) in the index. Let us look at the company\u2019s financial performance and the stock price performance of HAL. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited is one of the biggest defence PSUs in India. It designs, manufactures, and services aircraft, helicopters, etc., for the defence forces. In the last four years, the company has grown its annual profits from over Rs. 2,800 crores (FY 2020) to more than Rs. 7,600 crores (FY 2024) at a 32.9% CAGR. At the end of FY 2024, the company recorded revenues of more than Rs. 30,000 crores. At the end of FY 2024, the company had a huge order book of Rs. 94,000 crores, which is more than three times the FY 2024 revenues. So, the company has good revenue visibility for the next few years. The Government of India is focusing on strengthening India\u2019s Defence Forces with higher annual budgetary allocations. The budgetary allocations will translate into huge orders for defence companies like HAL. Hence, the order pipeline for HAL and other defence companies is very strong. With a huge order book outstanding and future order inflows expected, the timely order book execution, margins, receivables, etc., are key monitorable for the company. Based on the past good financial performance and in anticipation of future execution of the order book, the company share price has done exceedingly well. The above chart shows how the HAL share price has shot up from Rs. 336 in September 2019 to Rs. 4,792 in September 2024. In the last five years, the stock price has multiplied more than 14 times, creating huge wealth for its shareholders. We saw the performance of the overall index and one of its constituents, HAL. Similarly, other constituent companies, like Bharat Electronics Ltd. (BEL), Cochin Shipyard Ltd., Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd., etc., are sitting on huge order books. In the last few years, the government has been increasing budgetary allocations for strengthening India\u2019s Defence Forces. Here is a look at the defence budgetary allocations for the last few years. FY 2024-25 Rs. 6.22 lakh crores FY 2023-24 Rs. 5.94 lakh crores FY 2022-23 Rs. 5.25 lakh crores FY 2021-22 Rs. 4.78 lakh crores FY 2020-21 Rs. 4.71 lakh crores The above table shows how the budgetary allocations made for defence have been increasing in the last five years. These huge allocations have resulted in huge orders for various defence companies. In future also, the defence companies are expected to bag huge orders from the defence forces. So, the companies that are a part of the Nifty India Defence Index have good revenue visibility for the next few years. However, the financial performance will depend on the timely execution of the order book. Also, the valuations of these companies are expensive. Growth companies get higher valuations during a bull run like the one we are currently in. However, in the event of a correction, these companies usually fall more than others. The two AMCs, Motilal Oswal and Aditya Birla AMC, offer index funds on the Nifty India Defence Index. To decide whether to invest in the Nifty India Defence Index funds, you should work with a qualified and experienced financial advisor. They can help you list your and make a goal plan along with appropriate asset allocation to achieve the goals. For the equity component of your portfolio, you should first focus on building a portfolio of diversified equity mutual fund schemes. Once you do that, you may allocate a small percentage of your equity portfolio to sectoral, thematic, smart-beta funds. The Nifty India Defence Index funds come within the thematic category. These funds carry relatively higher risks than diversified equity funds and are meant for investors with a high-risk appetite. Hence, work with a good financial advisor who can make a customised financial plan for you and recommend mutual fund schemes that suit your risk profile.",

        "Article Content": "New Delhi: Prime minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday called for international cooperation on green hydrogen to scale up production, lower cost and promote research & development. Addressing the International Conference for Green Hydrogen 2024 in a video message, Modi said the G20 Summit held in New Delhi last year, under India's presidency, adopted voluntary principles for green hydrogen which would help in creating a common roadmap. He said that given the global nature of climate change, the solutions for tackling climate change would also have to be global in approach. The prime minister stressed the need for international partnerships to promote green hydrogen in efforts at decarbonization, adding that scaling up production, minimizing costs and building infrastructure can happen faster through cooperation. He also called for jointly investing in research and innovation to push technology further. \"All of us must remember -- the decisions we make now will decide the lives of our future generations\u201d, he added. Reiterating Indian plans to produce and export green hydrogen, Modi said: \"We aim to position India as a global hub for the production, utilization, and export of green hydrogen. The National Green Hydrogen Mission, launched in 2023, is a critical step toward realizing this ambition. It will drive innovation, build infrastructure, stimulate industry growth, and attract investment in the green hydrogen sector.\u201d Addressing the inaugural session of the three-day conference Union minister for new and renewable energy Pralhad Joshi said that along with the potential to generate investment opportunities worth 8 trillion, the green hydrogen mission would also help in creating 600,000 jobs. \"As we move forward, our efforts will also contribute to reducing carbon emissions by 5 MMT by 2030, positioning India as a beacon of sustainable development on the global stage\u201d, he said. Hardeep Singh Puri, the Union minister for petroleum and natural gas noted that India's commitment to achieving net-zero emission by 2070 involves a multifaceted approach, including a significant focus on green hydrogen. \"Our goal of producing 5 million metric tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 is a critical step in decarbonizing our economy. This will require an investment of $100 billion and the development of 125 gigawatts of new renewable energy capacity,\" Puri said. Along with reducing 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually, the mission will also generate substantial savings, he added. Puri was of the view that the success of the National Green Hydrogen Mission depends on the collaborative efforts of both the central and state governments, as well as industry partners. The second edition of the International Conference on Green Hydrogen which started on Wednesday in New Delhi, will conclude on Friday (13 September).",

        "Article Content": "My former headmaster, Shomie Ranjan Das, affectionately called Heady, passed away on the 9 September 2024, soon after his 89th birthday. He had the distinction of being the only person to have headed three leading boarding schools in India, namely, Mayo College, Ajmer, The Lawrence School, Sanawar, and The Doon School, Dehradun. His longest stint as headmaster was in Sanawar. As his daughter Shiraz wrote in her post on Facebook, he believed those were the best days of his life. Das was not the stereotypical headmaster\u2014the archetypal feared head. Rather, he was twinkle-eyed, with a d\u00e9shabill\u00e9 manner and a wry sense of humour. His looks and demeanour were deceptive\u2014he was a keen observer with a razor-sharp intellect and was aware of exactly what was happening at any given time. Little passed him by. Sanawar, my old school, was populated with children who came from North India, chiefly Punjab, but by the time Shomie Das left the school, it had seen a transformational change in its student body. As a believer in Nehruvian Secularism, as well as having been brought up in the Brahmo tradition, he ensured that there was both regional and religious representation in the student body. An accomplished orator, he had the whole school enthralled whenever he spoke. I have vivid memories of his descriptions. After a trip he took to the US, speaking of the plight of the homeless sleeping in cardboard boxes in New York City. A firm believer in social justice and that adage \u2018learn by doing,\u2019 he instituted that all students undertake some form of physical work. There were drives to clean up the campus, there was tree planting, which involved us using spades and pickaxes to dig holes for saplings, and students served in the dining hall, including the job of cleaning the tables of all dirty tableware, cutlery and food debris. Not that he was moralistic or a puritan. Shomie Das encouraged students to mix freely and have friendships with each other regardless of their gender. He was the most enthusiastic dancer at the dances. He had a sense of fun! There is a quote doing the rounds of social media attributed to him: \u201cIf there is one thing I could change, I would change the system of confining the children to within the four walls of a classroom. Children need movement\u2014it is important for learning and retention as well as mental health.\u201d After every class that was held, rather than teachers walking to classrooms, students would walk to the teachers\u2019 designated classrooms. It gave us a chance to stretch our legs. Before project work became a buzzword, an entire hour once a week was instituted to enable students to pursue some kind of project. This was not a graded activity, nor part of the curriculum. He encouraged exploration and set up systems which would enable children to decide for themselves what interested them. Shomie Das believed in pastoral care. Small groups of 5-10 children would have a tutor who they met once a week casually at the tutor\u2019s home, sat with during meals in the dining hall and went on an annual 7-10 day hike/trek. The teachers thus got to know the students in their group intimately and were alert to any signs of trouble and served as a first port of call. He himself led by example and his \u2018tute group\u2019 comprised the head boy and girl as well as senior prefects. He sat with his group during lunch and made sure that everyone rotated from the far end to the front so that he had equal time with each. He was instrumental in hiring teachers with diverse interests, some of whom were a little older than the senior students themselves. One such teacher, I recall, when I was in Prep School, decided to stage an adaptation of Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm. This resulted in the entire Prep School (Grades 4-6) deciding to go on a hunger strike to protest the quality and quantity of the food they were being given. The head of Prep School was apoplectic with rage and wanted the teacher sacked. Heady, however, would have none of it and was amused by the whole episode, even meeting with a student delegation to listen to their grievances. The strike soon petered out, as we little uns, who in any case had just gone along with our seniors on their say-so, soon gave way to our hunger! Das was supportive of his staff, as one recounted, \u201cWere it not for him, I would never have survived in the school. He actively encouraged open disagreements and discussions among the faculty, he thrived on this openness.\u201d Under Shomie Das, Sanawar transformed from a parochial school to one of the leading institutions in the country, imparting an all-round education There aren\u2019t many who stand as tall as he did\u2014an educator in the truest sense of the word. We were privileged to have been educated under his watchful eye and gentle guidance.",

        "Article Content": "New Delhi: The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) is planning to come up with a new forest fire mitigation playbook, including designing of forest fire equipment and customized machinery, two officials said. Forest fires begin after the monsoon and picks during the summer months. The forest fire season begins in November and ends in June. India recorded about 203,000 incidents in the last forest fire season (2023-24). More than 36% of forest cover is prone to frequent forest fires. 4% is extremely prone to fire, and 6% very highly fire prone, according to India State Forest Report 2019 by the Forest Survey of India (FSI). \u201cTherefore, we are gearing up for the next season with better equipment and customized machinery because climate change may further increase challenges. Nobody knew that Delhi would experience such bad heatwaves that affect forests, taking away moisture and drying wood substances. When fire runs longer, animals have no option but to move away and if habitation is near, it may also lead to a human-animal conflict,\u201d one of the officials said. As part of the plan, the MoEFCC is holding a two-day workshop early next month in Bhopal where it will brainstorm ways to come up with response or mitigation tools. \u201cThrough this workshop, we are bringing all stakeholders, including all state governments/UTs, potential industries, NITs and IITs under one roof. It's kind of brainstorming. It is still at the ideation phase, but the concept is about designing forest fire equipment and customised machinery. This will be response tools. The exact titling is ongoing,\u201d the other official said. \u201cForest fire cases are falling. We had around 203,000 large forest fire cases (spread across 40 hectares) in the 2023-24 forest fire season against 204,000 cases a year ago. Our endeavour is to reduce it as much as possible. At the same time, we need to equip people with operational-friendly equipment. This is our broad idea. We will likely discuss existing inventory and their operational effectiveness, efficiency, user-friendliness and challenges and explore design, customization, new and modern equipment in the workshop,\u201d the official added. However, environmentalists say that forest fire cases, frequency, intensity and burnt area have been on an increasing trend for the past two decades and call for immediate action at various levels. Queries sent on Tuesday to the secretary and spokesperson of MoEFCC remained unanswered at press time. Every year large areas of forests are affected by fires of varying intensity and extent. Based on the forest inventory records, 54.40% of forests in India are exposed to occasional fires, 7.49% to moderately frequent fires and 2.40% to high incidence levels while 35.71% of India\u2019s forests have not yet been exposed to fires of any real significance. Forest fire needs to be understood from two perspectives--ecosystem and loss and damage. From the ecosystem perspective, forest fire is essential to available forest because in the forest, many trees evolve with fire and rely on it to regenerate. Occasional fires can keep down fuel loads that feed larger, more destructive conflagrations. \"They also help forests to get rid of their natural wastes such as dry grass, tree needles, and thick bushes. Similarly, even for pests and diseases within the forest ecosystem, we need fire. So, fire to a certain extent is highly required for the survival of forests. If you completely remove forest fire, you will indirectly be taking off certain tress from the forest. Humans are not going and planting these trees. These are all planted by some animals or helped by nature in different ways like water, rain and fire. When fire lasts longer, it becomes a real challenge. Short fires are okay, but when they last longer and capture a larger area, it is serious. That\u2019s when we have to response. The effort is to bring it down, the second official said. \u201cFrequency, intensity, number of forest fire and amount of burnt area have been increasing for the past twenty years. This is due to climate change. In some years, there might be lower number of cases and the next year it is more than the previous few years. So, the overall trend is increasing. In some ecosystems, forest fire is natural. Some forests require fire to regenerate, but majority of forest fire in India is triggered by human activities whether they have burnt it because of collection of tendu leaves (Indian Ebony used for wrapping bidi) or clear forest area. Post monsoon, from January onwards the forest is dry, the temperature is high, and the air temperature is high. Climate change is creating a perfect condition for forest fire and humans are the trigger,\u201d said the founder-CEO of International Forum for Environment, Sustainability & Technology (iFOREST) Chandra Bhushan. \u201cForest fire causes air pollution, destruction of biodiversity, plant and animal lives, death of forest ranger, guard, local communities and tourists and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. Forest fire in Himalayas is now being linked to air pollution in Indo-Gangetic plains. Every tree you burn emits CO2. The impact is devastating.\u201d \u201cIn some cases, people burn forests for short-term economic gains. For example, ground clearance and bush firing is done for better tendu leaf collection. They do so for better leaves which can be rolled into bidis, but the long-term impact is devastating; it causes economic losses. The forest is destroyed, soil is degraded, and air pollution is there. In short, there could be some short-term economic gains but in the long run, it is an economic loss,\u201d Bhushan said. The annual losses from forest fires in India have been moderately estimated to be 440 crore. This estimate does not include the loss suffered in the form of biodiversity, nutrient and soil moisture and other intangible benefits. India witnessed the most severe forest fires in during the summer of 1995 in the hills of Uttaranchal and Himachal Pradesh in northwest Himalaya. An area of 677,700 ha was affected by fires. The quantifiable timber loss was around 17.5 crore, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization. The numbers and estimates may have gone up over the past two decades; the latest data was not found immediately. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to be done. One, some of the practices that are there for minor forest produce like using forest fire to collect minor forest produce need to be discouraged, communities need to be incentivized to ensure that those practices do not take place. Two, historically, communities have been engaged in forest fire control. We have close to 300 million people living in and around forests. So, we need to use the existing community to protect our forest and prevent forest fires. In short, we need to operationlise it, incentivise communities so that they can control forest fire, they can work with forest guards and forest officers to do this,\u201d Bhushan suggested. \u201cThe third agenda is to provide enough resources for forest fire control to forest fire department which means satellite monitoring, early warning system, availability of forest fire control equipment, preparation before the forest fire season. Most importantly, not to promote monoculture. Most forest fires are intensive in plantations or forests where monoculture is done.\u201d FSI has been alerting state forest departments towards forest fire incidents detected by MODIS sensor on-board Aqua and Terra Satellite of NASA and SNPP- VIIRS sensor, six times in 24 hours, and alerts generated by FSI are based on Near Real Time fire point data processed by National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad.",

        "Article Content": "Rahul Gandhi in US: Amidst a storm of criticism over perceived anti-reservation remarks, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi issued a clarification, asserting his support for expanding reservation limits beyond the current 50 percent. In an interview at the National Press Club in the US, emphasized, \u201cYesterday someone misrepresented my statement that I am against reservation. But let me make it clear \u2013 I am not against reservation. We will take reservation beyond the limit of 50 per cent.\u201d The controversy stemmed from comments Rahul Gandhi made during a session with students and faculty at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, where he highlighted systemic inequalities. The Congress will \"think of ending reservation when India is a fair place,\" Gandhi had said, and added, India is not a fair place at the moment stated, \"The elephant in the room is that 90 per cent of India \u2013 OBCs, Dalits, and Adivasis \u2013 don't play the game.\" Gandhi elaborated that the caste census is crucial for understanding how lower castes and Dalits are integrated into societal institutions, noting the lack of representation in top businesses, the judiciary, and media. Gandhi also mentioned, \"We want to understand what their social and financial position looks like... We also want to look at the Indian institutions to have a sense of India's participation in these institutions.\" He further stressed that the INDIA bloc wants to defend the Constitution and most of the alliance partners agree on holding a caste census, adding that 'two businessmen' should not run every business in the country. Speaking to a gathering of several hundred Indian Americans in Washington, DC, on Monday, criticized the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for its perceived discriminatory views towards certain religions, languages, and communities. The Congress MP emphasized that the struggle in India transcends politics, asserting, \"The fight is about whether a Sikh is going to be allowed to wear his turban in India or a kada in India. Or he, as a Sikh, is going to be able to go to a gurdwara. That is what the fight is about. And not just for him, for all religions.\" The Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha's statements have provoked backlash from the BJP leaders including Amit Shah, Piyush Goyal, Yogi Adityanath, which has accused him of making anti-national statements abroad, especially concerning his role as the Leader of the Opposition.",

I think that's a disaster. Media doesn't like to write about it,\" Gandhi was quoted by news agency PTI as saying. \"How would America react if a neighbour occupied 4,000 square kilometres of your territory? Would any president be able to get away with saying that he's handled that well? So, I don't think Modi has handled China well. I think there's no reason Chinese troops should be sitting in our territory,\" Gandhi reportedly said.

        "Article Content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to officially launch the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) for people who are 70 years or older by 23 September, the sixth anniversary of the health coverage scheme, according to an official aware of the matter. The National Health Authority (NHA), the implementing agency of PMJAY, is gearing up to start registering eligible senior citizens on to a specified portal. On Wednesday, Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw during a cabinet briefing said the government has approved the health cover for all seniors aged 70 and above irrespective of their income. This will benefit 45 million families with 60 million senior citizens with free and cashless health cover of up to 5 lakh per year. The government has budgeted 3,437 crore for this. Also read | \u201cPM may announce the rollout of the scheme very soon on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of AB-PMJAY. However, the date is still not fixed. NHA is fully prepared to implement the PMJAY for senior citizens 70 years of age and above,\u201d said the official. \u201cNHA is ready to initiate the registration process of all eligible senior citizens on a specified PMJAY portal.\u201d Eligible senior citizens would be issued a new card linked to their Aadhaar number on the AB-PMJAY portal, the official said. Currently, beneficiary families under AB-PMJAY are identified from the socioeconomic caste census of 2011, on the basis of certain deprivation- and occupation-based criteria. While some 107.4 million poor and vulnerable families comprising the bottom 40% of India\u2019s population were covered under the scheme initially, to 120 million families in January 2023, considering the growth of 11.7% over the 2011 population. In February this year, the scheme was further expanded to cover 3.7 million ASHAs (accredited social health activists), AWWs (anganwadi workers) and AWHs (anganwadi helpers) working across the country and their families. Senior citizens aged 70 and above belonging to families already covered under AB-PMJAY will get an additional top-up cover up to 5 lakh per year for themselves which they do not have to share with the other members of the family. Those eligible senior citizens who are already availing benefits of other public health insurance schemes such as the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS), Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) and Ayushman Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) have to choose between their existing scheme and AB-PMJAY. Those eligible senior citizens under private health insurance policies or the Employees\u2019 State Insurance Scheme will be eligible to avail benefits under the new scheme. AB-PMJAY is the world\u2019s largest publicly funded health assurance scheme by the number of people covered\u2014550 million. Industry experts welcomed the move and suggested fair reimbursement and timely payments. Read more | Probal Ghoshal, chairman, director and co-founder of Ujala Cygnus Healthcare Services, said senior citizens require specialized and consistent medical care and through the PMJAY scheme eligible senior citizens can now access critical treatments with greater ease and support. He suggested improvements like streamlined reimbursement processes and adjustments in coverage to deliver quality care under the scheme. \u201cExpanding the beneficiary base significantly may challenge smaller and medium-sized hospitals, which often work with tight budgets. The added demand from senior citizens, who require more care, could strain their resources. To ensure the scheme\u2019s success, it\u2019s crucial to set fair reimbursement rates and ensure timely payments. If not addressed, these issues could overwhelm smaller hospitals, impacting their ability to provide quality care for the elderly,\u201d said Dr Harsh Mahajan, chair of the Ficci Health Services Committee and founder of Mahajan Imaging and Labs. Queries sent to the prime minister\u2019s office and a health ministry spokesperson remained unanswered.",

        "Article Content": "Sitaram Yechury passes away: In April 2023, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar met communist party leader Sitaram Yechury at the CPI(M) headquarters in Delhi. After a brief meeting, the two leaders, part of a group, emerged from the iconic AK Gopalan Bhavan in National Capital's Gole Market only to be greeted by a battery of reporters. \u201cI have not seen so many people in this otherwise deserted building for decades,\u201d quipped Yechury, the before briefing journalists about what transpired in the meeting. Yechury, who on Thursday after a brief illness, was arguably one of the prominent leaders behind stitching up an opposition alliance \u2013 INDIA bloc ahead of the Lok Sabha elections 2024. Nitish Kumar was then meeting opposition leaders for an alliance against the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led (BJP). It\u2019s another matter that and joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ahead of the 2024 general elections. Yechury underwent treatment at till his last breath on Thursday afternoon. He \u00a0is survived by his wife, Seema Chishti, daughter Akhila and son Daanish. His eldest son, Ashish Yechury, passed away due to in November 2021. Many say Yechury was not a mass leader, yet he was known for winning friends and influencing people across the political aisle. doesn\u2019t have many leaders in Parliament, yet Yechury has remained a prominent opposition face for many years. While his friendship with the Congress leaders is known, Yechury was a rare communist leader who was pally with BJP leaders too. In 2022, a photograph of and Yechury laughing together at an all-party meeting had become a thing on social media. \u201cHe was also my friend with whom I had several interactions. I will always recall my interactions with him,\u201d Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said in a post on X. Yechury\u2019s camaraderie across party lines is not new. He was a key figure in coalition-building efforts in national politics in the 1990s when different Janata factions came together to keep the Congress party out. \u201cWith the passing away of Comrade Sitaram Yechury, India has lost a bridge that connected revolutionary vision to parliamentary politics, political theory to political practice, and the agenda of national politics to the last person,\u201d said , the convenor of Bharat Jodo Abhiyan. Born on August 12, 1952, in the then-Madras, Yechury received his primary education in Hyderabad before shifting to Delhi in 1969. He completed his Bachelor's from Delhi University\u2019s St Stephen\u2019s College before joining (JNU) for his master's. Soon, Yechury entered politics by joining the Students\u2019 Federation of India (SFI) \u2014 the Left\u2019s student wing \u2013 in 1974. A year later, he became member of CPI(M). He indulged in student politics at JNU when the veteran BJP leader late Arun Jaitley was a rising young leader of (ABVP). Yechury gave up his plans to pursue a PhD and instead was part of the resistance movement against Emergency in 1975. Not many would know that he was among the first student leaders who demanded the resignation of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He was arrested during along with Jaitley and Prakash Karat, to name a few. Yechury was elected as JNUSU president thrice between 1977-78 in the post-Emergency days. It was under his presidency that JNUSU forced to resign as the University\u2019s chancellor in October 1977. In 1978, Yechury became SFI\u2019s All India Joint secretary. Many say that Yechury\u2019s glory days were when he was a student leader in JNU. He shot to fame again in May 2004 by playing a key negotiating role when Left parties backed the first UPA government and pressured the Congress-led regime into policy-making. He also played a critical role in the talks with the government on the , which eventually became a reason for the Left parties to withdraw support to the UPA-I government under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Yechury, elected as the CPI-M general secretary in April 2015, was considered the inheritor of the legacy of late party leader Surjeet played a pivotal role in what many call the first coalition era of Indian politics during the National Front government of and the United Front government of 1996-97. CPI-M supported from outside. Yechury assumed the general secretary position at a time when the CPI-M was shrinking politically. It had lost its government in West Bengal in 2011. Today, the Left is only in power in one state -Kerala. It was also a time when the Opposition faced a setback in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, with CPI(M) winning only 9 seats, its weakest position since 1964. Yechury was re-elected as CPI-M general secretary for a second term in 2018. He served as a Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) from 2005 to 2017. Throughout his five-decade-long political career \u2013 from student leader to a Parliamentarian \u2013 Yechury remained steadfast in his commitment to Many called him a link to the Left\u2019s glorious past in Indian politics. \u201cHe believed deeply in Marxism but was often practical in his approach considering the changed political scenarios in the country,\u201d said a CPI-M leader. Yechury's last video on X was on August 22, in which he condoled with former West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. \u201cIt\u2019s my loss that I was not able to physically attend this memorial meeting and pay my homage to Com. ,\u201d he wrote on X. As part of the INDIA bloc, Yechury was often at the side of Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge or Rahul Gandhi. His death will be a big loss to the INDIA bloc and beyond. \u201cI will miss the long discussions we used to have. My sincere condolences to his family, friends, and followers in this hour of grief,\u201d said in a post on X.",

        "Article Content": "New Delhi: Heavy industries minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said the new electric vehicle (EV) subsidy scheme would spend most of its outlay, nearly 40%, on subsidizing public transport such as e-buses. The money will be spent on aiding state transport units and public transport agencies procure more electric buses. The ministry has allocated nearly 40% of the total outlay of 10,900 crore towards e-buses. The PM E-drive scheme will also have an outlay of 500 crore each for e-ambulances and e-trucks, Kumaraswamy said at a press conference on Thursday, adding that the scheme will also incentivize scrapping of road transport vehicles. The ministry is also in talks with the ministry of road transport and highways over pricing of e-trucks, officials said during the press conference. The government has set aside 4,391 crore to subsidize the procurement of over 14,000 e-buses in nine cities with populations over 4 million\u2014Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad. Also read | While allocating these buses, preference will be given to those buses that are being procured after scrapping old state transport buses through authorized scrapping centres (RVSFs) following the ministry of road transport and highways\u2019 Vehicle Scrapping Scheme guidelines, as per a ministry of heavy industries press release. The ministry of heavy industries will coordinate with central agencies and state governments, as well as the ministry of road transport and highways for rolling out EV charging infrastructure on highways, and the ministry of health and family welfare for consultations about e-ambulances, officials said. The scheme also has a 2,000 crore outlay for fast charging infrastructure to address range anxiety among consumers, according to a ministry of heavy industries press release from 11 September. \u201cAll charging infrastructure will be standardized,\u201d said Kamran Rizvi, secretary in the heavy industries ministry, at the press conference. The scheme proposes the installation of 22,100 fast chargers for electric four-wheelers, 1,800 fast chargers for e-buses and 48,400 fast chargers for electric two- and three-wheelers, as per the ministry. \u201cThere are two components to charging infrastructure\u2014the upstream infrastructure and the interface. We consulted with the industry and found that they have difficulties funding the upstream infrastructure, which includes the power supply. So we decided to subsidize that. We paid 80% of the cost of upstream infrastructure in the previous subsidy schemes, and this time we have promised to fund 100%,\u201d a senior government official said on the sidelines of the briefing. The PM E-drive scheme plugs gaps in previous subsidy schemes such as FAME and the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS), ministry of heavy industries officials said during the press briefing. FAME is short for Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India. Notably, the new scheme will use facial recognition technology enabled by the Aadhaar database to ensure that every individual purchases no more than one vehicle in every class of electric EVs at a subsidized price, a senior government official told reporters on the sidelines of the briefing. Read more | \u201cThe consumer will get the vehicle at a subsidized price after the dealer creates an electronic voucher using UIDAI\u2019s facial recognition technology. Then, both the dealer and the consumer will physically sign the voucher, and the dealer will then upload that attested copy of the voucher for the necessary parties to claim reimbursement from the government,\u201d the senior official said. \u201cFor consumers, the scheme remains the same.\u201d The new scheme will subsidize electric two- and three-wheelers. For e-bikes, the government will provide a subsidy of 10,000 for the first year, and halve it to 5,000 for the second, Kumaraswamy told reporters. The tapering of subsidies in India is aligned with the global trend of global subsidy tapering, officials said. For three-wheelers, the government will provide a subsidy of 50,000 for the first year and 25,000 for the next, while three-wheeler e-rickshaws are poised to get a subsidy of 25,000 for the first year and 12,500 for the next. The senior government official clarified that certificates issued to manufacturers under the EMPS will be valid for the new PM E-drive scheme, and that the government is in the process of creating a new portal for the new scheme.",

        "Article Content": "Kashmiri Member of Parliament (MP), Sheikh Abdul Rashid said on Thursday said that he would support the INDIA bloc candidates in the upcoming Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections if the opposition promises to restore Article 370 of the Constitution whenever they come to power at the Centre. Popularly known as , the Baramulla MP, was released on interim bail on Wednesday to campaign for the elections in the Union Territory. \"If INDIA alliance assures us that it will restore Article 370 when it comes to power in Delhi, I will tell every candidate of mine to pledge each vote of their supporters for them,\" Rashid, who won the Lok Sabha elections against National Conference Vice President , told reporters in Kashmir on Thursday, news agency PTI reported. The Article 370 that have special status to Jammu and Kashmir was abrogated in August 2019. Rashid was released on interim bail by a court on Wednesday. He said if India has to achieve the dream of being a global power, it will have to address the \"If India has to be Vishwaguru, Kashmir has to be resolved. If you (Modi) have a better solution, please tell us. You are saying that the other side (of Kashmir) wants to join this side. It may be true as well but how do we find out?\" he asked. \u2019s Awami Ittehad Party (AIP) has fielded 34 candidates in the assembly elections. His younger brother, Khurshid Ahmad Sheikh, is also a candidate from Langate seat in north Kashmir\u2019s Kupwara district. who has been in jail since 2019 in a terror-funding case, has been an MLA from Langate seat twice. The firebrand politician, who is facing charges of terror funding, said if he is being branded as a separatist for talking about resolution of the Kashmir issue, then the entire north region was secessionist as they have voted for him. \"I want to make it clear that we are neither enemies of India, nor agents of Pakistan. We are agents of our conscience. Modi has snatched everything from us on August 5, 2019 \u2013 illegally and unconstitutionally,\" he said. The three-phased polls in the Union Territory end on October 1 and the results will be declared on October 8. He said Article 370 will not be restored by making statements inside the comfort of homes. \"How will 370 come back? You will have to protest at Lal Chowk and be ready to be hit by batons. But they (National Conference and PDP) cannot do it. When said no one can give back the statehood to Jammu and Kashmir except the BJP government, they did not even dare to say we will fight for it. It does not mean one has to be violent. Gandhiji did it through non violence,\" he added. Rashid said that National Conference leader was aware in advance that the Centre is going to revoke Article 370. \"The vote for me was not emotional outpouring. It was against Modi's Naya Kashmir. It was a vote for work that I had done in Langate (assembly segment) on human rights and development,\" he said, adding he had secured only 600 votes less than the runner up candidate in the 2019 assembly elections. The MP also predicted that both Peoples Conference president Sajad Lone and Omar Abdullah will lose the assembly elections from both seats that they are contesting. While Lone is contesting from Handwara and Kupwara segments, Abdullah is a candidate from Ganderbal and Budgam seats. Fifty-seven-year-old Rashid was in the news during the when he defeated former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah by over two lakh votes in the Baramulla seat in north Kashmir. Rashid's win is a shocker since he contested the elections from Tihar jail, where he has been for the last five years facing charges under the (UAPA). Rashid contested the election as an independent candidate and unlike in assembly elections he was not allowed to campaign during Lok Sabha polls.",

        "Article Content": "New Delhi: It could be E4 instead of BioE3 (biotechnology for economy, environment and employment) to bolster sustainability through energy transition amid looming concern over rising global temperatures, said Ajay Kumar Sood, principal scientific adviser to the government, on Thursday. India launched the BioE3 policy last month to foster high-performance biomanufacturing aligned with national initiatives of the Union government such as a net-zero carbon economy and Mission LiFE ( ). \u201cInstead of E3, it can easily be E4\u2014the fourth E stands for energy transition. We are passing through a crisis of global heat warming. So, energy transition is a must in this effort and the biofuels and circular economy are essential for our sustainability in the long run,\u201d Sood said at the fourth edition of the Global Bio-India summit. \u201cThe success of the biotech innovation ecosystem hinges on the active involvement of diverse stakeholders, including research institutes, universities, companies, investors and governments, and these entities must be collaborating to foster a sustainable environment through networks, regulatory and policy support and the promotion of innovation with intellectual property right protection. The integration of technology into biology has strengthened the foundation of biotechnology over the past decades.\u201d India\u2019s biotechnology industry is growing rapidly. According to the released on Thursday, over the past decade, India\u2019s bio-economy has grown significantly, from $10 billion in 2014 to $151 billion by the end of 2023. \u201cWe expect this to reach $300 billion by 2030. This growth is driven by increasing demand for vaccines and biopharmaceuticals in both domestic and international markets, and highlights the sector\u2019s increasing significance as it now accounts for 4.25% of India\u2019s gross domestic product of $3.55 trillion in 2023 calendar year.\u201d India has consolidated its position as a top global vaccine manufacturer. According to the World Health Organization\u2019s , the Serum Institute of India\u2019s share of the global vaccine market, excluding covid-19 vaccines, increased from 19% in 2021 to 24% in 2023. This growth was largely driven by a rise in the production of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), measles-rubella (MR) vaccine and tetanusdiphtheria (Td) vaccine. The adoption of new technology platforms also played a crucial role in scaling up covid-19 vaccine production. Indian manufacturers supplied 25% of the vaccines purchased by the WHO, with a considerable portion consumed domestically. Moreover, India exported a substantial quantity of vaccines to the Africa, making up approximately 20% of its total exports. \u201cThere is no better time than now to harness the rapidly evolving capabilities of artificial intelligence, and the new dimensions opened by quantum technology. The scope of biotechnological advancements is also a crucial objective of achieving a carbon-neutral future for a sustainable and greener planet. Integrating innovative approaches such as carbon sequestration from algae and conversion to biofuels, engineered microbes for carbon capture and the development of bioenergy crops hold potential to create zero carbon footprint on our planet,\u201d Sood said. India aims to reach net zero by 2070. Algae can be 10 to 50 times more effective at capturing carbon dioxide than other vascular plants. For example, , a type of green microalgae, can be 400 times more efficient than trees at carbon capture. Algae can also remove nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus from water bodies and absorb heavy metals and other pollutants. This process is called bioremediation. \u201cAnother method of driving innovation is biomanufacturing, leading to the development of new biomaterials and advanced medical therapies as we have learnt an essential lesson. We have witnessed the power of biotechnology innovation to unify the global response against unpredictable biological threats,\u201d the principal scientific adviser said. The BioE3 Policy is a forward-looking initiative that harnesses the potential of biomanufacturing to drive green growth. This framework is designed for Indian institutions, startups, and industries to engage in transformative innovations that address the intertwined challenges of climate change, resource efficiency and economic development. Biomanufacturing, which uses engineered biological systems to produce commercially important products, offers a sustainable alternative to traditional manufacturing processes. By utilizing resources more efficiently and reducing environmental impact, biomanufacturing can play a key role in building a greener and more resilient economy.",

Rashid, who was released on from Delhi\u2019s Tihar Jail on Wednesday after five-and-a-half years, was overwhelmed soon after he landed at Srinagar airport and prostrated on the road, kissing the soil of Kashmir. \u201cDon't lose heart, my people. Truth is on our side. Nobody can suppress our voice be it (Prime Minister) or (Union home minister) Amit Shah. We don't seek alms. We only want to be treated as humans.

The gathering raised slogans of \u201cTihar ka badla vote se, zulm ka badla vote se, UAPA ka badla vote se (Revenge of Tihar, atrocities and UAPA through votes).\u201d Rashid claimed that the outcome of the elections weren\u2019t important for him. \"For me, the election isn't important but the resolution of the Kashmir issue holds high importance,\" he said, adding that the banned had made a lot of sacrifices. \"They (Jamaat) have made many contributions and sacrifices but first I will have to talk with them and their leaders about J&K's interests,\" he said. Rashid also ruled out any alliance with the BJP. \u201cOmar Abdullah says I will be jailed after October 2. I want to ask him if, according to him, I am working for the BJP then why will they put me in Tihar again,\u201d he said, predicting the elections would bring about a big change in J&K. \u201cIf Omar Abdullah will only accompany me up to Tihar Jail the day I am taken back, I promise we will withdraw candidates against him from and Budgam,\u201d he said, seeking support from people to strengthen his hands.",

        "Article Content": "During the August \u2013 September period, three AMCs have launched multi-cap funds. Apart from these, several other from various AMCs already exist. In the last three years, the multi-cap category assets under management (AUM) have grown from over Rs. 24,000 crores to over Rs. 1,50,000 crores. The AUM has grown more than six-fold growth at an 85% CAGR. So, what are these multi-cap funds, how have they performed, and should you invest in them? Let us discuss. A multi-cap mutual fund has to invest a minimum of 75% of its total assets in equity and equity-related instruments. The 75% investment must be as follows: The fund manager can deploy the remaining 25% of the scheme money at their discretion. So, a multi-cap fund gives you a minimum of 25% exposure to each category (large, mid, and small-cap equity) within a single scheme. In the multi-cap category, an investor can choose from active and passive funds. In the active category, you will get at least 25% exposure to each equity category: large, mid, and small-caps. The fund manager has the flexibility to deploy the remaining 25% corpus across these equity categories, other asset classes, cash, or a combination of these. For example, PGIM India Mutual Fund has recently (NFO from 22nd August to 5th September 2024) launched PGIM India Multicap Fund (active fund). Within the passive category, you can choose from multi-cap ETFs and index funds. For example, HDFC MF has launched the HDFC Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index Fund, an \u2013 NFO period 6th to 20th August 2024. Similarly, Mirae Asset MF has launched Mirae Asset Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 ETF, an ETF \u2013 NFO period from 12th to 26th August 2024. For both the passive funds (HDFC and Mirae Asset MF) and the active fund (PGIM India MF), the benchmark index is the Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index. So, let us understand what this index is, its composition, performance, etc. The Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index comprises of the following 500 stocks: So, the Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index gives you exposure to India\u2019s top 500 listed companies as per market capitalisation. The weightage of the companies in the index is as follows: Within each segment, the weightage assigned to each company is based on its free float market capitalisation. For example, the 50% weightage of the large-cap companies is divided among the 100 companies based on each company's free float market capitalisation. The same applies for the 25% weightage distribution of the 150 mid and 250 small-cap companies. Depending on the performance of the large, mid, and small-cap segments, the 50:25:25 ratio will change. For example, if the large-cap segment does better than the other two segments, the weightage of the large-cap segment will increase above 50% and that of mid and small-cap will go below 25% each. The index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis. It means that on a quarterly basis, the weightage of large, mid, and small-cap segments is reverted to the base ratio of 50:25:25. Now that we understand the Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index and its composition, let us look at its performance. The index has a base date of 1st April 2005 and a base value of 1,000. As of 6th September 2024, the index is trading around levels of 16,471. The index has given a return of 17.09% CAGR since its inception. These are good returns. The above chart shows how the index has multiplied more than 16 times in the last 19 years and created wealth for its investors. After seeing the good individual performance of the Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index, let us compare its performance with the Nifty 500 and Nifty 50 indices. The data above shows how the Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index has outperformed the Nifty 500 and Nifty 50 indices across all investment horizons. Among the segments, one segment hasn't consistently outperformed the other two. Among the three segments, winners keep rotating year after year. Hence, investors may consider taking exposure to all three segments. The above chart shows, how in the last 19 years: However, there is no clear pattern or consistency of any segment outperforming the other two. Hence, investors may want to take exposure to all three segments through a multi-cap fund. If you want to take exposure to all sectors of the economy, one segment will not provide the same. For example: Hence, if you wish to have a spread across all sectors through a single scheme, consider investing in a multi-cap fund. Some of the benefits of investing in the Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index include the following: It gives you exposure to a diversified portfolio of India\u2019s top 500 companies, including large-cap (50%), mid-cap (25%), and small-cap (25%) segments spread across sectors all through a single scheme. Suppose you take exposure across the large, mid, and small-cap segments through three separate schemes. You will have to do the rebalancing manually. It will involve redeeming the units of one scheme and buying schemes of another. Redemption of units will have capital gain tax implications. However, in the Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index, the portfolio rebalancing is done quarterly. When the fund manager does it internally within the scheme, there are no capital gain tax implications for the investor. As seen in the earlier sections, the Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index has given good returns in the past on a standalone basis, as well as compared to the Nifty 500 and Nifty 50 indices. However, the past performance is no guarantee of future returns. While investing in the Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index has the above benefits, there are risks involved. It being an , it is meant for investors with a high-risk appetite. You should work with a qualified and experienced financial advisor who can do comprehensive financial planning for you and make a roadmap to achieve your financial goals. Based on your risk profile and other parameters, they can guide you on whether and how much to invest in active or index funds that can give you exposure to the Nifty500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index.",

        "Article Content": "If you are a lay investor and plan to invest in a new scheme, you undoubtedly have several options. However, most options are likely to fall into thematic or sectoral schemes. In August alone, four asset management companies (AMCs) rolled out thematic mutual fund schemes, including the Bank of India Business Cycle Fund, a manufacturing mutual fund by Invesco India and a business cycle fund by Motilal Oswal. The latest AMFI ( ) data released on Tuesday revealed that there are 179 thematic mutual funds in the entire mutual fund universe, which is\u2014hold your breath\u2014more than the total of all key categories put together, i.e., small cap, mid cap, large cap, flexi cap, and multi-cap mutual funds. Several mutual fund houses have recently launched several sectoral/thematic mutual fund schemes. These include the SBI Innovative Opportunities Fund and the ( ) But why are mutual fund houses launching aplenty? Some wealth advisors believe that asset management companies (AMCs) use them as a tool to garner more money from investors along different themes. But can\u2019t they also do this by launching schemes in other categories? While shedding light on this, Sridharan Sundaram, founder of Wealth Ladder Direct, says that since Sebi introduced the fund categorisation of mutual fund schemes in 2017, fund houses are not left with too much leeway in other categories. This means that the definition of a scheme as small cap, flexi cap, mid-cap, or is well-defined. One fund house can launch only one scheme in each category, leaving fund houses with little legroom for launching schemes in the existing categories. \u201cThese fund houses tend to launch new schemes to garner more funds. Even investors also want new themes and categories to invest their money, which prompts these AMCs to roll out new schemes in sectoral funds,\u201d says Sundaram. \u201cAnother reason for launching new is that schemes can\u2019t do sectoral rotation because each constituent stock may have an investment of around 300-400 crore, so it is difficult to exit these investments,\u201d he elucidates. Echoing similar sentiments, Preeti Zende, a Sebi-registered investment advisor and founder of Apna Dhan Financial Services, says, \u201cSectoral or thematic funds are favourite among investors for quite some time as some specific themes are in the news due to special emphasis given by the Centre. These include defence, infrastructure, railways, shipping, EV and manufacturing. So, many companies from these sectors get more cash flow, and their valuations are now skyrocketing. To garner the investors' interest and to be part of this euphoria, many AMCs prefer to launch such sectorial and thematic funds to attract more and more investment.\u201d \"But investors should be very careful since these sectors are already overheated, and a bubble is already created in some parts. So instead of betting on any sector or theme, investing in diversified equity mutual funds and managing your risk is better,\" she adds. \u201cThe Indian growth rate and other initiatives of the Government such as Make in India, defence sector spends and so on have given strong impetus to some key sectors such as manufacturing, defence, exports and so on. Companies in these sectors have projected good outlook for growth over the 5 to 10 years. There is an opportunity which needs to be capitalised by investing in these sectors. A sectoral fund can explore complete potential of these sectors. The investors also get a good option of participating in these sectors. Therefore, we have seen an uptick in sectoral fund launches,\u201d says Nitin Rao, Head Products & Proposition, Epsilon Money Mart.",

These schemes saw an inflow to the tune of 3,513 crore in August 2024, second-highest inflow after , which witnessed an inflow of 18,117 crore, reveals the . Flexi cap schemes have, undoubtedly, become quite popular among retail investors. Overall, there are a total of 39 schemes in this category with total AUM of 4,29,311.51 crore, second-highest in terms of asset size after sectoral schemes. Flexi cap mutual funds refer to the schemes which invest a minimum of 65 percent of assets in equity and equity-related instruments. This is the newest category of announced via a Sebi circular dated Nov 6, 2020 \u2014 according to which \u2014 these schemes can invest across large cap, mid cap and small cap stocks. ( ) As one can see in the table above, August saw the highest inflow into flexi cap schemes when compared to the inflows in preceding months. Financial advisors suggest that flexi cap mutual funds comprise a good category of schemes, offering flexibility to mutual fund houses to invest in the stocks across market capitalisation i.e., , mid cap and large cap in any ratio. This is unlike multi cap schemes where fund houses are mandated to invest a minimum of 25 percent in each of the three categories. Because of this inherent flexibility, fund houses can invest across stocks and therefore, have a higher chance of earning higher returns. ( ) As we can see in the table above, flexi cap mutual funds \u2014 as a category \u2014 have delivered double-digit returns in the recent past across tenures. While the past one-year returns of flexi cap mutual funds stood at 37.20 percent, the past five-year annualised returns were also high at 22.04 percent. Interestingly, multi cap funds \u2013 as a category \u2013 also performed significantly well and their returns were quite similar to those of flexi cap mutual funds.",
