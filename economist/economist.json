Early Monday morning, as share prices crashed in Tokyo, the markets were on our mind. Later that day, Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister of Bangladesh, fled her country, ending 15 years of increasingly autocratic rule. And by Tuesday, Britain was gripped by what seemed to us to have become its worst race riots since the second world war. All the while we were watching out for a catastrophic escalation of the fighting in the Middle East. Hardly the dog days of August. Traders say that buying and selling in a crashing market is like catching a falling knife. It\u2019s the same with market covers: you never know whether a plunge like the one we saw on Monday is just the beginning of the red ink or a passing scare. Fortunately, if there was no crash, we had a theme there in front of us, because the fundamental cause of the sell-off was anxiety about an American recession.",

This is a rare opportunity to join our staff at a senior level covering one of the most dynamic regions in the world with a population of 2bn. The South Asia bureau chief leads our coverage of the politics, political economy and foreign policy of India and other countries in South Asia. The default location is Delhi although we would be prepared to consider other locations. The mandate is to produce agenda-setting cover stories and other journalistic projects, using our full suite of digital channels. It\u2019s an exciting time to be covering India. Narendra Modi\u2019s government has returned with a weakened mandate, making the next few years a test case of how democracy can thrive again after a period of strongman rule. India\u2019s economy is growing at speed and its clout in the world continues to rise. Outside of India the region features fragile governments in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, which are also geopolitical swing-states. These countries are likely to produce news, as the Gen Z revolution in Dhaka has just shown.  has been investing in India: we have a dedicated Essential India newsletter, which has already reached a large number of readers. \u201cThe Modi Raj\u201d podcast was an example of the kind of ambitious journalism we want to excel at. Our coverage of the election was spread over cover leaders, videos, data journalism and podcasts. Stories about India are popular among our subscribers, particularly those in America. As well as the editorial effort   has a large number of commercial staff in India and liaising with them is part of the job. We are open minded about candidates. Journalistic experience and professional experience of India are helpful but not essential. The right person could be a foreign correspondent looking for a new challenge in a different region, a rising star ambitious to make their mark, or a superb thinker who knows India and wants to cover it. Applicants should send a CV, a cover letter and an unpublished article of 600 words suitable for publication in   by October 4th to  .\u00a0",

It was therefore a stunning coup when the United States arrested Mr Zambada on July 26th along with one of El Chapo\u2019s four sons, Joaqu\u00edn G\u00fazman L\u00f3pez, in Texas.",
